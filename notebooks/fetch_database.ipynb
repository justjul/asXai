The factors included prior academic experience, prior computer experience, self-perception of programming performance and comfort level on the module and specific cognitive skills. The study found that a student's perception of their understanding of the module had the strongest correlation with programming performance, r=0.76, p‹0.01. In addition, Leaving Certificate (LC) mathematics and science scores were shown to have a strong correlation with performance. A regression module, based upon a student's perception of their understanding of the module, gender, LC mathematics score and comfort level was able to account for 79% of the variance in programming performance results.",

         "Objective—The high and low responder phenomenon describes individual differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) activity. We characterized patterns of intracellular accumulation, externalization, and shedding of TF in response to LPS in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). Methods and Results—After 2 hours of LPS stimulation of whole blood, flow cytometry analyses revealed a larger population of TF-positive monocytes in HRs (32.0±3.5%) versus LRs (11.2±1.2%; P≤0.05), along with a stronger mean fluorescence intensity of TF signal in HRs (7.1±0.5 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with LRs (5.4±0.4 AU; P≤0.05). The LPS-treated blood of the HR group contained 2-fold more TF-positive microparticles than LRs. In-cell Western assay demonstrated higher intracellular accumulation of TF in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from LRs because LPS induced a 3.7-fold increase of total TF levels in LRs versus a 1.5-fold increase in HRs. In contrast, in response to LPS stimulation, MNCs from HRs exhibited a 4-fold induction of surface TF, whereas MNCs from LRs only had a minor increase in surface TF levels. Conclusions—The higher availability of surface TF antigen on MNCs from HRs and TF-containing microparticles might make these individuals more susceptible to hypercoagulation.",

In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.",

         "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

         "Abstract Laboratory natural selection and artificial selection are vital tools for addressing specific questions about evolutionary patterns of variation. Laboratory natural selection can illuminate whether a putative selective agent is capable of generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits and the extent to which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss theoretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken beyond model organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation.",

         "The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events. We recorded neurons from the basolateral complex of two monkeys while they performed visually cued schedules of sequential color discrimination trials, with both valid and random cues. When the cues were valid, the visual cue, which was present throughout each trial, indicated how many trials remained to be successfully completed before a reward. Seventy-six percent of recorded neurons showed response selectivity, with the selectivity depending on some aspects of the current schedule. After a reward, when the monkeys knew that the upcoming cue would be valid, 88 of 246 (36%) neurons responded between schedules, seemingly anticipating the receiving information about the upcoming schedule length. When the cue appeared, 102 of 246 (41%) neurons became selective, at this point encoding information about whether the current trial was the only trial required or how many more trials are needed to obtain a reward. These cue-related responses had a median latency of 120 ms (just between the latencies in inferior temporal visual area TE and perirhinal cortex). When the monkey was releasing a touch bar to complete the trial correctly, 71 of 246 (29%) neurons responded, with responses in the rewarded trials being similar no matter which schedule was ending, thus being sensitive to the reward contingency. Finally, 39 of 246 (16%) neurons responded around the reward. We suggest that basolateral amygdala, by anticipating and then delineating the schedule and representing reward contingency, provide contextual information that is important for adjusting motivational level as a function of immediate behavior goals.",

         "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation.",

         "Over the past two decades, the role of apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs has become clear. Apoptosis may occur via a death receptor‐dependent (extrinsic) or independent (intrinsic or mitochondrial) pathway. Mitochondria play a central role in cell death in response to DNA damage, and mediate the interaction(s) of various cytoplasmic organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The mitochondrial pathway of cell death is mediated by Bcl‐2 family proteins, a group of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that regulate the passage of small molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis‐inducing factor, which activates caspase cascades, through the mitochondrial transition pore. In addition, apoptosis can induce autophagic cell death via crosstalk between the two pathways upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The current review focused on recent advances surrounding the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by anticancer agents and discussed potential molecular targets for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect(s) of anticancer agents.

         "Phytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in some cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many bacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phytochrome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features of a bonafide phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the chromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXα, which is produced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore was shown to be covalently attached via its A‐ring endo‐vinyl group to a cysteine residue outside the defined bilin lyase domain of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes. Site‐directed mutagenesis identified Cys12 and His247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility, respectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red‐light‐absorbing Pr form and immediately converted into a far‐red‐light‐absorbing Pfr‐enriched form. It shows the characteristic red/far‐red‐light‐induced photoreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that lacks the C15/16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to a 15Z/15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphorylation of PaBphP was demonstrated, confirming its role as a sensor kinase of a bacterial two‐component signaling system.",

         "Two subfamilies of the polar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) located on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis, along with unknown phospholipids, were recently shown to participate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages (Villeneuve, C., G. Etienne, V. Abadie, H. Montrozier, C. Bordier, F. Laval, M. Daffe, I. Maridonneau-Parini, and C. Astarie-Dequeker. 2003.

Biol. Chem. 278: 51291–51300). As demonstrated herein, a phospholipid mixture that derived from the methanol-insoluble fraction inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis. Inhibition was essentially attributable to phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), namely PIM2 and PIM6, because the purified phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were inactive. This was further confirmed using purified PIM2 and PIM6 from M. bovis BCG that decreased by half the internalization of M. smegmatis. Both compounds also inhibited the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium but had no effect on the internalization of zymosan used as a control particle of the phagocytic process. When coated on latex beads, PIM2 and polar GPL (GPL III) favored the particle entry through complement receptor 3. GPL III, but not PIM2, also directed particle entry through the mannose receptor. Therefore, surface-exposed mycobacterial PIM and polar GPL participate in the receptor-dependent internalization of mycobacteria in human macrophages.",

         "Insights from the developing world: thrifty genotypes and thrifty phenotypes",
         "Few researchers would dispute that the pandemic of obesity is caused by a profound mismatch between humanity's present environmental circumstances and those that have moulded evolutionary selection. This concept was first articulated when gestational diabetes was described as being the result of a ‘thrifty genotype rendered detrimental by progress’. More recently, this hypothesis has been extended to the concept of a ‘thrifty phenotype’ to describe the metabolic adaptations adopted as a survival strategy by a malnourished fetus; changes that may also be inappropriate to deal with a later life of affluence. Both the thrifty genotype and the thrifty phenotype hypotheses would predict that populations in some areas of the developing world would be at greater risk of obesity and its co-morbidities; a proposition to be explored in the present paper. To date thrifty genes remain little more than a nebulous concept propagated by the intuitive logic that man has been selected to survive episodic famine and seasonal hungry periods. Under such conditions those individuals who could lay down extra energy stores and use them most efficiently would have a survival advantage. The search for candidate thrifty genes needs to cover every aspect of human energy balance from food-seeking behaviour to the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The present paper will describe examples of attempts to find thrifty genes in three selected candidate areas: maternally-transmitted mitochondrial genes; the uncoupling proteins; apoE4, whose geographical distribution has been linked to a possible thrifty role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.",

         "BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process. First, a BXH-2–specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence–binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-γ in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.",

         "The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression (\"reverse immunology\"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines.

         "BACKGROUND\nElevated concentrations of homocysteine in blood may be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations can be caused by decreased methylation of homocysteine to form methionine, as occurs in folate deficiency. A parallel pathway exists for methylation of homocysteine, in which choline, by way of betaine, is the methyl donor.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to determine whether choline deficiency results in a decreased capacity to methylate homocysteine.\n\n\nDESIGN\nC57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, or 35 mmol choline/kg diet for 3 wk. We then administered an oral methionine load to the animals and measured plasma homocysteine concentrations. Also, in a pilot study, we examined 8 men who were fed a diet providing 550 mg choline/d per 70 kg body weight for 10 d, followed by a diet providing almost no choline, until the subjects were clinically judged to be choline deficient or for <or=42 d. A methionine load was administered at the end of each dietary phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hours after the methionine load, choline-deficient mice had plasma homocysteine concentrations twice those of choline-fed mice. Four hours after the methionine load, clinically choline-depleted men had plasma homocysteine concentrations that were 35% greater than those in men not choline depleted.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that choline, like folate, plays an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine in humans and that response to a methionine load may be useful when assessing choline nutriture.",

To distinguish between fear relevance and time of appearance in evolutionary history, the authors compare phylogenetic and ontogenetic fear-relevant and fear-irrelevant stimuli in a visual search task. The authors found no evidence for a special role of phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli; it seems that fear relevance in general is more important than is the evolutionary age. The pattern of results indicates that attention toward threatening stimuli is mainly affected by a late component that prolongs the disengagement of attention.",

         "We have created a stable transgenic rag2-EGFP-mMyc zebrafish line that develops GFP-labeled T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), allowing visualization of the onset and spread of this disease. Here, we show that leukemias from this transgenic line are highly penetrant and render animals moribund by 80.7 ± 17.6 days of life (±1 SD, range = 50-158 days). These T cell leukemias are clonally aneuploid, can be transplanted into irradiated recipient fish, and express the zebrafish orthologues of the human T-ALL oncogenes tal1/scl and lmo2, thus providing an animal model for the most prevalent molecular subgroup of human T-ALL. Because T-ALL develops very rapidly in rag2-EGFP-mMyc transgenic fish (in which “mMyc” represents mouse c-Myc), this line can only be maintained by in vitro fertilization. Thus, we have created a conditional transgene in which the EGFP-mMyc oncogene is preceded by a loxed dsRED2 gene and have generated stable rag2-loxP-dsRED2-loxP-EGFP-mMyc transgenic zebrafish lines, which have red fluorescent thymocytes and do not develop leukemia. Transgenic progeny from one of these lines can be induced to develop T-ALL by injecting Cre RNA into one-cell-stage embryos, demonstrating the utility of the Cre/lox system in the zebrafish and providing an essential step in preparing this model for chemical and genetic screens designed to identify modifiers of Myc-induced T-ALL.",

         "Neurexins constitute a large family of highly variable cell-surface molecules that may function in synaptic transmission and/or synapse formation. Each of the three known neurexin genes encodes two major neurexin variants, α- and β-neurexins, that are composed of distinct extracellular domains linked to identical intracellular sequences. Deletions of one, two, or all three α-neurexins in mice recently demonstrated their essential role at synapses. In multiple α-neurexin knock-outs, neurotransmitter release from excitatory and inhibitory synapses was severely reduced, primarily probably because voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels were impaired. It remained unclear, however, which neurexin variants actually influence exocytosis and Ca2+ channels, which domain of neurexins is required for this function, and which Ca2+-channel subtypes are regulated. Here, we show by electrophysiological recordings that transgenic neurexin 1α rescues the release and Ca2+-current phenotypes, whereas transgenic neurexin 1β has no effect, indicating the importance of the extracellular sequences for the function of neurexins. Because neurexin 1α rescued the knock-out phenotype independent of the α-neurexin gene deleted, these data are consistent with a redundant function among different α-neurexins. In both knock-out and transgenically rescued mice, α-neurexins selectively affected the component of neurotransmitter release that depended on activation of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, but left L-type Ca2+ channels unscathed. Our findings indicate that α-neurexins represent organizer molecules in neurotransmission that regulate N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, constituting an essential role at synapses that critically involves the extracellular domains of neurexins.",

         "Plants that hyperaccumulate Ni exhibit an exceptional degree of Ni tolerance and the ability to translocate Ni in large amounts from root to shoot. In hyperaccumulator plants in the genus Alyssum, free His is an important Ni binding ligand that increases in the xylem proportionately to root Ni uptake. To determine the molecular basis of the His response and its contribution to Ni tolerance, transcripts representing seven of the eight enzymes involved in His biosynthesis were investigated in the hyperaccumulator species Alyssum lesbiacum by RNA gel blot analysis. None of the transcripts changed in abundance in either root or shoot tissue when plants were exposed to Ni, but transcript levels were constitutively higher in A. lesbiacum than in the congeneric nonaccumulator A. montanum, especially for the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyltransferase (ATP-PRT). Comparison with the weak hyperaccumulator A. serpyllifolium revealed a close correlation between Ni tolerance, root His concentration, and ATP-PRT transcript abundance. Overexpression of an A. lesbiacum ATP-PRT cDNA in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana increased the pool of free His up to 15-fold in shoot tissue, without affecting the concentration of any other amino acid. His-overproducing lines also displayed elevated tolerance to Ni but did not exhibit increased Ni concentrations in either xylem sap or shoot tissue, suggesting that additional factors are necessary to recapitulate the complete hyperaccumulator phenotype. These results suggest that ATP-PRT expression plays a major role in regulating the pool of free His and contributes to the exceptional Ni tolerance of hyperaccumulator Alyssum species.",

         "The stringent starvation protein A (SspA) is a RNA polymerase‐associated protein and is required for transcriptional activation of bacteriophage P1 late promoters. However, the role of SspA in gene expression in Escherichia coli is essentially unknown. In this work, we show that SspA is essential for cell survival during acid‐induced stress. Apparently, SspA inhibits stationary‐phase accumulation of H‐NS, a global regulator which functions mostly as a repressor, thereby derepressing multiple stress defence systems including those for acid stress and nutrient starvation. Consequently, the gene expression pattern of the H‐NS regulon  is  altered  in  the  sspA mutant,  leading  to acid‐sensitive and hypermotile phenotypes. Thus, our study indicates that SspA is a global regulator, which acts upstream of H‐NS, and thereby plays an important role in the stress response of E. coli during stationary phase. In addition, our results indicate that the expression of the H‐NS regulon is sensitive to small changes in the cellular level of H‐NS, enabling the cell to response rapidly to environment cues. As SspA and H‐NS are highly conserved among Gram‐negative bacteria, of which many are pathogenic, the global role of SspA in the stress response and pathogenesis is discussed.",

         "All germ cells throughout the animal kingdom contain cytoplasmic cloud-like accumulations of material called nuage. Polar bodies in Drosophila oocytes are probably the best known forms of nuage. In spermatogenic cells, the nuage is called chromatoid body (CB). In early spermatids of the rat, it has a diameter of 1-1.5 microm and a finely filamentous lobular structure. Typically, it is associated with a multitude of vesicles. It is first clearly seen in mid- and late pachytene spermatocytes as an intermitochondrial dense material. During early spermiogenesis it is seen near the Golgi complex and frequently connected by material continuities through nuclear pore complexes with intranuclear particles. In living cells, the CB moves around the Golgi complex and has frequent contacts with it. The CB also moves perpendicularly to the nuclear envelope, and even through cytoplasmic bridges to the neighbour spermatids. One of the major components of the CB is a DEAD-box RNA helicase VASA that belongs to a class of proteins thought to act as RNA chaperones. It is a general marker of all germ cells and best characterized in Drosophila. The mouse VASA homologue was recently used as a marker of sperm formation from embryonic stem cells. It becomes generally accepted that the CB with its associated structures constitute a mechanism of post-transcriptional processing and storage of several mRNA species that are shared between neighbour cells and used for translation when the genome of the spermatids becomes inactive.",

         "The increasing photorealism for computer graphics has made computer graphics a convincing form of image forgery. Therefore, classifying photographic images and photorealistic computer graphics has become an important problem for image forgery detection. In this paper, we propose a new geometry-based image model, motivated by the physical image generation process, to tackle the above-mentioned problem. The proposed model reveals certain physical differences between the two image categories, such as the gamma correction in photographic images and the sharp structures in computer graphics. For the problem of image forgery detection, we propose two levels of image authenticity definition, i.e., imaging-process authenticity and scene authenticity, and analyze our technique against these definitions. Such definition is important for making the concept of image authenticity computable. Apart from offering physical insights, our technique with a classification accuracy of 83.5% outperforms those in the prior work, i.e., wavelet features at 80.3% and cartoon features at 71.0%. We also consider a recapturing attack scenario and propose a counter-attack measure. In addition, we constructed a publicly available benchmark dataset with images of diverse content and computer graphics of high photorealism.",

         "SUMMARY We have explored the molecular basis for differences in physiological function between the gills and opercular epithelium of the euryhaline killifish Fundulus heteroclitus. These tissues are functionally similar in seawater, but in freshwater the gills actively absorb Na+ but not Cl–, whereas the opercular epithelium actively absorbs Cl– but not Na+. These differences in freshwater physiology are likely due to differences in absolute levels of gene expression (measured using real-time PCR), as several proteins important for Na+ transport, namely Na+,H+-exchanger 2 (NHE2), carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2), Na+,HCO3–cotransporter 1, and V-type H+-ATPase, were expressed at 3- to over 30-fold higher absolute levels in the gills. In gills, transfer from 10% seawater to freshwater increased the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase by twofold (from 12 h to 7 days), increased the expression of NHE2 (at 12 h) and CA2 (from 12 h to 7 days), and decreased the expression of NHE3 (from 12 h to 3 days). In opercular epithelium, NHE2 was not expressed; furthermore, Na+,K+-ATPase activity was unchanged after transfer to freshwater, CA2 mRNA levels decreased, and NHE3 levels increased. Consistent with their functional similarities in seawater, killifish gills and opercular epithelium expressed Na+,K+-ATPase α1a, Na+,K+,2Cl–cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl– channel and the signalling protein 14-3-3a at similar absolute levels. Furthermore, NKCC1 and CFTR were suppressed equally in each tissue after freshwater transfer, and 14-3-3a mRNA increased in both. These results provide insight into the mechanisms of ion transport by killifish gills and opercular epithelia, and demonstrate a potential molecular basis for the differences in physiological function between these two organs.",

         "Human organic anion transporter 2 (hOat2 [SLC22A7]) is highly expressed in the human liver. Although localization, gene expression, substrate specificity and transport mechanisms of other human Oat isoforms such as human Oat1 (hOat1), human Oat3 (hOat3) and human Oat4 (hOat4) have been elucidated, information concerning human Oat2 (hOat2) is less defined. The objective of this study was to provide further information on the transport mechanism and substrate specificity of hOat2. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the transport of organic compounds mediated by hOat2 was not affected by the replacement of extracellular sodium with lithium, choline and mannitol. The uptake of estrone sulfate (ES) in hOat2‐expressing oocytes was significantly trans‐stimulated by preloading the oocytes with fumarate and succinate, but not glutarate. Moreover, we observed that hOat2 mediates the transport of bumetanide, ES, glutarate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, allopurinol, prostaglandin E2, 5‐fluorouracil, paclitaxel and L‐ascorbic acid. These compounds are identified for the first time as hOat2 substrates. A wide range of structurally unrelated organic compounds inhibited the hOat2‐mediated uptake of tetracycline, except for sulfobromophthalein. All of these findings indicate that hOat2 is a sodium‐independent multi‐specific organic anion/dimethyldicarboxylate exchanger. Our present findings thus provide further insights into the role of hOat2 in hepatic drug transport.",

         "DNA damage activates the monoubiquitination of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein, FANCD2, resulting in the assembly of FANCD2 nuclear foci. In the current study, we characterize structural features of FANCD2 required for this intranuclear translocation. We have previously identified 2 normal mRNA splice variants of FANCD2, one containing exon 44 sequence at the 3' end (FANCD2-44) and one containing exon 43 sequence (FANCD2-43). The 2 predicted FANCD2 proteins differ in their carboxy terminal 24 amino acids. In stably transfected FANCD2(-/-) fibroblasts, FANCD2-44 and FANCD2-43 proteins were monoubiquitinated on K561. Only FANCD2-44 corrected the mitomycin C (MMC) sensitivity of the transfected cells. We find that monoubiquitinated FANCD2-44 was translocated from the soluble nuclear compartment into chromatin. A mutant form of FANCD2-44 (FANCD2-K561R) was not monoubiquitinated and failed to bind chromatin. A truncated FANCD2 protein (Exon44-T), lacking the carboxy terminal 24 amino acids encoded by exon 44 but retaining K561, and another mutant FANCD2 protein, with a single amino acid substitution at a conserved residue within the C-terminal 24 amino acids (D1428A), were monoubiquitinated. Both mutants were targeted to chromatin but failed to correct MMC sensitivity. Taken together, our results indicate that monoubiquitination of FANCD2 regulates chromatin binding and that D1428 within the carboxy terminal acidic sequence encoded by exon 44 is independently required for functional complementation of FA-D2 cells. We hypothesize that the carboxy terminus of FANCD2-44 plays a critical role in sensing or repairing DNA damage.",

One factor not explicitly addressed in their meta-analysis is the actual estimation of genome-wide heterozygosity via molecular markers. Many authors still associate marker-estimated heterozygosity with genome-wide heterozygosity, despite allozyme-based evidence that such correlations are usually very weak or nonexistent. Here, we show that genome-wide heterozygosity is poorly estimated not only by allozymes but also by microsatellite loci and by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thus, associations between fitness (or other phenotypes) and heterozygosity should be established firmly on causative factors and not on simple correlations.",

         "Tip growth in neuronal cells, plant cells, and fungal hyphae is known to require tip-localized Rho GTPase, calcium, and filamentous actin (F-actin), but how they interact with each other is unclear. The pollen tube is an exciting model to study spatiotemporal regulation of tip growth and F-actin dynamics. An Arabidopsis thaliana Rho family GTPase, ROP1, controls pollen tube growth by regulating apical F-actin dynamics. This paper shows that ROP1 activates two counteracting pathways involving the direct targets of tip-localized ROP1: RIC3 and RIC4. RIC4 promotes F-actin assembly, whereas RIC3 activates Ca2+ signaling that leads to F-actin disassembly. Overproduction or depletion of either RIC4 or RIC3 causes tip growth defects that are rescued by overproduction or depletion of RIC3 or RIC4, respectively. Thus, ROP1 controls actin dynamics and tip growth through a check and balance between the two pathways. The dual and antagonistic roles of this GTPase may provide a unifying mechanism by which Rho modulates various processes dependent on actin dynamics in eukaryotic cells.",

Results: Hierarchical clustering revealed a distinct separation of the melanoma samples from the benign and normal specimens. Novel genes associated with malignant melanoma were identified. Differential gene expression of two melanoma-specific genes, PLAB and L1CAM, were tested by a one-step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay on primary malignant melanoma, benign nevi, and normal skin samples, as well as on malignant melanoma lymph node metastasis and melanoma-free lymph nodes. The performance of the markers was compared with conventional melanoma markers such as tyrosinase, gp100, and MART1.

         "Expression of Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin Regulates Epithelial Morphogenesis in Vitro*",
         "Growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are highly up-regulated during development and following renal injury and are known to induce marked morphogenic actions in cultured tubular epithelial cells, including scattering, migration, single cell branching morphogenesis, and multicellular branching tubulogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that HGF stimulates epithelial cells to express neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal), a member of the lipocalin family of secreted proteins that has recently been shown to participate in mesenchymal-epithelial transformation via its ability to augment cellular iron uptake. At concentrations below those found to mediate iron transport, purified Ngal can induce a promigratory and probranching effect that is dependent on ERK activation. The suppression of Ngal expression using short hairpin RNA results in increased cyst formation by tubular cells. However, the simultaneous addition of Ngal and HGF leads to direct association of the two proteins, and results in a partial inhibition of HGF-mediated activation of c-Met and the downstream MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways. This inhibitory effect down-regulates HGF-stimulated single cell migration, and limits branching morphogenesis at both the single cell and multicellular level. These experiments demonstrate that the local expression of Ngal can play a regulatory role in epithelial morphogenesis by promoting the organization of cells into tubular structures while simultaneously negatively modulating the branching effects of HGF.",

         "Bax and Bak are required for apoptosis induction by sulforaphane, a cruciferous vegetable-derived cancer chemopreventive agent.",
         "Sulforaphane, a constituent of many edible cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, effectively suppresses proliferation of cancer cells in culture and in vivo by causing apoptosis induction, but the sequence of events leading to cell death is poorly defined. Here, we show that multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak play a critical role in apoptosis induction by sulforaphane. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (a) sulforaphane treatment caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the protein levels of both Bax and Bak and conformational change and mitochondrial translocation of Bax in SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from wild-type mice to trigger cytosolic release of apoptogenic molecules (cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and ultimately cell death; (b) MEFs derived from Bax or Bak knockout mice resisted cell death by sulforaphane, and (c) MEFs derived from Bax and Bak double knockout mice exhibited even greater protection against sulforaphane-induced cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis compared with wild-type or single knockout cells. Interestingly, sulforaphane treatment also caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the protein level of Apaf-1 in wild-type, Bax-/-, and Bak-/- MEFs but not in double knockout, suggesting that Bax and Bak might regulate sulforaphane-mediated induction of Apaf-1 protein. A marked decline in the protein level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis on treatment with sulforaphane was also observed. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that sulforaphane-induced apoptosis is amplified by a decrease in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis level, which functions to block cell death by inhibiting activities of caspases. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that Bax and Bak proteins play a critical role in initiation of cell death by sulforaphane.",

         "The waddles (wdl) mouse is a unique animal model that exhibits ataxia and appendicular dystonia without pathological abnormalities of either the central or the peripheral nervous systems. A 19-bp deletion in exon 8 of the carbonic anhydrase-related protein VIII gene (Car8) was detected by high-throughput temperature-gradient capillary electrophoresis heteroduplex analysis of PCR amplicons of genes and ESTs within the wdl locus on mouse chromosome 4. Although regarded as a member of the carbonic anhydrase gene family, the encoded protein (CAR8) has no reported enzymatic activity. In normal mice, CAR8 is abundantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells as well as in several other cell groups. Compatible with nonsense-mediated decay of mutant transcripts, CAR8 is virtually absent in mice homozygous for the wdl mutation. These data indicate that the wdl mouse is a Car8 null mutant and that CAR8 plays a central role in motor control.",

         "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. In virtually all SMA patients, a nearly identical copy gene is present, SMN2. SMN2 cannot fully compensate for the loss of SMN1 because the majority of transcripts derived from SMN2 lack a critical exon (exon 7), resulting in a dysfunctional SMN protein. Therefore, the critical distinction between a functional and a dysfunctional SMN protein is the inclusion or the exclusion of the exon 7 encoded peptide. To determine the role of the 16 amino acids encoded by SMN exon 7, a panel of synthetic mutations were transiently expressed in SMA patient fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Consistent with previous reports, the protein encoded by SMN exons 1-6 was primarily restricted to the nucleus. However, a variety of heterologous sequences fused to the C-terminus of SMN exons 1-6 allowed mutant SMN proteins to properly distribute to the cytoplasm and to the nuclear gems. These data demonstrate that the SMN exon 7 sequence is not specifically required, rather this region functions as a non-specific 'tail' that facilitates proper localization. Therefore, a possible means to restore additional activity to the SMNDelta7 protein could be to induce a longer C-terminus by suppressing recognition of the native stop codon. To address this possibility, aminoglycosides were examined for their ability to restore detectable levels of SMN protein in SMA patient fibroblasts. Aminoglycosides can suppress the accurate identification of translation termination codons in eukaryotic cells. Consistent with this, treatment of SMA patient fibroblasts with tobramycin and amikacin resulted in a quantitative increase in SMN-positive gems and an overall increase in detectable SMN protein. Taken together, this work describes the role of the critical exon 7 region and identifies a possible alternative approach for therapeutic intervention.",

         "Normal human melanocyte homeostasis as a paradigm for understanding melanoma.",
         "Melanocytes, after cell division, separate and migrate along the basement membrane; they extend their dendrites and establish multiple contacts with keratinocytes. Once adhesion is established, keratinocytes control melanocyte growth and expression of cell surface receptors. Most melanomas arise within the epidermis (melanoma in situ) and then invade across the basement membrane. These melanoma cells escape from control by keratinocytes through five major mechanisms: (1) downregulation of receptors important for communication with keratinocytes such as E-cadherin, P-cadherin, and desmoglein, which is achieved through growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and endothelin-1 produced by fibroblasts or keratinocytes; (2) upregulation of receptors and signaling molecules important for melanoma cell-melanoma cell and melanoma cell-fibroblast interactions such as N-cadherin, Mel-CAM, and zonula occludens protein-1; (3) deregulation of morphogens such as Notch receptors and their ligands; (4) loss of anchorage to the basement membrane because of an altered expression of cell-matrix adhesion molecules; (5) increased elaboration of metal-loproteinases. Thus, investigating normal melanocyte homeostasis helps us to better define how melanoma cells escape the microenvironment created by epidermal keratinocytes and how they develop new cellular partners in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which support their growth and invasion.",

         "Gliomas represent the most frequent type of human brain tumor, and their strong invasiveness is a significant clinical problem. Microglia, the immunocompetent cells of the brain, contribute significantly to the tumor and are potential interaction partners of the glioma cells. We studied the impact of the presence of microglia on tumor cell invasion in cultured brain slices. To selectively deplete microglia, the slices were treated with clodronate-filled liposomes. When glioma cells were injected into slices devoid of endogenous microglia, the invasiveness of the tumors was significantly decreased as compared with controls. Inoculation of exogenous microglia together with glioma cells into cultured brain slices increased the infiltrative behavior of the tumor depending on the microglia/glioma cell ratio. Cell culture experiments revealed that soluble factors released from glioma cells strongly stimulate metalloprotease-2 activity in microglia. In the brain slices inoculated with glioma cells, increased activity of metalloprotease-2 was directly correlated with the abundance of microglia. Our data indicate that glioma cells stimulate microglial cells to increase breakdown of extracellular matrix and thereby promote tumor invasiveness.",

         "Cryptochromes (CRY) are blue light photoreceptors that mediate various light-induced responses in plants and animals. Arabidopsis CRY (CRY1 and CRY2) functions through negatively regulating constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) 1, a repressor of photomorphogenesis. Water evaporation and photosynthesis are regulated by the stomatal pores in plants, which are closed in darkness but open in response to blue light. There is evidence only for the phototropin blue light receptors (PHOT1 and PHOT2) in mediating blue light regulation of stomatal opening. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized role for Arabidopsis CRY and COP1 in the regulation of stomatal opening. Stomata of the cry1 cry2 double mutant showed reduced blue light response, whereas those of the CRY1-overexpressing plants showed hypersensitive response to blue light. In addition, stomata of the phot1 phot2 double mutant responded to blue light, but those of the cry1 cry2 phot1 phot2 quadruple mutant hardly responded. Strikingly, stomata of the cop1 mutant were constitutively open in darkness and stomata of the cry1 cry2 cop1 and phot1 phot2 cop1 triple mutants were open as wide as those of the cop1 single mutant under blue light. These results indicate that CRY functions additively with PHOT in mediating blue light-induced stomatal opening and that COP1 is a repressor of stomatal opening and likely acts downstream of CRY and PHOT signaling pathways.",

         "We previously reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165 inflammatory effect is mediated by acute platelet-activating factor synthesis from endothelial cells upon the activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and its coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In addition, VEGF-A165 promotes the release of other endothelial mediators including nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI2). However, it is unknown whether VEGF-A165 is mediating PGI2 synthesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and/or VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation and whether the coreceptor NRP-1 potentiates VEGF-A165 activity. In this study, PGI2 synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was assessed by quantifying its stable metabolite (6-keto prostaglandin F1α, 6-keto PGF1α) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment of BAEC with VEGF analogs, VEGF-A165 (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 agonist) and VEGF-A121 (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonist) (up to 10–9 m), increased PGI2 synthesis by 70- and 40-fold within 15 min. Treatment with VEGFR-1 (placental growth factor and VEGF-B) or VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C) agonist did not increase PGI2 synthesis. The combination of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonists did not increase PGI2 release. Pretreatment with a VEGFR-2 inhibitor abrogated PGI2 release mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121, and pretreatment of BAEC with antisense oligomers targeting VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 mRNA reduced PGI2 synthesis mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121 up to 79%. In summary, our data demonstrate that the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 heterodimer (VEGFR-1/R-2) is essential for PGI2 synthesis mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121, which cannot be reproduced by the parallel activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 homodimers with corresponding agonists. In addition, the binding of VEGF-A165 to NRP-1 potentiates its capacity to promote PGI2 synthesis.",

         "CD46 Is a Cellular Receptor for All Species B Adenoviruses except Types 3 and 7",
         "ABSTRACT The 51 human adenovirus serotypes are divided into six species (A to F). Adenovirus serotypes from all species except species B utilize the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor for attachment to host cells in vitro. Species B adenoviruses primarily cause ocular and respiratory tract infections, but certain serotypes are also associated with renal disease. We have previously demonstrated that adenovirus type 11 (species B) uses CD46 (membrane cofactor protein) as a cellular receptor instead of the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (A. Segerman et al., J. Virol. 77:9183-9191, 2003). In the present study, we found that transfection with human CD46 cDNA rendered poorly permissive Chinese hamster ovary cells more permissive to infection by all species B adenovirus serotypes except adenovirus types 3 and 7. Moreover, rabbit antiserum against human CD46 blocked or efficiently inhibited all species B serotypes except adenovirus types 3 and 7 from infecting human A549 cells. We also sequenced the gene encoding the fiber protein of adenovirus type 50 (species B) and compared it with the corresponding amino acid sequences from selected serotypes, including all other serotypes of species B. From the results obtained, we conclude that CD46 is a major cellular receptor on A549 cells for all species B adenoviruses except types 3 and 7.",

         "Drosophila Wingless (Wg) is the founding member of the Wnt family of secreted proteins. During the wing development, Wg acts as a morphogen whose concentration gradient provides positional cues for wing patterning. The molecular mechanism(s) of Wg gradient formation is not fully understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the roles of glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein (Dlp), the Wg receptors Frizzled (Fz) and Fz2, and the Wg co-receptor Arrow (Arr) in Wg gradient formation in the wing disc. We demonstrate that both Dally and Dlp are essential and have different roles in Wg gradient formation. The specificities of Dally and Dlp in Wg gradient formation are at least partially achieved by their distinct expression patterns. To our surprise, although Fz2 was suggested to play an essential role in Wg gradient formation by ectopic expression studies, removal of Fz2 activity does not alter the extracellular Wg gradient. Interestingly, removal of both Fz and Fz2, or Arr causes enhanced extracellular Wg levels, which is mainly resulted from upregulated Dlp levels. We further show that Notum, a negative regulator of Wg signaling, downregulates Wg signaling mainly by modifying Dally. Last, we demonstrate that Wg movement is impeded by cells mutant for both dally and dlp. Together, these new findings suggest that the Wg morphogen gradient in the wing disc is mainly controlled by combined actions of Dally and Dlp. We propose that Wg establishes its concentration gradient by a restricted diffusion mechanism involving Dally and Dlp in the wing disc.",

         "Ozone (O3), a major photochemical oxidant, induces leaf injury concomitant with salicylic acid (SA) synthesis. In pathogen-infected leaves, SA is synthesized via two pathways, involving phenylalanine or isochorismate. SA biosynthesis under O3 fumigation is not well understood. When we applied 14C-labeled benzoic acid (a precursor of SA in the pathway via phenylalanine) to O3-exposed tobacco leaves, it was effectively metabolized to SA. However, the activity and mRNA level of isochorismate synthase (ICS) were not increased. In contrast, ICS activity was increased in O3-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana L. These results suggest that SA is synthesized via benzoic acid from phenylalanine in O3-exposed tobacco leaves but via isochorismate in Arabidopsis. Ethylene is a plant hormone that promotes leaf damage in O3-exposed plants. During O3 exposure, transgenic plants with a phenotype of reduced O3-induced ethylene production accumulated less SA than did wild-type plants. O3 increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and the transcript levels of the chorismate mutase (CM) and PAL genes in wild-type tobacco, but their induction was suppressed in the transgenic plants. These results indicate that ethylene promotes SA accumulation by regulating the expression of the CM and PAL genes in O3-exposed tobacco.",

         "Purpose: Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, the growth regulatory mechanisms of which are unknown. We investigated the involvement of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals in synovial sarcoma and evaluated the therapeutic effect of inhibiting the FGF signal. Experimental Design: The expression of 22 FGF and 4 FGF receptor (FGFR) genes in 18 primary tumors and five cell lines of synovial sarcoma were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Effects of recombinant FGF2, FGF8, and FGF18 for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the growth of synovial sarcoma cell lines were analyzed. Growth inhibitory effects of FGFR inhibitors on synovial sarcoma cell lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results: Synovial sarcoma cell lines expressed multiple FGF genes especially those expressed in neural tissues, among which FGF8 showed growth stimulatory effects in all synovial sarcoma cell lines. FGF signals in synovial sarcoma induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38MAPK but not c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Disruption of the FGF signaling pathway in synovial sarcoma by specific inhibitors of FGFR caused cell cycle arrest leading to significant growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition by the FGFR inhibitor was associated with a down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 but not p38MAPK, and an ERK kinase inhibitor also showed growth inhibitory effects for synovial sarcoma, indicating that the growth stimulatory effect of FGF was transmitted through the ERK1/2. Conclusions: FGF signals have an important role in the growth of synovial sarcoma, and inhibitory molecules will be of potential use for molecular target therapy in synovial sarcoma.",

         "This study was designed to investigate the effects of the aqueous ethanol extract of Astragalus membranaceus BUNGE (Leguminosae) on rat thoracic aorta. Isometric tension was recorded in response to drugs in organ bath. In endothelium-intact aortic rings, A. membranaceus extract induced a significant dose-dependent relaxation of the rings precontracted by phenylephrine, which could be inhibited by preincubation with L-N(omega)-nitro-arginine methyl ester or methylthioninium chloride. In endothelium-denuded ones, the extract could dose-dependently relax the rings contracted by phenylephrine, not by KCl; and it could also attenuate contractile response to phenylephrine, not to caffeine or phorbol-12,13-diacetate in Ca(2+)-free medium; but it failed to affect the CaCl(2)-induced enhancement of contractile response to phenylephrine in Ca(2+)-free medium. These results indicate that nitric oxide signaling and Ca(2+)-handling pathway are involved in the A. membranaceus extract-induced vasodilatation.",

         "Critical roles of CD146 in zebrafish vascular development",
         "In this report, we use zebrafish as a model system to understand the importance of CD146 in vascular development. Endothelial‐specific expression of CD146 was verified by whole‐mount in situ hybridization. Suppression of CD146 protein expression by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) resulted in poorly developed intersomitic vessels (ISVs). In CD146 morphants, we observed a lack of blood flow through the ISV region, despite that fluorescence microangiography showed that the ISVs were present. This finding suggests that the lumens of the developing ISVs may be too narrow for proper circulation. Additionally, remodeling of the caudal vein plexus into functional vascular tubes appeared to be affected. Suppression of CD146 protein expression resulted in a circulation shunt that caused the circulation to by‐pass part of the caudal artery/vein system. The same vascular defects were recapitulated by using a second morpholino oligonucleotide. This morphant expressed a truncated CD146 protein with amino acids V32 to T57 at the N terminus deleted in an in‐frame manner. This region, therefore, is likely to contain elements critical for CD146 function. This study provides the first in vivo functional assessment of CD146 in embryonic development by showing that knockdown of CD146 protein expression severely hinders vascular development in zebrafish.

         "Differential Contribution of Troponin I Phosphorylation Sites to the Endothelin-modulated Contractile Response*",
         "Cardiac troponin I is a phosphorylation target for endothelin-activated protein kinase C. Earlier work in cardiac myocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I provided evidence that protein kinase C-mediated cardiac troponin I phosphorylation accelerates relaxation. However, replacement with the slow skeletal isoform also alters the myofilament pH response and the Ca2+ transient, which could influence endothelin-mediated relaxation. Here, differences in the Ca2+ transient could not explain the divergent relaxation response to endothelin in myocytes expressing cardiac versus slow skeletal troponin I nor could activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Three separate clusters within cardiac troponin I are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and we set out to determine the contribution of the Thr144 and Ser23/Ser24 clusters to the endothelin-mediated contractile response. Myocyte replacement with a cardiac troponin I containing a Thr144 substituted with the Pro residue found in slow skeletal troponin I resulted in prolonged relaxation in response to acute endothelin compared with control myocytes. Ser23/Ser24 also is a target for protein kinase C phosphorylation of purified cardiac troponin I, and although this cluster was not acutely phosphorylated in intact myocytes, significant phosphorylation developed within 1 h after adding endothelin. Replacement of Ser23/Ser24 with Ala indicated that this cluster contributes significantly to relaxation during more prolonged endothelin stimulation. Overall, results with these mutants provide evidence that Thr144 plays an important role in the acute acceleration of relaxation, whereas Ser23/Ser24 contributes to relaxation during more prolonged activation of protein kinase C by endothelin.",

         "This paper documents a study, carried out in the academic year 2003-2004, on fifteen factors that may influence performance on a first year object-oriented programming module. The factors included prior academic experience, prior computer experience, self-perception of programming performance and comfort level on the module and specific cognitive skills. The study found that a student's perception of their understanding of the module had the strongest correlation with programming performance, r=0.76, p‹0.01. In addition, Leaving Certificate (LC) mathematics and science scores were shown to have a strong correlation with performance. A regression module, based upon a student's perception of their understanding of the module, gender, LC mathematics score and comfort level was able to account for 79% of the variance in programming performance results.",

         "Objective—The high and low responder phenomenon describes individual differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) activity. We characterized patterns of intracellular accumulation, externalization, and shedding of TF in response to LPS in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). Methods and Results—After 2 hours of LPS stimulation of whole blood, flow cytometry analyses revealed a larger population of TF-positive monocytes in HRs (32.0±3.5%) versus LRs (11.2±1.2%; P≤0.05), along with a stronger mean fluorescence intensity of TF signal in HRs (7.1±0.5 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with LRs (5.4±0.4 AU; P≤0.05). The LPS-treated blood of the HR group contained 2-fold more TF-positive microparticles than LRs. In-cell Western assay demonstrated higher intracellular accumulation of TF in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from LRs because LPS induced a 3.7-fold increase of total TF levels in LRs versus a 1.5-fold increase in HRs. In contrast, in response to LPS stimulation, MNCs from HRs exhibited a 4-fold induction of surface TF, whereas MNCs from LRs only had a minor increase in surface TF levels. Conclusions—The higher availability of surface TF antigen on MNCs from HRs and TF-containing microparticles might make these individuals more susceptible to hypercoagulation.",

         "Cbl proteins have been implicated in ligand-induced TCR/CD3 down-modulation, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed the effect of mutation of a cbl-binding site on ZAP-70 (ZAP-Y292F) on dynamics, internalization, and degradation of the TCR/CD3 complex in response to distinct stimuli. Naive CD8 T cells expressing the P14 transgenic TCR from ZAP-Y292F mice were selectively affected in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to antigenic stimulation, whereas neither anti-CD3 Ab-, and PMA-induced TCR down-modulation, nor constitutive receptor endocytosis/cycling were impaired. We further established that the defect in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to Ag was paralleled by an impaired TCR/CD3 internalization and CD3ζ degradation. Analysis of T/APC conjugates revealed that delayed redistribution of TCR at the T/APC contact zone was paralleled by a delay in TCR internalization in the synaptic zone in ZAP-Y292F compared with ZAP-wild-type T cells. Cbl recruitment to the synapse was also retarded in ZAP-Y292F T cells, although F-actin and LFA-1 redistribution was similar for both cell types. This study identifies a step involving ZAP-70/cbl interaction that is critical for rapid internalization of the TCR/CD3 complex at the CD8 T cell/APC synapse.",

         "In this work we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn the CPU time-slice utilization behavior of known programs in a Linux system. Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The \"Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis\" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C'4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution. We find our result interesting in the context that generally operating systems presently never make use of a program's previous execution history in their scheduling behavior.",

Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a new member of the NLRR family, NLRR4, and its potential role in long-lasting memory. We generated NLRR4-deficient (NLRR4−/−) mice and found that they showed impaired memory retention. In hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, NLRR4−/− mice were able to learn and maintain the memories for one day but unable to retain the memories for four days after learning. In contrast, in a hippocampus-independent task, NLRR4−/− mice were able to retain the memory normally for at least seven days. These results suggest that NLRR4 plays a key role in hippocampus-dependent long-lasting memory.",

         "We present an encoding framework which exploits semantics for video content delivery. The video content is organized based on the idea of main content message. In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.",

         "ABSTRACT Of the nasopharyngeal cultures recovered from 942 day care center (DCC) attendees in Lisbon, Portugal, 591 (62%) yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae during a surveillance performed in February and March of 1999. Forty percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. In particular, 2% were penicillin resistant and 20% had intermediate penicillin resistance. Multidrug resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracycline was the most frequent antibiotype (17% of all isolates). Serotyping and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were performed for 202 out of 237 drug-resistant pneumococci (DRPn). The most frequent serotypes were 6B (26%), 14 (22%), 19F (16%), 23F (10%), and nontypeable (12%). The majority (67%) of the DRPn strains were representatives of nine international clones included in the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network; eight of them had been detected in previous studies. Fourteen novel clones were identified, corresponding to 26% of the DRPn strains. The remaining 7% of the strains were local clones detected in our previous studies. Comparison with studies conducted since 1996 in Portuguese DCCs identified several trends: (i) the rate of DRPn frequency has fluctuated between 40 and 50%; (ii) the serotypes most frequently recovered have remained the same; (iii) nontypeable strains appear to be increasing in frequency; and (iv) a clone of serotype 33F emerged in 1999. Together, our observations highlight that the nasopharynxes of children in DCCs are a melting pot of successful DRPn clones that are important to study and monitor if we aim to gain a better understanding on the epidemiology of this pathogen.",

         "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

         "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of mortality accounting for approximately 10% of all deaths from malignancy in the western world. Polymorphism in the glutathione S-transferase GSTT1 gene has been associated with CRC risk in some but not all studies. In this study, we examined associations between GSTT1 genotypes and CRC risk, and prognosis in 361 cases and 881 unrelated controls. GSTT1 null was associated with a small but significant increase in risk (P = 0.0006, odds ratio (OR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-2.24). GSTT1 null was also associated with a significantly younger age at diagnosis (mean 65.2 years) compared with GSTT1 A (mean 67.6 years, P = 0.031). There were no significant associations between GSTT1 genotypes and clinical factors (e.g. Dukes stage, differentiation and tumour node metastasis classification) in the total case group. However, following stratification by age (<70 versus > or =70 years at diagnosis), in the patients diagnosed <70 years of age, GSTT1 null was more common in Dukes grade A/B tumours (P = 0.046), stage T1/T2 tumours (P = 0.053) and those with a pushing margin (P = 0.066). We also identified associations between GSTT1 null and increased prevalence of host lymphocyte response, particularly in the younger patients (P = 0.036). Furthermore, GSTT1 null was associated with improved survival in younger patients (P = 0.017, hazards ratio (HR) = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.31-0.89) but poorer survival in older patients (P = 0.017, HR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.12-3.20). We proposed a model based on the dual functionality of GSTT1 to explain these contrasting results. We suggest that the null genotype is associated with improved immune response in younger patients, but poorer detoxification in older patients. These findings may also provide an explanation for the contrasting finding of other studies on the role of this gene in CRC.",

         "In eukaryotic cellular proteins, protein N‐myristoylation has been recognized as a protein modification that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic proteins. In this study, to search for a eukaryotic N‐myristoylated transmembrane protein, the susceptibility of the N‐terminus of several G‐protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) to protein N‐myristoylation was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling. It was found that the N‐terminal 10 residues of B96Bom, a Bombyx mori GPCR, efficiently directed the protein N‐myristoylation. Analysis of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) fusion protein with the N‐terminal 90 residues of B96Bom at its N‐terminus revealed that (a) transmembrane domain 1 of B96Bom functioned as a type I signal anchor sequence, (b) the N‐myristoylated N‐terminal domain (58 residues) was translocated across the membrane, and (c) two N‐glycosylation motifs located in this domain were efficiently N‐glycosylated. In addition, when Ala4 in the N‐myristoylation motif of B96Bom90‐TNF, Met‐Gly‐Gln‐Ala‐Ala‐Thr(1–6), was replaced with Asn to generate a new N‐glycosylation motif, Asn‐Ala‐Thr(4–6), efficient N‐glycosylation was observed on this newly introduced N‐glycosylation site in the expressed protein. These results indicate that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of B96Bom is translocated across the membrane and exposed to the extracellular surface. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a eukaryotic transmembrane protein can be N‐myristoylated and that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of the protein can be translocated across the membrane.",

         "Tissue remodelling is dependent on the integration of signals that control turnover of ECM (extracellular matrix). Breakdown and endocytosis of collagen, a major component of the ECM, is central to this process. Whereas controlled secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes (such as matrix metalloproteinases) has long been known to mediate ECM breakdown, it is becoming clear that uPARAP/Endo180 (where uPARAP stands for urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein) serves as a receptor that mediates endocytosis of collagen by several types of cells. In the liver, the stellate cells play a major role in turnover of ECM including collagens. These cells synthesize various collagens and also produce matrix metalloproteinases. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of rat hepatic stellate cells to endocytose and degrade 125I-labelled heat-denatured collagen I. It was found that the collagen is efficiently taken up and degraded by these cells. Degradation was inhibited by inhibitors of lysosomal proteases (leupeptin and E-64d) and the vacuolar proton pump (concanamycin A), indicating that it takes place in lysosomes. Furthermore, endocytosed FITC-labelled collagen was shown to reach late endocytic compartments in which it colocalized with LysoTracker (a marker of late endocytic compartments). Competition experiments showed that uPA and unlabelled collagen are capable of inhibiting binding and uptake of [125I]collagen in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Western-blot analysis of cell lysate (using a polyclonal rabbit human-Endo180 antiserum) revealed a single band at 180 kDa. In addition, the antiserum was capable of reducing [125I]collagen binding to the cell surface. Finally, using two primers designed from the human uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA sequence, the expression of uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR. These results together suggest that uPARAP/Endo180 mediates endocytosis of collagen in rat liver stellate cells.",

         "Abstract Laboratory natural selection and artificial selection are vital tools for addressing specific questions about evolutionary patterns of variation. Laboratory natural selection can illuminate whether a putative selective agent is capable of generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits and the extent to which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss theoretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken beyond model organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation.",

         "The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events. We recorded neurons from the basolateral complex of two monkeys while they performed visually cued schedules of sequential color discrimination trials, with both valid and random cues. When the cues were valid, the visual cue, which was present throughout each trial, indicated how many trials remained to be successfully completed before a reward. Seventy-six percent of recorded neurons showed response selectivity, with the selectivity depending on some aspects of the current schedule. After a reward, when the monkeys knew that the upcoming cue would be valid, 88 of 246 (36%) neurons responded between schedules, seemingly anticipating the receiving information about the upcoming schedule length. When the cue appeared, 102 of 246 (41%) neurons became selective, at this point encoding information about whether the current trial was the only trial required or how many more trials are needed to obtain a reward. These cue-related responses had a median latency of 120 ms (just between the latencies in inferior temporal visual area TE and perirhinal cortex). When the monkey was releasing a touch bar to complete the trial correctly, 71 of 246 (29%) neurons responded, with responses in the rewarded trials being similar no matter which schedule was ending, thus being sensitive to the reward contingency. Finally, 39 of 246 (16%) neurons responded around the reward. We suggest that basolateral amygdala, by anticipating and then delineating the schedule and representing reward contingency, provide contextual information that is important for adjusting motivational level as a function of immediate behavior goals.",

         "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation.",

         "Over the past two decades, the role of apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs has become clear. Apoptosis may occur via a death receptor‐dependent (extrinsic) or independent (intrinsic or mitochondrial) pathway. Mitochondria play a central role in cell death in response to DNA damage, and mediate the interaction(s) of various cytoplasmic organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The mitochondrial pathway of cell death is mediated by Bcl‐2 family proteins, a group of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that regulate the passage of small molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis‐inducing factor, which activates caspase cascades, through the mitochondrial transition pore. In addition, apoptosis can induce autophagic cell death via crosstalk between the two pathways upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The current review focused on recent advances surrounding the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by anticancer agents and discussed potential molecular targets for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect(s) of anticancer agents.

         "Phytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in some cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many bacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phytochrome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features of a bonafide phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the chromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXα, which is produced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore was shown to be covalently attached via its A‐ring endo‐vinyl group to a cysteine residue outside the defined bilin lyase domain of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes. Site‐directed mutagenesis identified Cys12 and His247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility, respectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red‐light‐absorbing Pr form and immediately converted into a far‐red‐light‐absorbing Pfr‐enriched form. It shows the characteristic red/far‐red‐light‐induced photoreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that lacks the C15/16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to a 15Z/15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphorylation of PaBphP was demonstrated, confirming its role as a sensor kinase of a bacterial two‐component signaling system.",

         "Two subfamilies of the polar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) located on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis, along with unknown phospholipids, were recently shown to participate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages (Villeneuve, C., G. Etienne, V. Abadie, H. Montrozier, C. Bordier, F. Laval, M. Daffe, I. Maridonneau-Parini, and C. Astarie-Dequeker. 2003.

Biol. Chem. 278: 51291–51300). As demonstrated herein, a phospholipid mixture that derived from the methanol-insoluble fraction inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis. Inhibition was essentially attributable to phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), namely PIM2 and PIM6, because the purified phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were inactive. This was further confirmed using purified PIM2 and PIM6 from M. bovis BCG that decreased by half the internalization of M. smegmatis. Both compounds also inhibited the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium but had no effect on the internalization of zymosan used as a control particle of the phagocytic process. When coated on latex beads, PIM2 and polar GPL (GPL III) favored the particle entry through complement receptor 3. GPL III, but not PIM2, also directed particle entry through the mannose receptor. Therefore, surface-exposed mycobacterial PIM and polar GPL participate in the receptor-dependent internalization of mycobacteria in human macrophages.",

         "Few researchers would dispute that the pandemic of obesity is caused by a profound mismatch between humanity's present environmental circumstances and those that have moulded evolutionary selection. This concept was first articulated when gestational diabetes was described as being the result of a ‘thrifty genotype rendered detrimental by progress’. More recently, this hypothesis has been extended to the concept of a ‘thrifty phenotype’ to describe the metabolic adaptations adopted as a survival strategy by a malnourished fetus; changes that may also be inappropriate to deal with a later life of affluence. Both the thrifty genotype and the thrifty phenotype hypotheses would predict that populations in some areas of the developing world would be at greater risk of obesity and its co-morbidities; a proposition to be explored in the present paper. To date thrifty genes remain little more than a nebulous concept propagated by the intuitive logic that man has been selected to survive episodic famine and seasonal hungry periods. Under such conditions those individuals who could lay down extra energy stores and use them most efficiently would have a survival advantage. The search for candidate thrifty genes needs to cover every aspect of human energy balance from food-seeking behaviour to the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The present paper will describe examples of attempts to find thrifty genes in three selected candidate areas: maternally-transmitted mitochondrial genes; the uncoupling proteins; apoE4, whose geographical distribution has been linked to a possible thrifty role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.",

         "Real-time prediction of video source traffic is an important step in many network management tasks such as dynamic bandwidth allocation and end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control strategies. In this paper, an adaptive prediction model for MPEG-coded traffic is developed. A novel technology is used, first developed in the signal processing community, called sparse basis selection. It is based on selecting a small subset of inputs (basis) from among a large dictionary of possible inputs. A new sparse basis selection algorithm is developed that is based on efficiently updating the input selection adaptively. When a new measurement is received, the proposed algorithm updates the selected inputs in a recursive manner. Thus, adaptability is not only in the weight adjustment, but also in the dynamic update of the inputs. The algorithm is applied to the problem of single-step-ahead prediction of MPEG-coded video source traffic, and the developed method achieves improved results, as compared to the published results in the literature. The present analysis indicates that the adaptive feature of the developed algorithm seems to add significant overall value.",

         "BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process. First, a BXH-2–specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence–binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-γ in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.",

         "The functions of 17beta-estradiol (E2) are mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta. ERs display similar DNA- and ligand-binding properties in vitro. However, ERbeta shows lower transcriptional activity than ERalpha from the estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent signaling. We predicted that distinct amino termini contribute to differences in transcription efficacies of ERs by affecting in situ ER-ERE interactions. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and a novel in situ ERE competition assay, which is based on the ability of ER to compete for ERE binding with a designer activator that constitutively induces transcription from an ERE-driven reporter construct. Interference of activator-mediated transcription by unliganded or liganded ERs was taken as an indication of ER-ERE interaction. Results revealed that ERs interacted with ERE similarly in the absence of E2. However, E2 enhanced the ERE binding of ERalpha but not that of ERbeta. The removal of the amino terminus increased the ERbeta-ERE interaction independent of E2. The ERbeta amino terminus also prevented E2-mediated enhancement of the chimeric ERalpha-ERE interaction. Thus, the amino terminus of ERbeta impairs the binding of ERbeta to ERE. The abrogation of ligand-dependent activation function 2 of the amino-terminally truncated ERbeta resulted in the manifestation of E2 effect on ERbeta-ERE interaction. This implies that E2-mediated enhancement of ERbeta-ERE interaction is masked by the activation function 2, whereas the intact amino terminus is a dominant region that decreases the binding of ERbeta to ERE. Thus, ERbeta-ERE interaction is independent of E2 and is impaired by its amino terminus. These findings provide an additional explanation for differences between ERalpha and ERbeta functions that could differentially affect the physiology and pathophysiology of E2 signaling.",

         "We present a mobile acoustic beacon based sensor node localization method. Our technique is passive in that the sensor nodes themselves do not need to generate an acoustic signal for ranging. This saves cost, power and provides stealthy operation. Furthermore, the beacon can generate much more acoustic energy than a severely resource constrained sensor node, thereby significantly increasing the range. The acoustic ranging method uses a linear frequency modulated signal that can be accurately detected by matched filtering. This provides longer range and higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The localization algorithm was especially designed to work in such acoustically reverberant environment, as urban terrain. The algorithm presented handles non-Gaussian ranging errors caused by echoes. Node locations are computed centrally by solving a global non-linear optimization problem in an iterative and incremental fashion",

         "Researchers in the area of information security have mainly been concerned with tools, techniques and policies that firms can use to protect themselves against security breaches. However, information security is as much about security software as it is about secure software. Software is not secure when it has defects or flaws which can be exploited by hackers to cause attacks such as unauthorized intrusion or denial of service attacks. Any public announcement makes about a software defect is termed as 'vulnerability disclosure'. Although research in software economics have studied firms' incentive to improve overall quality, there have been no studies to show that software vendors have an incentive to invest in building more secure software. In this paper, we use the event study methodology to examine software vendors' incentives to build more secure software. We collect data from leading national newspapers and industry sources like CERT by searching for reports on published software vulnerabilities. We show that vulnerability disclosures lead to a negative and significant change in market value for a software vendor. On average, a vendor loses around 0.6% value in stock price when a vulnerability is reported. This is equivalent to a loss in market capitalization values of $0.86 billion per vulnerability announcement. To provide further insight, we use the information content of the disclosure announcement to classify vulnerabilities into various types. We find that the change in stock price is more negative if the vendor fails to provide a patch at the time of disclosure. Moreover, vulnerabilities which cause a confidentiality related breach cause a greater decline in the market value for a vendor than the vulnerabilities which cause non-confidentiality related breaches. Also, more severe flaws have a significantly greater impact than flaws with low or moderate severity. Finally, we find that the markets do not punish a software vendor more severely if a third party discovers a flaw in its product than if the vendor itself discovers the flaw. Our analysis provides many interesting implications for software vendors as well as policy makers.",

         "ABSTRACT Reliable and sensitive quantification of Phytophthora capsici in pepper plants is of crucial importance in managing the multiple syndromes caused by this pathogen. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the determination of P. capsici in pepper tissues. DNA levels of a highly virulent and a less virulent isolate were measured in different pepper genotypes with varying degrees of resistance. Using SYBR Green and specific primers for P. capsici, the minimal amount of pathogen DNA quantified was 10 pg. Pathogen DNA was recorded as early as 8 h postinoculation. Thereafter, the increase was rapid in susceptible cultivars and slower in resistant ones. The amount of pathogen DNA quantified in each pepper genotype correlated with susceptibility to Phytophthora root rot. Likewise, there was a relationship between the virulence of the pathogen and the degree of colonization. Differences also were found in oomycete amount among pepper tissues, with maximal pathogen biomass occurring in stems. The real-time PCR technique developed in this study was sensitive and robust enough to assess both pathogen development and resistance to Phytophthora root rot in different pepper genotypes.",

         "ABSTRACT Growth, patterning, and apoptosis are mutually interactive during development. For example, cells that select an abnormal fate in a developing field are frequently removed by apoptosis. An important issue in this process that needs to be resolved is the mechanism used by cells to discern their correct fate from an abnormal fate. In order to examine this issue, we developed an animal model that expresses the dioxin receptor homolog Spineless (Ss) ectopically in the Drosophila wing. The presence of mosaic clones ectopically expressing ss results in a local transformation of organ identity, homeosis, from wing into a leg or antenna. The cells with misspecified fates subsequently activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase to undergo apoptosis in an autonomous or nonautonomous manner depending on their position within the wing, suggesting that a cell-cell interaction is, at least in some cases, involved in the detection of misspecified cells. Similar position dependence is commonly observed when various homeotic genes controlling the body segments are ectopically expressed. The autonomous and nonautonomous apoptosis caused by ss is regulated by a novel leucine-rich repeat family transmembrane protein, Fish-lips (Fili) that interacts with surrounding normal cells. These data support a mechanism in which the lack of some membrane proteins helps to recognize the presence of different cell types and direct these cells to an apoptotic fate in order to exclude them from the normal developing field.",

         "The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression (\"reverse immunology\"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in proteomics for the identification of tumor antigens. These advances are opening the door for targeted vaccine development, and for using immune response signatures as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",

         "Two variants of the renal Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2), called NKCC2A and NKCC2F, display marked differences in Na+, Rb+, and Cl- affinities, yet are identical to one another except for a 23-residue membrane-associated domain that is derived from alternatively spliced exons. The proximal portion of these exons is predicted to encode the second transmembrane domain (tm2) in the form of an α-helix, and the distal portion, part of the following connecting segment (cs1a). In recent studies, we have taken advantage of the A–F differences in kinetic behavior to determine which regions in tm2-cs1a are involved in ion transport. Functional characterizations of chimeras in which tm2 or cs1a were interchanged between the variants showed that both regions are important in specifying ion affinities, but did not allow delineating the contribution of individual residues. Here, we have extended these structure-function analyses by studying additional mutants in which variant residues between A and F were interchanged individually in the tm2-cs1a region (amino acid number 216, 220, 223, 229, or 233 in NKCC2). None of the substitutions were found to affect Km (C1-), suggesting that the affinity difference for anion transport is conveyed by a combination of variant residues in this domain. However, 2 substitutions in the tm2 of F were found to affect cation constants specifically; interestingly, one of these mutations (residue 216) only affected Km (Rb+) while the other (residue 220) only affected Km (Na+). We have thus identified two novel residues in NKCC2 that play a key role in cation transport. Because such residues should be adjacent to one another on the vertical axis of the tm2 α-helix, our results imply, furthermore, that the ion transport sites in NKCC2 could be physically linked.",

         "BACKGROUND\nElevated concentrations of homocysteine in blood may be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations can be caused by decreased methylation of homocysteine to form methionine, as occurs in folate deficiency. A parallel pathway exists for methylation of homocysteine, in which choline, by way of betaine, is the methyl donor.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to determine whether choline deficiency results in a decreased capacity to methylate homocysteine.\n\n\nDESIGN\nC57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, or 35 mmol choline/kg diet for 3 wk. We then administered an oral methionine load to the animals and measured plasma homocysteine concentrations. Also, in a pilot study, we examined 8 men who were fed a diet providing 550 mg choline/d per 70 kg body weight for 10 d, followed by a diet providing almost no choline, until the subjects were clinically judged to be choline deficient or for <or=42 d. A methionine load was administered at the end of each dietary phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hours after the methionine load, choline-deficient mice had plasma homocysteine concentrations twice those of choline-fed mice. Four hours after the methionine load, clinically choline-depleted men had plasma homocysteine concentrations that were 35% greater than those in men not choline depleted.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that choline, like folate, plays an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine in humans and that response to a methionine load may be useful when assessing choline nutriture.",

         "Di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) is a common plasticizer and solvent that disrupts androgen-dependent male reproductive development in rats. In utero exposure to 500 mg/kg/day DBP on gestation days (GD) 12 to 21 decreases androgen biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in decreased fetal testicular testosterone levels. One consequence of prenatal DBP exposure is malformed epididymides in adult rats. Reduced fetal testosterone levels may be responsible for the malformation, since testosterone is required for Wolffian duct stabilization and their development into epididymides. Currently, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms of Wolffian duct differentiation. The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression associated with altered morphology of the proximal Wolffian duct following in utero exposure to DBP. Pregnant Crl:CD(R) (SD) rats were gavaged with corn oil vehicle or 500 mg/kg/day DBP from GD 12 to GD 19 or 21. There were only small morphological differences between control and DBP-exposed Wolffian ducts on GD 19. On GD 21, 89% of male fetuses in the DBP dose group showed marked underdevelopment of Wolffian ducts, characterized by decreased coiling. RNA was isolated from Wolffian ducts on GD 19 and 21. Together with empirical information, cDNA microarrays were used to help identify candidate genes that could be associated with the morphological changes observed on GD 21. These candidate genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Changes in mRNA expression were observed in genes within the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, the extracellular matrix, and in other developmentally conserved signaling pathways. On GD 19, immunolocalization of IGF-1 receptor protein demonstrated an increase in cytoplasmic expression in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells. There was also a variable decrease in androgen receptor protein in ductal epithelial cells on GD 19. This study provides insight into the effects of antiandrogens on the molecular mechanisms involved in Wolffian duct development. The altered morphology and changes in gene expression following DBP exposure are suggestive of altered paracrine interactions between ductal epithelial cells and the surrounding mesenchyme during Wolffian duct differentiation due to lowered testosterone production.",

We compare the average diameter and texture of cell nuclei in rat esophagus epithelial tissue to grading criteria established in a previous a/LCI study to prospectively grade neoplastic progression. We exploit the depth resolution of a/LCI to exclusively examine the basal layer of the epithelium, approximately 50 to 100 microm beneath the tissue surface, without the need for exogenous contrast agents, tissue sectioning, or fixation. The results of two studies are presented that compare the performance of two a/LCI modalities. Overall, the combined studies show 91% sensitivity and 97% specificity for detecting dysplasia, using histopathology as the standard. In addition, the studies enable the effects of dietary chemopreventive agents, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and curcumin, to be assessed by observing modulation in the incidence of neoplastic change. We demonstrate that a/LCI is highly effective for monitoring neoplastic change and can be applied to assessing the efficacy of chemopreventive agents in the rat esophagus.",

         "Rat Strain Effects of AT1 Receptor Activation on D1 Dopamine Receptors in Immortalized Renal Proximal Tubule Cells",
         "The dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems regulate blood pressure, in part, by affecting sodium transport in renal proximal tubules (RPTs). We have reported that activation of a D1-like receptor decreases AT1 receptor expression in the mouse kidney and in immortalized RPT cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The current studies were designed to test the hypothesis that activation of the AT1 receptor can also regulate the D1 receptor in RPT cells, and this regulation is aberrant in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Long-term (24 hours) stimulation of RPT cells with angiotensin II, via AT1 receptors increased total cellular D1 receptor protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in WKY but not in SHR cells. Short-term stimulation (15 minutes) with angiotensin II did not affect total cellular D1 receptor protein in either rat strain. However, in the short-term experiments, angiotensin II decreased cell surface membrane D1 receptor protein in WKY but not in SHR cells. D1 and AT1 receptors colocalized (confocal microscopy) and their coimmunoprecipitation was greater in WKY than in SHRs. However, AT1/D1 receptor coimmunoprecipitation was decreased by angiotensin II (10−8M/24 hours) to a similar extent in WKY (−22±8%) and SHRs (−22±12%). In summary, these studies show that AT1 and D1 receptors interact differently in RPT cells from WKY and SHRs. It is possible that an angiotensin II-mediated increase in D1 receptors and dissociation of AT1 from D1 receptors serve to counter regulate the long-term action of angiotensin II in WKY rats; different effects are seen in SHRs.",

         "The expression of cytokeratins in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) is rare and may lead to diagnostic confusion when it occurs. This report describes a metastatic GIST that stained strongly for cytokeratins, CD117, and CD34 in a patient who was previously diagnosed with gastric epithelioid angiosarcoma. A review of both tumours showed the same histological and immunohistochemical profiles, and c-kit molecular analysis revealed an insertional mutation at codon 558 of exon 11 in both tumours. Thus, pathologists should be aware that GISTs can occasionally express cytokeratins, and that c-kit mutational investigations may have a key diagnostic role and may prevent diagnostic mistakes that could have important clinical implications.",

         "Contribution of high p34cdc2 kinase activity to premature chromosome condensation of injected somatic cell nuclei in rat oocytes.",
         "The present study was undertaken to clarify the relationship between the p34cdc2 kinase activity of in vitro-aged or enucleated rat oocytes and the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) of microinjected cumulus cell nuclei. Wistar rat oocytes were placed in vitro up to 120 min after the animal was killed. The p34cdc2 kinase activity of the oocytes decreased in a time-dependent manner. The incidence of PCC was higher when nuclear injection into intact oocytes was completed in 15-45 min rather than 46-120 min. When rat oocytes were enucleated for subsequent nuclear injection, the p34cdc2 kinase activity transiently increased soon after enucleation but drastically decreased after 30 min. Removal of the cytoplasm instead of the meta-phase-plate did not affect the p34cdc2 kinase activity even after 60 min. PCC occurred in intact and cytoplasm-removed oocytes but not in enucleated oocytes. In contrast, oocytes from BDF1 mice exhibited a p34cdc2 kinase level twice that of rat oocytes and supported PCC despite enucleation. The p34cdc2 kinase level of intact rat oocytes was reduced to the equivalent level of aged (120 min) or enucleated (+60 min) oocytes by a 45 min treatment with roscovitine, an inhibitor of p34cdc2 kinase. None of the roscovitine-treated oocytes supported PCC while half of the control oocytes did. When rat oocytes were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, delayed inactivation of the p34cdc2 kinase was observed in the MG132-treated oocytes. A significantly higher proportion of the MG132-treated oocytes supported PCC when compared with the control oocytes. Moreover, a higher proportion of MG132-treated and enucleated oocytes carried two pseudo-pronuclei after cumulus cell injection and developed to the two-cell stage when compared with the enucleated oocytes at the telophase-II stage. These results suggest that the decreased level of p34cdc2 kinase activity in aged or enucleated rat oocytes is responsible for their inability to support PCC of microinjected donor cell nuclei and that inhibition of p34cdc2 kinase inactivation by chemicals such as MG132 is in part effective for rat oocytes to promote PCC and further development.",

         "OBJECTIVES\nTo compare the agreement between microbroth dilution and agar dilution for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Campylobacter jejuni.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUtilizing commercially prepared antimicrobial panels, microbroth dilution was compared with agar dilution for determining antimicrobial susceptibility in C. jejuni isolates. To assess the performance of both techniques for ampicillin, 190 C. jejuni isolates from dairy cattle were utilized. A group of 172 C. jejuni isolates from dairy sources were used to compare the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur results indicate that microbroth dilution and agar dilution agree within +/-1 log2 dilution for 86.7% of the isolates tested. Ciprofloxacin had the highest level of agreement for isolates tested by both techniques, resulting in a kappa of 0.886 and 97.1% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution. The least agreement was observed in determining the susceptibility of isolates to ampicillin and erythromycin (82.1 and 79.7% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution). However, kappa statistics were considered to have good agreement for these antimicrobials. There were no significant differences in the summary statistics for any of the five antimicrobials evaluated for the isolates analysed by the percentage of resistant isolates, MIC50, MIC75 or MIC90 beyond +/-1 log2 dilution. There was no association in the classification of resistance by the testing methods employed. We also demonstrated that the quality control strain of C. jejuni ATCC 33650 performed in a consistent manner for both agar dilution and microbroth dilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMicrobroth dilution may be an acceptable alternative to agar dilution for determining susceptibility of C. jejuni in research or surveillance where flow of samples, labour efficiency and cost may restrict the use of agar dilution.",

         "Explicit computational formulas for the coefficients of the periodic normal forms for all codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles in generic autonomous ODEs are derived. They include second-order coefficients for the fold (limit point) bifurcation, as well as third-order coefficients for the flip (period-doubling) and Neimark--Sacker (torus) bifurcations. The formulas are independent of the dimension of the phase space and involve solutions of certain boundary-value problems on the interval [0,T], where T is the period of the critical cycle, as well as multilinear functions from the Taylor expansion of the right-hand sides near the cycle. The formulas allow us to distinguish between sub- and supercritical bifurcations, in agreement with earlier asymptotic expansions of the bifurcating solutions. Our formulation makes it possible to use robust numerical boundary-value algorithms based on orthogonal collocation, rather than shooting techniques, which greatly expands its applicability. The actual implementation is described in detail. We include three numerical examples, in which codim 2 singularities are detected along branches of codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles as zeros of the periodic normal form coefficients.",
