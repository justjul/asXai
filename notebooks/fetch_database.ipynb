         "Repair of DNA damage is essential for genome integrity. DNA damage elicits a DNA damage response (DDR) that includes error-free and error-prone, i.e. mutagenic, repair. The SOS response is a widely conserved system in bacteria that regulates the DDR and depends on the recombinase RecA and the transcriptional repressor LexA. However, RecA/LexA-independent DDRs have been identified in several bacterial species. Here, using a whole-cell, label-free quantitative proteomics approach, we map the proteomic response in Myxococcus xanthus to mitomycin C treatment and the lack of LexA. In doing so, we confirm a LexA-independent DDR in M. xanthus. Using a candidate approach, we identify DdiA, a transcriptional regulator of the XRE family, and demonstrate that it regulates a subset of the LexA-independent DDR genes. ddiA is expressed heterogeneously in a subpopulation of cells in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress and reversibly induced population-wide in response to such stress. DdiA, indirectly or directly, activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Accordingly, the ΔddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, suggesting that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis. We speculate that the DdiA-dependent response is tailored to counter replication stress, thereby preventing the induction of the complete RecA/LexA-dependent DDR in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress. Importance DNA damage repair is essential for genome integrity and depends on the DNA damage response (DDR). While the RecA/LexA-dependent SOS response is widely conserved in bacteria, there are also RecA/LexA-independent DDRs. Here, we identify the DNA damage-induced transcriptional regulator DdiA in Myxococcus xanthus and demonstrate that it regulates part of the RecA/LexA-independent DDR. DdiA activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Because the ΔddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, we suggest that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis and that the DdiA-dependent DDR is specifically tailored to counter replication stress.",

         "Irregular codes are bottlenecked by memory and communication latency. Decoupled access/execute (DAE) is a common technique to tackle this problem. It relies on the compiler to separate memory address generation from the rest of the program, however, such a separation is not always possible due to control and data dependencies between the access and execute slices, resulting in a loss of decoupling. In this paper, we present compiler support for speculation in DAE architectures that preserves decoupling in the face of control dependencies. We speculate memory requests in the access slice and poison mis-speculations in the execute slice without the need for replays or synchronization. Our transformation works on arbitrary, reducible control flow and is proven to preserve sequential consistency. We show that our approach applies to a wide range of architectural work on CPU/GPU prefetchers, CGRAs, and accelerators, enabling DAE on a wider range of codes than before.",

         "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins which closely interact with their plasma membrane lipid microenvironment. Cholesterol is a lipid enriched at the plasma membrane with pivotal roles in the control of membrane fluidity and maintenance of membrane microarchitecture, directly impacting on GPCR stability, dynamics and function. Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation in vivo, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active versus inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor. This study 1) highlights the role of cholesterol in regulating GLP-1R responses in vivo; 2) provides a detailed map of GLP-1R - cholesterol binding sites in model membranes; 3) validates their functional relevance in beta cells; and 4) highlights their potential as locations for the rational design of novel allosteric modulators with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R responses.",

In practical scenarios, anytime algorithms are preferred for their ability to quickly generate initial motions and continuously refine them over time. In this letter, we present an algorithmic framework that adapts common graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms to be anytime and enhances their efficiency and effectiveness. Our key insight is to identify guide paths that approximately track the reference trajectory and strategically bias sampling toward the guide paths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by restructuring two existing graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms and evaluating the updated algorithms in three experiments.",

         "Disrupted intestinal epithelial barrier function has been proposed to be integral to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression and pathogenesis. To further define the molecular pathways in synovial inflammation and the response of the intestinal tissues, we have used a rat model of mono-joint inflammatory arthritis, induced by intra-articular injection of Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). The predominant inflammatory response of a single injection of the adjuvant into the knee joint resulted in rapid and reproducible formation of a fibrotic myeloid-infiltrated synovial pannus. Our aim was to determine how intestinal tissues, including the proximal and distal ileum and distal colon, responded to inflammatory changes in the synovium in a temporally coordinated manner by comparing their transcriptomic landscapes using RNASeq analyses. We confirmed the timeline of joint inflammation by knee joint swelling measurement, increased synovial fluid levels of bikunin (a component of both the acute phase protein pre-alpha-inhibitor and inter-alpha-inhibitor) and demonstrated a self-correcting response of trabecular and cortical bone to the CFA challenge. Intestine-specific responses were monitored by 16S microbiome amplicon sequencing, histopathology for mucus layer integrity, and immune cell immunohistochemistry. We present data that shows the intestinal tissue displays an allostatic response to the acute joint inflammation and was region specific. The ileum primarily responded with increased mucus secretion and silencing of T-cell specific pathways, whereas the colon showed a transient upregulation of macrophages, with a broader suppression of immune related and metabolic pathway related transcripts. Interestingly, many neuropathways were activated early but then suppressed later in both the ileum and colon. There were only insignificant changes in the fecal microbiome composition in ileum or colon post-CFA administration. In summary, our data show for the first time a suppression of intestinal inflammatory and immune responses following the induction of joint inflammation and only minimal and transient changes in the microbiome. The results help clarify the molecular responses of intestinal tissues to inflammatory stresses that accompany the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint diseases.",

         "Motivational theories of imitation state that we imitate because this led to positive social consequences in the past. Because movement imitation typically only leads to these consequences when perceived by the imitated person, it should increase when the interaction partner sees the imitator. Current evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, potentially due to the low ecological validity in previous studies. We conducted two experiments (NExperiment 1 = 94, NExperiment 2 = 110) in which we resolved this limitation by placing participants in a virtual environment with a seeing and a blindfolded virtual agent, where they reacted to auditory cues with a head movement to the left or right, while the agent(s) also made a left or right head movement. We tested the effect of model eyesight (Experiments 1 and 2) and social reward on imitation (Experiment 2). Data were collected in 2023 and 2024. As expected, participants tended to imitate the agents. However, we found only limited evidence for the effect of model eyesight on automatic imitation in Experiment 1 and no evidence for the effect of model eyesight or social reward in Experiment 2. These findings challenge claims made by motivational theories. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

         "Research on microbial communities colonizing animals has revealed that the microbiota, despite its typical containment to surfaces, influences virtually all organ systems of the host. In absence of a natural microbiota, the host’s development can be disturbed, but how developmental programs are affected by the microbiota is still poorly understood. Removing the microbiota from Hydra, a classic model animal in developmental biology, causes drastic developmental malformations and leads to polyps that temporarily lack the ability to bud. Recolonizing non-budding germfree Hydra with bacteria reverses this budding inhibition. Single-nucleus ATAC-seq detected a unique chromatin landscape associated with the non-budding phenotype. Single-cell RNA-seq and trajectory-based differential expression analysis showed that epithelial stem cell decision making is disturbed in non-budding polyps, whereby key developmental regulators are not expressed. This process is reversible by adding back bacteria. Transcriptionally silencing of one of the genes that failed to be activated in non-budding animals, GAPR1, led to polyps that have a significantly reduced budding capacity. The results show that maintaining a species-specific microbiota may enable the animal host to maintain its developmental program. Significance Statement Animal developmental programs work within the context of coevolved associations with microbes. Here, we provide mechanistic evidence of the involvement of the microbiota in maintaining the pattern formation program of Hydra with the asexual formation of buds in the lower part of the body column. We demonstrate that in the absence of bacteria both the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape is changed and that key regulatory factors are not expressed, causing changes in stem cell trajectories that result in loss of budding capacity. This study provides a new perspective on the role that microbiota plays during animal development and evolution.

         "Background The regulatory network that coordinates gene expression ultimately determines the phenotype of an organism. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators involved in key biological processes. Lineage-specific losses of multiple miRNA families are rare, and reported cases of multiple miRNA losses coincide with significant changes in gene regulation resulting in body plan modifications. Recently, 15 mammalian miRNA families were found to be missing in the Eumuroidea, the rodent lineage that includes the model organisms mouse and rat. However, the impact of their absence on the gene regulatory networks in this lineage remains unknown. Results The in silico characterization of all 15 miRNAs revealed that their absence is best explained by multiple independent losses. Analyzing their target genes in humans reveals a significant enrichment of GO- terms linked to cellular and developmental processes. Overexpressing two of the co-absent miRNAs, Mir-197 and Mir-769, in human and mouse inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) resulted in significantly perturbed expression patterns in both species. In silico target site prediction revealed a significant enrichment of direct targets exclusively in the down-regulated genes. Four genes were down-regulated in both mouse and human and maximum parsimony suggests that the corresponding miRNA target sites were already present in the last common ancestor of mammals. The response of these genes to miRNA overexpression in mice, therefore, unveils remnants of the ancient gene regulatory network that have persisted until today. The evolutionary age of these regulatory connections provides initial evidence that the miRNA losses in Eumuroidea must have had consequences for the regulation of gene expression. Notably, we show that the miRNA loss in the Eumuroidea coincides with the largest lineage-specific loss of transcription factors within the mammals. Conclusions The impact of miRNA losses has thus far been investigated on a gene-by-gene basis. Our findings indicate that cooperative effects between miRNAs should be considered when assessing the impact of miRNA loss. We provide evidence that the Eumuroidea have modified their gene regulatory networks on two levels, transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. It will now be interesting to precisely chart the differences in gene regulation and assess their combined impact on the suitability of mice and rats as model systems for human disease.",

         "Despite the major role of nurseries in raising young plants and trees prior to transplantation, not enough is known about how the nursery climate impacts the growth and development of plants from germination through to maturity. It is important for forestry practitioners to understand the effect that different nursery environments may have on early stage growth as these may exceed differences due to genetic variation and can confound the use of early stage traits for selection. Here, a replicated progeny-provenance experiment of the economically and ecologically important species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was established in three environmentally distinct nurseries in Scotland and traits including survival, growth, form and phenology were measured. Temperature variation and photoperiod were the only uncontrolled environmental variables during this period, and their effect on measured traits was found to be significant among nurseries from the first growing season onwards. Trait interactions were not consistent between nurseries, indicating that the effectiveness of using proxy traits to select for desirable characteristics may depend on the environment in which the trees are grown. This study is the first in a series that will examine trait variation in Scots pine from seedlings to mature trees and highlights the importance of carefully considering and accounting for the nursery environment when growing trees for subsequent transplantation.",

         "Purpose Diffusion MRI (dMRI) data typically suffer of significant cross-site variability, which prevents naively performing pooled analyses. To attenuate cross-site variability, harmonization methods such as the rotational invariant spherical harmonics (RISH) have been introduced to harmonize the dMRI data at the signal level. A common requirement of the RISH method, is the availability of healthy individuals who are matched at the group level, which may not always be readily available, particularly retrospectively. In this work, we propose a framework to harmonize dMRI without matched training groups. Methods Our framework learns harmonization features while controlling for potential covariates using a voxel-based generalized linear model (RISH-GLM). RISH-GLM allows to simultaneously harmonize data from any number of sites while also accounting for covariates of interest, thus not requiring matched training subjects. Additionally, RISH-GLM can harmonize data from multiple sites in a single step, whereas RISH is performed for each site independently. Results We considered data of training subjects from retrospective cohorts acquired with 3 different scanners and performed 3 harmonization experiments of increasing complexity. First, we demonstrate that RISH-GLM is equivalent to conventional RISH when trained with data of matched training subjects. Secondly, we demonstrate that RISH-GLM can effectively learn harmonization with two groups of highly unmatched subjects. Thirdly, we evaluate the ability of RISH-GLM to simultaneously harmonize data from 3 different sites. Discussion RISH-GLM can learn cross-site harmonization both from matched and unmatched groups of training subjects, and can effectively be used to harmonize data of multiple sites in one single step.",

         "Autophagy plays a key role in the responses to different stress condition in plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are common modulators of stress responses, having both toxic and signaling functions. In this context, the relationship between ROS and autophagy regulation remains unclear, and in some aspects, contradictory. In this study, we employed pharmacological and genetic approaches to investigate the effects of different ROS on the cytoplastic redox state and autophagic flux in Arabidopsis thaliana. Ours results demonstrated that oxidative treatments with H2O2 and MV, which drastically increased the oxidized state of the cytoplasm, reduced the autophagic flux. Conversely, singlet oxygen, which did not have significant effects on the cytoplasmic redox state, increased the autophagic flux. Additionally, our findings indicated that after H2O2 and high light treatments and during the recovery period, the cytoplasm returned to its reduced state, while autophagy was markedly induced. In summary, our study unveils the differential effects of ROS on the autophagic flux, establishing a correlation with the redox state of the cytoplasm. Moreover, it emphasizes the dynamic nature of autophagy in response to oxidative stress and the subsequent recovery period. HIGHLIGHTS This research shows the differential effects of reactive oxygen species on autophagic modulation, highlighting their impact on the cytoplasmic redox state. The relationship between ROS and autophagy regulation remains unclear, and in some aspect’s contradictory. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation characterizing the effects of different ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen, on the modulation of autophagy in Arabidopsis. In brief, our findings reveal differential impacts on cytoplasmic redox states and autophagic flux, providing insight into the dynamic nature of autophagy, especially in stress and post-stress conditions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to evaluate autophagic flux both during and after oxidative stress in plants. Our results indicate that this differentiation is crucial when analyzing the effects of oxidative stress on autophagy.",

         "Logic locking has emerged to prevent piracy and overproduction of integrated circuits ever since the split of the design house and manufacturing foundry was established. While there has been a lot of research using a single global key to lock the circuit, even the most sophisticated single-key locking methods have been shown to be vulnerable to powerful SAT-based oracle-guided attacks that can extract the correct key with the help of an activated chip bought off the market and the locked netlist leaked from the untrusted foundry. To address this challenge, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel logic locking method called K-Gate Lock that encodes input patterns using multiple keys that are applied to one set of key inputs at different operational times. Our comprehensive experimental results confirm that using multiple keys will make the circuit secure against oracle-guided attacks and increase attacker efforts to an exponentially time-consuming brute force search. K-Gate Lock has reasonable power and performance overheads, making it a practical solution for real-world hardware intellectual property protection.",

         "Silver(I) ions and organometallic complexes thereof are well established antimicrobial agents. They have been employed in medical applications for centuries. It is also known that some bacteria can resist to silver(I) treatments through an efflux mechanism. However, the exact mechanism of action remains unclear. All-atom force-field simulations can provide valuable structural and thermodynamic insights on the molecular processes of the underlying mechanism. Lennard-Jones parameters of silver(I) have been available for quite some time; their applicability to describe properly the binding properties (affinity, binding distance) between silver(I) and peptide-based binding motifs is, however, still an open question. Here, we demonstrate that the standard 12-6 Lennard-Jones parameters (previously developed to describe the hydration free energy with the TIP3P water model) significantly underestimate the interaction strength between silver(I) and both methionine and histidine. These are two key amino-acid residues in silver(I)-binding motifs of proteins involved in the efflux process. Using free-energy calculations, we calibrated non-bonded fix (NBFIX) parameters for the CHARMM36m force field to reproduce the experimental binding constant between amino acid sidechain fragments and silver(I) ions. We then successfully validated the new parameters on a set of small silver-binding peptides with experimentally known binding constants. In addition, we could monitor how silver(I) ions increase the α-helical content of the LP1 oligopeptide, in agreement with previously reported Circular Dichroism (CD) experiments. Future improvements are outlined. The implementation of these new parameters is straightforward in all simulation packages that can use the CHARMM36m force field. It sets the stage for the modeling community to study more complex silver(I)-binding processes such as the interaction with silver(I)-binding-transporter proteins.",

         "Existing models of human growth provide little insight into underlying mechanisms responsible for inter-individual and inter-population variation in children’s growth trajectories. Building on general theories linking growth to metabolic rates, we develop a causal parametric model of height and weight growth incorporating a representation of human body allometry and a process-partitioned representation of ontogeny. This model permits separation of metabolic causes of growth variation, potentially influenced by nutrition and disease, from allometric factors, potentially under stronger genetic control. We estimate model parameters using a Bayesian multilevel statistical design applied to temporally-dense height and weight measurements of U.S. children, and temporally-sparse measurements of Indigenous Amazonian children. This facilitates a comparison of the contributions of metabolism and allometry to observed cross-cultural variation in the growth trajectories of the two populations, and permits simulation of the effects of healthcare interventions on growth. This theoretical model provides a new framework for exploring the causes of growth variation in our species, while potentially guiding the development of appropriate, and desired, healthcare interventions in societies confronting growth-related health challenges, such as malnutrition and stunting.",

         "Higher-order ambisonic rendering is an increasingly common soundscape reproduction technique that, in theory, enables presentation of virtual sounds at nearly any location in 3D space, relatively unconstrained by the veridical locations of loudspeakers. We evaluated whether 3D sound reproduction through a 9th-order ambisonic loudspeaker array was indeed sufficiently accurate to probe the limits of human spatial perception. We first estimated minimum audible angles for human listeners for a variety of reference points on the horizontal plane. We demonstrated that the system can reproduce sounds with a spatial resolution that is equal or superior to the limits of human acuity, at least on the horizontal plane at the front. Importantly, the resolution of ambisonic reproduction appeared equivalent for regions of the system with high and low loudspeaker density. We also estimated localization cues at the same locations and showed that although localization cues for low-frequency components were well preserved, they were somewhat distorted for components above 4000 Hz. Finally, we provide evidence that these high-frequency distortions can serve elevation cues by human listeners. In summary, we showed that a 9th order ambisonic system is able to render highly focal sound sources, and that high-frequency reproduction distortions may introduce unwanted localization cues.",

         "This study presents a novel approach to examining the psychological impact of emerging technologies through the development of a Hype Cycle Model (HCM), utilizing sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Focusing on electric vehicles, we investigate how public sentiment—captured via social media comments—reflects the psychological effects of technology adoption and hype. Our model integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses, utilizing sentiment scoring and topic modeling to explore thematic psychological trends. An analysis of approximately 43,000 social media comments on electric vehicles demonstrated that the integration of expert knowledge with public sentiment provides a comprehensive understanding of technology hype dynamics. The results revealed that sentiment analysis enables real-time tracking of emotional responses to emerging technologies, while Correlated Topic Modeling (CTM) offers contextual insights into the positioning of technologies within the HCM. These findings demonstrate that understanding public sentiment towards emerging technologies can provide valuable insights for both organizations and policymakers in technology forecasting and adoption planning. Our approach transforms the traditional black box implementation by Gartner Inc. into a transparent framework that illuminates the psychological underpinnings of technology hype, revealing how collective excitement, expectations, and emotional responses shape the trajectory of emerging technology adoption.",

         "Contamination is one of the major threats to freshwater biodiversity. Compared to other aquatic ecosystems, peri-urban ponds are unique because they are embedded in human-dominated areas. However, it is poorly understood how different land uses such as urban or agricultural contribute multiple pollutants to ponds and thus affect pond biodiversity. In this work, 12 ponds located in a peri-urban area (Ile-de-France region, France) were monitored for 2 consecutive years in spring and fall. We surveyed macroinvertebrates and measured the physicochemical parameters and contaminants of different classes (trace elements, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in both water and sediment. The objective was twofold: (1) to explore local and regional macroinvertebrate spatiotemporal diversity and (2) to understand the effects of contaminants on community structure. We observed 236 macroinvertebrate morphotaxa, none of which were rare or sensitive to pollutants. Morphotaxa richness showed small differences between ponds but no difference between there was no effect of field campaign. There was no effect of ponds and field campaign on morphotaxa diversity and equitability. We did not observe a relationship between land use around the pond (agricultural, urban, or semi-natural) and diversity indices with the exception of the proportion of agricultural land in the vicinity of the pond on equitability. Regional beta diversity (between ponds) showed that differences in morphotaxa composition reflected species replacement more than differences in species richness; these were primarily due to the high abundance of pollutant-tolerant species in some of the ponds. The effects of environmental parameters on community structure were studied using partial redundancy analysis based on the presence-absence of morphotaxa, showing that community assemblages are shaped by sediment levels of pharmaceuticals, water conductivity and ammonium concentration. In conclusion, ponds in peri-urban areas are exposed to various human activities, with our results suggesting that this exposure leads to chronic and diverse contaminations that affect morphotaxa communities.",

         "Understanding population structure is essential for conservation genetics, as it provides insights into population connectivity and supports the development of targeted strategies to preserve genetic diversity and adaptability. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) have proven effective for revealing population genetic structures in human and model organisms using hard-called genotypes, but their application in wild species using genotype likelihoods from low coverage sequencing (as a cost-saving measure) remains underexplored. Here, we present a Jupyter Notebook-based workflow that facilitates the use of UMAP and t-SNE on genotype likelihood-derived principal components. This workflow is demonstrated using medium to low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data from scimitar-horned oryx, which has been reintroduced into the wild and faces multiple conservation challenges. Detailed guidance on hyperparameter tuning and practical implementation is also provided, enhancing the application of these methods in wildlife genetics to potentially support biodiversity conservation.",

         "Background Patients with gastric cancer (GC) are prone to lymph node metastasis (LNM), which is an important factor for recurrence and poor prognosis of GC. Nowadays, more and more studies have confirmed that exosomes can participate in tumor lymphangiogenesis. An in-depth exploration of the pathological mechanism in the process of LNM in GC may provide effective targets and improve the diagnosis and treatment effect. Materials and Methods We used sequencing analysis of collected serum to screen out exo-miRNA related to LNM in GC. ELISA, qRT-PCR, Western Blot, RNA pull-down assay, Transwell assay, animal experiments, and other experiments were used to verify the results. Results In this study, we screened out miR-224-3p related to GC progression and LNM in a vascular endothelial growth Factor C (VEGFC)-independent manner. We found that exo-miR-224-3p derived from GC cells could enter human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) and promote the tube formation and migration of HLECs. In addition, it was revealed that miR-224-3p could bind to the 3′UTR region of GSK3B mRNA. Then, we proved that inhibiting the expression of GSK3B could suppress the phosphorylation of β-catenin and promote the transcription of PROX1, thus leading to tumor lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, it was also found that hnRNPA1 mediated the sorting of miR-224-3p into exosomes, and the high expression of PKM2 promoted the secretion of exo-miR-224-3p. Conclusions Our discovery of the exo-miR-224-3p/GSK3B/β-catenin/PROX1 axis may provide a new direction for the clinical treatment of GC.",

         "High mobility environment leads to severe Doppler effects and poses serious challenges to the conventional physical layer based on the widely popular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The recent emergence of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, along with its many related variants, presents a promising solution to overcome such channel Doppler effects. This paper aims to clearly establish the relationships among the various manifestations of OTFS. Among these related modulations, we identify their connections, common features, and distinctions. Building on existing works, this work provides a general overview of various OTFS-related detection schemes and performance comparisons. We first provide an overview of OFDM and filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) by demonstrating OTFS as a precoded FBMC through the introduction of inverse symplectic finite Fourier transform (ISFFT). We explore the relationship between OTFS and related modulation schemes with similar characteristics. We provide an effective channel model for high-mobility channels and offer a unified detection representation. We provide numerical comparisons of power spectrum density (PSD) and bit error rate (BER) to underscore the benefit of these modulation schemes in high-mobility scenarios. We also evaluate various detection schemes, revealing insights into their efficacies. We discuss opportunities and challenges for OTFS in high mobility, setting the stage for future research and development in this field.",

         "The structural basis for the pharmacology of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the most abundant membrane proteins and the target of about 35% of approved drugs, is still a matter of intense study. What makes GPCRs challenging to study is the inherent flexibility and the metastable nature of interaction with extra-and intracellular partners that drive their effects. Here, we present a molecular dynamics (MD) adaptive sampling algorithm, namely multiple walker supervised molecular dynamics (mwSuMD), to address complex structural transitions involving GPCRs without energy input. We first report the binding and unbinding of the vasopressin peptide from its receptor V2. Successively, we present the complete transition of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) from inactive to active, agonist and Gs-bound state, and the GDP release from Gs. To our knowledge, this is the first time the whole sequence of events leading from an inactive GPCR to the GDP release is simulated without any energy bias. We demonstrate that mwSuMD can address complex binding processes intrinsically linked to protein dynamics out of reach of classic MD.",

         "During brain development, synapses are initially formed in excess and are later eliminated in an activity-dependent manner. Weak synapses are preferentially removed, but the mechanism linking neuronal activity to synapse removal is unclear. Here we show that, in the developing mouse visual pathway, inhibiting synaptic transmission induces postsynaptic activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 deficiency results in defects in synapse elimination driven by both spontaneous and experience-dependent neural activity. Notably, caspase-3 deficiency blocks activity-dependent synapse elimination, as evidenced by reduced engulfment of inactive synapses by microglia. Furthermore, in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, caspase-3 deficiency protects against synapse loss induced by amyloid-β deposition. Our results reveal caspase-3 activation as a key step in activity-dependent synapse elimination during development and synapse loss in neurodegeneration.",

         "In the pursuit of replicating biological processes at the nanoscale, controlling cellular membrane dynamics has emerged as a key area of interest. Here, we report a system mimicking virus assembly to control directional membrane budding. We employ three-dimensional DNA origami techniques to construct cholesterol-modified triangles that self-assemble into polyhedral shells on lipid vesicles, resulting in gradual curvature induction, bud formation and spontaneous neck scission. Strategic positioning of cholesterols on the triangle surface provides control over the directionality of bud growth and yields daughter vesicles with DNA endo- or exoskeletons reminiscent of clathrin-coated vesicles. This process occurs with rapid kinetics and across various lipid compositions. When combined into a two-step process, nested bivesicular objects with DNA shells encapsulated between lipid vesicles could be produced. Our work replicates key aspects of natural endocytic and exocytic pathways, opening new avenues for exploring membrane mechanics and applications in targeted drug delivery and synthetic biology.",

         "Marine plankton communities consist of numerous species, and their composition and physiological states are closely linked to ecosystem functions. Understanding biogeochemical cycles requires measuring taxon-specific mortality due to viral lysis or sloppy feeding, as the dissolved organic matter released contributes to rapid nutrient recycling and long-term carbon sequestration following microbial transformation. This study introduces a quantitative and comprehensive analysis of microeukaryotes in the dissolved constituents of seawater by using Mortality by Ribosomal Sequencing (MoRS) method. Our experimental pipeline successfully recovered 83% of cell-free rRNA. The ratio of cell-free rRNA to cell-associated rRNA was more than 10-fold higher in the mesopelagic layer than in the upper epipelagic layer, suggesting the mesopelagic zone as a hotspot for eukaryotic cell lysis. Many protist lineages, including phytoplankton such as haptophytes, are less susceptible to cell lysis in the epipelagic layer yet are actively lysed in the mesopelagic zone. Notably, over 86% of the significantly lysed species in the mesopelagic layer showed a habitat preference for the epipelagic layer. These findings indicate that sinking from the surface and lysis in the mesopelagic are prevalent dynamics for various eukaryotes.",

         "“Open ended” or “dark taxa” are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with low-cost DNA barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of taxonomic revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the Mycetophilidae fungus gnats (Diptera) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 samples collected with 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 sites in different habitats in Singapore: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for 1,454 specimens, we delimit 120 species of 23 genera. Of these, only five were species previously described. The remaining 115 species are new to science and described here. We name, however, only 98 of these species since 14 species are currently only known from females and we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis (Manota spp. A–G and Neoempheria spp. A–G), and three species lack molecular data (Epicypta sp. A, Epicypta sp. B, and Neoempheria sp. H). To assess congruence between species delimited with DNA barcodes (3% clusters) and morphology, we determined a match ratio and found it to be overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for MOTUs clustered at 5% with Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD set to (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 20:1. Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by about 25%, highlighting the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three genera—Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus— Integricypta, gen. n., which is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless—belonging to the Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini based on three species. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Søli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula), and Chalastonepsia hokkaidensis Kallweit a species spread in east Asia. The mycomyine genus Vecella Wu & Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu & Yang), n. comb. corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of Parempheriella. Barcodes for a second set of 1,493 Singapore mycetophilid specimens suggest the presence of an additional 18 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the Singapore species that routinely enter Malaise traps are identified or described here. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula. Zusammenfassung “Open-ended” oder “Dark Taxa” sind artenreiche Klade, die so abundant und arteinreich sind, dass die herkömmlichen taxonomischen Methoden angesichts der großen Anzahl von Exemplaren und Arten nicht gut funktionieren. Neue Ansätze, die auf das Vorsortierung von Exemplaren mit DNA Barcodes bis zum Artniveau basieren, erlauben es jetzt aber solche Taxa zu revidieren. Allerdings kann auch mit DNA Barcodes, nur die Fauna eines vergleichsweise kleinen Gebietes bearbeiten werden, weil für die meisten Länder und biogeografischen Regionen zu viele Exemplare und Arten abgedeckt werden müssten. Wir demonstrieren hier wie eine solche Revision durchgeführt werden kann. Wir revidieren hier die Pilzmücken (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) von Singapur, die mit Malaisefallen gefangen werden können. Das hier überarbeitete Material stammt aus 496 Malaise-Fallenproben, die mit 71 Malaise-Fallen an 107 Sammelstellen in verschiedenen Habitaten gefangen wurden: Mangroven, Sumpfwälder, Süßwassersümpfe, Primärregenwälder und Sekundärwälder. Basierend auf molekularen und morphologischen Daten für mehr als 1454 Tiere grenzen wir 120 Arten mit molekularen und morphologischen Daten ab, wobei nur 5 dieser Arten bereits beschrieben sind. Die verbleibenden 115 werden hier beschrieben. Allerdings benennen wir nur 98 Arten, da für zwei Arten molekulare Daten fehlen und für 14 weitere Arten derzeit nur Weibchen bekannt sind. Daher können wir derzeit keine zufriedenstellende morphologische Diagnose erstellen. Darüber hinaus fehlen molekulare Daten für drei Arten (Epicypta sp. A, Epicypta sp. B und Neoempheria sp. H). Was die Artgrenzen betrifft, so stimmen die molekularen und morphologischen Daten in den meisten Fällen überein (match ratio: 95% für 3% MOTUs). Eine noch höhere „match ratio“ von 99% wird für 5% und ABGD MOTUs (P=0,060) beobachtet. Insgesamt ist das Verhältnis zwischen unbeschrieben und beschrieben erstaunlich hoch (20:1), und die Überarbeitung der singapurer Fauna erhöht die Anzahl der beschriebenen Arten in der Orientalischen Region um über 25%. Dies unterstreicht den Ausmaß des „taxonomic impediments“ für Pilzmücken. Die meisten der Mycetophilidenarten in Singapur gehören zu drei von 22 Gattungen - Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 Arten), Epicypta Winnertz (29 Arten) und Manota Williston (14 Arten), aber wir beschreiben hier auch eine neue Gattung, Integricypta, gen. n. basierend auf drei Arten. Die Gattung gehört zu den Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini und ist die mutmaßliche Schwestergruppe von Aspidionia Colless. Die sequenzierten, illustrierten und benannten Arten sind: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

         "Understanding neural activity organization is vital for deciphering brain function. By recording whole-brain calcium activity in larval zebrafish during hunting and spontaneous behaviors, we find that the shape of the neural activity space, described by the neural covariance spectrum, is scale-invariant: a smaller, randomly sampled cell assembly resembles the entire brain. This phenomenon can be explained by Euclidean Random Matrix theory, where neurons are reorganized from anatomical to functional positions based on their correlations. Three factors contribute to the observed scale invariance: slow neural correlation decay, higher functional space dimension, and neural activity heterogeneity. In addition to matching data from zebrafish and mice, our theory and analysis demonstrate how the geometry of neural activity space evolves with population sizes and sampling methods, thus revealing an organizing principle of brain-wide activity.",

         "Genotype-phenotype mapping (GPM), or the association of trait variation to genetic variation, has been a long-lasting problem in biology. The existing approaches to this problem allowed researchers to partially understand within– and between-species variation as well as the emergence or evolution of phenotypes. However, traditional GPM methods typically ignore the transcriptome or have low statistical power due to challenges related to dataset scale. Thus, it is not clear to what extent selection modulates transcriptomes and whether cis-or trans-regulatory elements are more important. To overcome these challenges, we leveraged the cost efficiency and scalability of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by collecting data from 18,233 yeast cells from 4,489 F2 segregants derived from an F1 cross between the laboratory strain BY4741 and the vineyard strain RM11-1a. More precisely, we performed eQTL mapping with the scRNA-seq data to identify single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) and transcriptome variation patterns associated with fitness variation inferred from the segregant bulk fitness assay. Due to the larger scale of our dataset and its multidimensionality, we could recapitulate results from decades of work in GPM from yeast bulk assays while revealing new associations between phenotypic and transcriptomic variations at a broad scale. We evaluated the strength of the association between phenotype variation and expression variation, revealed new hotspots of gene expression regulation associated to trait variation, revealed new gene function with high expression heritability and highlighted the larger aggregate effect of trans-regulation compared to cis-regulation Altogether these results suggest that integrating large-scale scRNA-seq data into GPM improves our understanding of trait variation in the context of transcriptomic regulation.",

         "During sleep, our brain undergoes highly synchronized activity, orchestrated by distinct neural rhythms. Little is known about the associated brain activation during these sleep rhythms, and even less about their functional implications. In this study, we investigated the brain-wide activation underlying human sleep rhythms by employing simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 107 participants during nocturnal nap (first half of the night). We identified robust coupling between slow oscillations (SOs) and fast spindles during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (N2/3 stages), with spindle peaks consistently occurring just before the SO UP-state. This SO-spindle coupling was linked to elevated activation in both the thalamus and hippocampus, alongside increased functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus and from the thalamus to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). An open-ended cognitive state decoding analysis suggested that these activations may relate to episodic memory processes, yet were distinct from task-related networks. Together, these findings highlight the thalamus as a key coordinator of hippocampal-cortical communication during sleep and provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronized sleep rhythms may support memory consolidation.",

         "Sponges, comprising over 9000 recorded species, represent one of the most primitive groups of metazoans. Given the importance of species distribution records and the identification of new species in scientific research, these endeavors play a crucial role in enhancing ecological insights, conserving biodiversity, facilitating a better understanding of the relationships between various groups of organisms, advancing our knowledge of evolution, and potentially expanding biomedical implications. In this study, we used basic morphological data, mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene, and Internal Transcribed Spacer two (ITS2) regions to evaluate the Terpios samples collected from four coastal sites along the northeastern Mediterranean Sea, covering a distance of approximately 450 km. For this purpose, 81 COI and 11 ITS2 records of the order Suberitida were mined from GenBank, and species delimitation analysis was performed using both the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery method and the Poisson Tree Process (PTP), along with 11 samples from the present study. While we observed slight differences in spicule sizes, the overall morphology of all samples from our study was similar. Within the scope of this research, we report the first-ever presence record of T. gelatinosus in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, we document evidence pointing to the potential existence of cryptic speciation in the region.",

         "Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) revolutionized genome editing by enabling programmable DNA cleavage guided by an RNA. However, SpCas9 tolerates mismatches in the DNA-RNA duplex, which can lead to deleterious off-target editing. Here, we reveal that Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9) possesses a unique structural feature—the REC3 clamp—that underlies its intrinsic high-fidelity DNA targeting. Through kinetic and structural analyses, we show that the REC3 clamp forms critical contacts with the PAM-distal region of the R-loop, thereby imposing a novel checkpoint during enzyme activation. Notably, F. novicida encodes a non-canonical small CRISPR-associated RNA (scaRNA) that enables FnCas9 to repress an endogenous bacterial lipoprotein gene, subverting host immune detection. Structures of FnCas9 with scaRNA illustrate how partial R-loop complementarity hinders REC3 clamp docking and prevents cleavage in favor of transcriptional repression. The REC3 clamp is conserved in type II-B CRISPR-Cas9 systems, pointing to a potential path for engineering precise genome editors or developing novel antibacterial strategies. These findings reveal the dual mechanisms of high specificity and virulence by FnCas9, with broad implications for biotechnology and therapeutic development. Graphical Abstract",

         "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic disease that poses significant economic burden and health risks. It is pivotal to better understand brain mechanisms engaged by alcohol that promote misuse. The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged as a key mediator of excessive preclinical alcohol consumption. A dynorphin-expressing subpopulation within the CeA (CeADyn) has been implicated in excessive alcohol drinking, yet how cellular activity of CeADyn neurons relates to ongoing alcohol drinking is not well-understood. The current study interrogated the engagement of CeADyn neurons in male and female mice during voluntary alcohol consumption using fiber photometry and compared this cellular response with that of other solutions having similar motivational and/or taste characteristics. Activity of a calcium sensor, GCaMP7f, expressed in mouse CeADyn neurons was recorded and time-locked to bouts of drinking. Multilevel linear mixed modeling was applied to better resolve focal effects from complex data. These analyses revealed a relatively large increase in CeADyn neuron calcium transients after bouts of alcohol drinking compared to water or sucrose drinking, indicating these neurons are uniquely engaged during alcohol consumption. Drinking behavior unique to alcohol (i.e., longer bout durations) did not fully explain signal differences between alcohol and other solutions nor did the relatively increased alcohol response diminish over time. No other conditions or solutions tested reproduced the pronounced change in CeADyn activity associated with alcohol drinking. These findings, collectively, support the presence of a unique functional signature for alcohol in a cell population known to control excessive alcohol drinking. Highlights Central amygdala dynorphin cells (CeADyn) are firmly implicated in alcohol misuse. CeADyn neuron activity was higher when mice drank alcohol versus other solutions. Neither how mice drank alcohol nor motivational states could explain this activity. CeADyn neurons having uniquely high alcohol responses may underlie AUD development.",

         "Transposable elements (TEs) are powerful drivers of genome evolution, in part through their ability to rapidly rewire the host regulatory network by creating transcription factor binding sites that can potentially be turned to the host’s advantage in a process called exaptation. However, the effects on the host phenotype vary widely among different TEs. Here, we classify TEs based on their contribution to the human host phenotypes at both molecular and macroscopic scales. TE contributions to chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and the heritability of complex traits are strongly correlated to each other, confirming that the main mechanism through which TEs affect the host phenotype is through the rewiring of the regulatory network. TE sequence and evolutionary features are able to explain a large fraction of the variance in phenotypic relevance, and in particular more than 50% of the variance of their contribution to the heritability of complex traits. A conspicuous exception to this pattern is represented by TEs of the ERV1 family, whose phenotypic impact cannot be explained by our model: In particular, this family includes a set of relatively young TEs whose phenotypic relevance is much larger than would be expected based on their sequence and evolutionary parameters. These TEs are involved in fast-evolving biological processes related to the interaction of the organism with its environment. In conclusion, our results confirm quantitatively that TE insertions affect the host phenotype mostly through the rewiring of its regulatory network; identify a signature of phenotypic relevance based on sequence and conservation properties; and highlight several TEs as promising candidates for functional studies.",

         "The Passive Optical Network (PON) has been evolving continuously in terms of architecture and capacity to keep up with the demand for high-speed Internet access in the access network segment. Recently, integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which provides programmable and (logically) centralized network control, with PON has attracted intensive research interest to further enhance PON performance and reduce operational and capital expenditure. Although PON is regarded as an energy-efficient access network solution, it would be a major contributor for increasing energy consumption in the access network segment because of its higher penetration rate than other access network technologies. Over the past several years, the major standardization bodies like IEEE and ITU-T, and research communities have engaged in introducing energy-efficient PON solutions. This article familiarizes readers with PON evolution in terms of capacity, architecture, and its integration with virtualization and SDN based control. We present a comprehensive survey of the energy conservation research efforts in PON starting from conventional PON to SDN based PON leveraging virtual and physical network functions. This article also presents contemporary energy-efficient standardization activities in IEEE and ITU-T. To the best of our knowledge, to date, this article is the first most comprehensive survey on energy saving research and standardization on PON. We summarize the lessons learned from the recent advancements, identify important challenges ahead and outline several future research directions that can contribute to further advancement of energy-efficient PON.",

Using the lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm), a serious agricultural pest, as a model, we determined that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) cadherin 96ca (CAD96CA) and fibroblast growth factor receptor homologue (FGFR1) function as JH cell membrane receptors by their roles in JH-regulated gene expression, larval status maintaining, rapid intracellular calcium increase, phosphorylation of JH intracellular receptor MET1 and cofactor Taiman, and high affinity to JH III. Gene knockout of Cad96ca and Fgfr1 by CRISPR/Cas9 in embryo and knockdown in various insect cells, and overexpression of CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mammalian HEK-293T cells all supported CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmitting JH signal as JH cell membrane receptors.",

         "Bursty gene expression is characterised by two intuitive parameters, burst frequency and burst size, the cell-cycle dependence of which has not been extensively profiled at the transcriptome level. In this study, we estimate the burst parameters per allele in the G1 and G2/M cell-cycle phases for thousands of mouse genes by fitting mechanistic models of gene expression to mRNA count data, obtained by sequencing of single cells whose cell-cycle position has been inferred using a deep-learning method. We find that upon DNA replication, the median burst frequency approximately halves, while the burst size remains mostly unchanged. Genome-wide distributions of the burst parameter ratios between the G2/M and G1 phases are wide, indicating substantial heterogeneity in transcriptional regulation patterns. We also observe a significant negative correlation between the burst frequency and size ratios, suggesting that regulatory processes do not independently control the burst parameters. Finally, we argue that to accurately estimate the burst parameter ratios, mechanistic models must explicitly account for gene copy number variation and extrinsic noise due to the coupling of transcription to cell age within the cell cycle, but corrections for technical noise due to imperfect capture of RNA molecules in sequencing experiments are less critical.",

         "Cancer cells display high levels of oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) and rely on DNA damage checkpoint for viability. This feature is exploited by cancer therapies to either increase RS to unbearable levels or inhibit checkpoint kinases involved in the DNA damage response. Thus far, treatments that combine these two strategies have shown promise but also have severe adverse effects. To identify novel, better-tolerated anticancer combinations, we screened a collection of plant extracts and found two natural compounds from the plant, Psoralea corylifolia, that synergistically inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Bakuchiol inhibited DNA replication and activated the checkpoint kinase CHK1 by targeting DNA polymerases. Isobavachalcone interfered with DNA double-strand break repair by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and DNA end resection. The combination of bakuchiol and isobavachalcone synergistically inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Importantly, it also prevented tumor development in xenografted NOD/SCID mice. The synergistic effect of inhibiting DNA replication and CHK2 signaling identifies a vulnerability of cancer cells that might be exploited by using clinically approved inhibitors in novel combination therapies.",

         "Long-read sequencing techniques can sequence transcripts from end to end, greatly improving our ability to study the transcription process. Although there are several well-established tools for long-read transcriptome analysis, most are reference-based. This limits the analysis of organisms without high-quality reference genomes and samples or genes with high variability (e.g., cancer samples or some gene families). In such settings, analysis using a reference-free method is favorable. The computational problem of clustering long reads by region of common origin is well-established for reference-free transcriptome analysis pipelines. Such clustering enables large datasets to be split up roughly by gene family and, therefore, an independent analysis of each cluster. There exist tools for this. However, none of those tools can efficiently process the large amount of reads that are now generated by long-read sequencing technologies. We present isONclust3, an improved algorithm over isONclust and isONclust2, to cluster massive long-read transcriptome datasets into gene families. Like isONclust, IsONclust3 represents each cluster with a set of minimizers. However, unlike other approaches, isONclust3 dynamically updates the cluster representation during clustering by adding high-confidence minimizers from new reads assigned to the cluster and employs an iterative cluster-merging step. We show that isONclust3 yields results with higher or comparable quality to state-of-the-art algorithms but is 10-100 times faster on large datasets. Also, using a 256Gb computing node, isONclust3 was the only tool that could cluster 37 million PacBio reads, which is a typical throughput of the recent PacBio Revio sequencing machine.

         "RNA metabolism is tightly regulated by cis-elements and trans-acting factors. Most information guiding such regulation is encoded in RNA sequences. Considering the similarities in semantic and syntactic features between RNAs and human language, we developed LAMAR, a transformer-based foundation language model for RNA regulation, to decipher general rules underlying RNA processing. The model was pretrained on approximately 15 million sequences from both genome and transcriptome of 225 mammals and 1569 viruses, and further fine-tuned with labeled datasets for various tasks. The resulting fine-tuned models outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in predicting mRNA translation efficiency and mRNA half-life, while achieving comparable accuracy to specifically designed methods in predicting splice sites of pre-mRNAs and internal ribosome entry sites. Our results indicated that a single foundation language model is applicable in the comprehensive analysis of different aspects of RNA regulation, providing new insight into the design and optimization of RNA drugs.",

         "Wildfires ignited by the power lines have become increasingly common over the past decade. Enhancing the operational and financial resilience of power grids against wildfires involves a multifaceted approach. Key proactive measures include meticulous vegetation management, strategic grid hardening such as infrastructure undergrounding, preemptive de-energization, and disaster risk financing, among others. Each measure should be tailored to prioritize efforts in mitigating the consequences of wildfires. This paper proposes a transmission line risk assessment method for grid-ignited wildfires, identifying the transmission lines that could potentially lead to damage to the natural and built environment and to other transmission lines if igniting a wildfire. Grid, meteorological, and topological datasets are combined to enable a comprehensive analysis. Numerical analysis on the standard IEEE 30-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC).

The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system.

Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics.

Numerical methods were devised to calculate\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations.

         "  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy\nobservations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n",

Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n",

         "  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential\nequations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth\nfinite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n",

Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\n",

We study the possibility\nof detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through\nmodulation effects in the $\\bar\\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock\nwaves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron\nfraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible\ndetectability of the neutronization $\\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\\bar\\nu_e$\nspectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant\nconversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for\nvery small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\\times 10^{-5}$.\n",

         "  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete\ndipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are\nbounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when\nthe latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n",

In general, they do the\nsame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\nand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\nof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\nquantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)\nbased on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy \"trimming\") and (ii)\nbased on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\npossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\n1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\ncavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\nAll limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\nquasiequilibria.\n",

         "  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

         "  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n",

Locator performance was\ntested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of\nlocation depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the\ndimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location\naccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by\nthe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the\nintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is\navoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft\nframe structures by the acoustic emission method.\n",

         "Repair of DNA damage is essential for genome integrity. DNA damage elicits a DNA damage response (DDR) that includes error-free and error-prone, i.e. mutagenic, repair. The SOS response is a widely conserved system in bacteria that regulates the DDR and depends on the recombinase RecA and the transcriptional repressor LexA. However, RecA/LexA-independent DDRs have been identified in several bacterial species. Here, using a whole-cell, label-free quantitative proteomics approach, we map the proteomic response in Myxococcus xanthus to mitomycin C treatment and the lack of LexA. In doing so, we confirm a LexA-independent DDR in M. xanthus. Using a candidate approach, we identify DdiA, a transcriptional regulator of the XRE family, and demonstrate that it regulates a subset of the LexA-independent DDR genes. ddiA is expressed heterogeneously in a subpopulation of cells in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress and reversibly induced population-wide in response to such stress. DdiA, indirectly or directly, activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Accordingly, the ΔddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, suggesting that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis. We speculate that the DdiA-dependent response is tailored to counter replication stress, thereby preventing the induction of the complete RecA/LexA-dependent DDR in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress. Importance DNA damage repair is essential for genome integrity and depends on the DNA damage response (DDR). While the RecA/LexA-dependent SOS response is widely conserved in bacteria, there are also RecA/LexA-independent DDRs. Here, we identify the DNA damage-induced transcriptional regulator DdiA in Myxococcus xanthus and demonstrate that it regulates part of the RecA/LexA-independent DDR. DdiA activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Because the ΔddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, we suggest that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis and that the DdiA-dependent DDR is specifically tailored to counter replication stress.",

         "Irregular codes are bottlenecked by memory and communication latency. Decoupled access/execute (DAE) is a common technique to tackle this problem. It relies on the compiler to separate memory address generation from the rest of the program, however, such a separation is not always possible due to control and data dependencies between the access and execute slices, resulting in a loss of decoupling. In this paper, we present compiler support for speculation in DAE architectures that preserves decoupling in the face of control dependencies. We speculate memory requests in the access slice and poison mis-speculations in the execute slice without the need for replays or synchronization. Our transformation works on arbitrary, reducible control flow and is proven to preserve sequential consistency. We show that our approach applies to a wide range of architectural work on CPU/GPU prefetchers, CGRAs, and accelerators, enabling DAE on a wider range of codes than before.",

Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation in vivo, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active versus inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor. This study 1) highlights the role of cholesterol in regulating GLP-1R responses in vivo; 2) provides a detailed map of GLP-1R - cholesterol binding sites in model membranes; 3) validates their functional relevance in beta cells; and 4) highlights their potential as locations for the rational design of novel allosteric modulators with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R responses.",

In practical scenarios, anytime algorithms are preferred for their ability to quickly generate initial motions and continuously refine them over time. In this letter, we present an algorithmic framework that adapts common graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms to be anytime and enhances their efficiency and effectiveness. Our key insight is to identify guide paths that approximately track the reference trajectory and strategically bias sampling toward the guide paths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by restructuring two existing graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms and evaluating the updated algorithms in three experiments.",

         "Disrupted intestinal epithelial barrier function has been proposed to be integral to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression and pathogenesis. To further define the molecular pathways in synovial inflammation and the response of the intestinal tissues, we have used a rat model of mono-joint inflammatory arthritis, induced by intra-articular injection of Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). The predominant inflammatory response of a single injection of the adjuvant into the knee joint resulted in rapid and reproducible formation of a fibrotic myeloid-infiltrated synovial pannus. Our aim was to determine how intestinal tissues, including the proximal and distal ileum and distal colon, responded to inflammatory changes in the synovium in a temporally coordinated manner by comparing their transcriptomic landscapes using RNASeq analyses. We confirmed the timeline of joint inflammation by knee joint swelling measurement, increased synovial fluid levels of bikunin (a component of both the acute phase protein pre-alpha-inhibitor and inter-alpha-inhibitor) and demonstrated a self-correcting response of trabecular and cortical bone to the CFA challenge. Intestine-specific responses were monitored by 16S microbiome amplicon sequencing, histopathology for mucus layer integrity, and immune cell immunohistochemistry. We present data that shows the intestinal tissue displays an allostatic response to the acute joint inflammation and was region specific. The ileum primarily responded with increased mucus secretion and silencing of T-cell specific pathways, whereas the colon showed a transient upregulation of macrophages, with a broader suppression of immune related and metabolic pathway related transcripts. Interestingly, many neuropathways were activated early but then suppressed later in both the ileum and colon. There were only insignificant changes in the fecal microbiome composition in ileum or colon post-CFA administration. In summary, our data show for the first time a suppression of intestinal inflammatory and immune responses following the induction of joint inflammation and only minimal and transient changes in the microbiome. The results help clarify the molecular responses of intestinal tissues to inflammatory stresses that accompany the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint diseases.",

         "Motivational theories of imitation state that we imitate because this led to positive social consequences in the past. Because movement imitation typically only leads to these consequences when perceived by the imitated person, it should increase when the interaction partner sees the imitator. Current evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, potentially due to the low ecological validity in previous studies. We conducted two experiments (NExperiment 1 = 94, NExperiment 2 = 110) in which we resolved this limitation by placing participants in a virtual environment with a seeing and a blindfolded virtual agent, where they reacted to auditory cues with a head movement to the left or right, while the agent(s) also made a left or right head movement. We tested the effect of model eyesight (Experiments 1 and 2) and social reward on imitation (Experiment 2). Data were collected in 2023 and 2024. As expected, participants tended to imitate the agents. However, we found only limited evidence for the effect of model eyesight on automatic imitation in Experiment 1 and no evidence for the effect of model eyesight or social reward in Experiment 2. These findings challenge claims made by motivational theories. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

         "Research on microbial communities colonizing animals has revealed that the microbiota, despite its typical containment to surfaces, influences virtually all organ systems of the host. In absence of a natural microbiota, the host’s development can be disturbed, but how developmental programs are affected by the microbiota is still poorly understood. Removing the microbiota from Hydra, a classic model animal in developmental biology, causes drastic developmental malformations and leads to polyps that temporarily lack the ability to bud. Recolonizing non-budding germfree Hydra with bacteria reverses this budding inhibition. Single-nucleus ATAC-seq detected a unique chromatin landscape associated with the non-budding phenotype. Single-cell RNA-seq and trajectory-based differential expression analysis showed that epithelial stem cell decision making is disturbed in non-budding polyps, whereby key developmental regulators are not expressed. This process is reversible by adding back bacteria. Transcriptionally silencing of one of the genes that failed to be activated in non-budding animals, GAPR1, led to polyps that have a significantly reduced budding capacity. The results show that maintaining a species-specific microbiota may enable the animal host to maintain its developmental program. Significance Statement Animal developmental programs work within the context of coevolved associations with microbes. Here, we provide mechanistic evidence of the involvement of the microbiota in maintaining the pattern formation program of Hydra with the asexual formation of buds in the lower part of the body column. We demonstrate that in the absence of bacteria both the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape is changed and that key regulatory factors are not expressed, causing changes in stem cell trajectories that result in loss of budding capacity. This study provides a new perspective on the role that microbiota plays during animal development and evolution.

         "Background The regulatory network that coordinates gene expression ultimately determines the phenotype of an organism. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators involved in key biological processes. Lineage-specific losses of multiple miRNA families are rare, and reported cases of multiple miRNA losses coincide with significant changes in gene regulation resulting in body plan modifications. Recently, 15 mammalian miRNA families were found to be missing in the Eumuroidea, the rodent lineage that includes the model organisms mouse and rat. However, the impact of their absence on the gene regulatory networks in this lineage remains unknown. Results The in silico characterization of all 15 miRNAs revealed that their absence is best explained by multiple independent losses. Analyzing their target genes in humans reveals a significant enrichment of GO- terms linked to cellular and developmental processes. Overexpressing two of the co-absent miRNAs, Mir-197 and Mir-769, in human and mouse inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) resulted in significantly perturbed expression patterns in both species. In silico target site prediction revealed a significant enrichment of direct targets exclusively in the down-regulated genes. Four genes were down-regulated in both mouse and human and maximum parsimony suggests that the corresponding miRNA target sites were already present in the last common ancestor of mammals. The response of these genes to miRNA overexpression in mice, therefore, unveils remnants of the ancient gene regulatory network that have persisted until today. The evolutionary age of these regulatory connections provides initial evidence that the miRNA losses in Eumuroidea must have had consequences for the regulation of gene expression. Notably, we show that the miRNA loss in the Eumuroidea coincides with the largest lineage-specific loss of transcription factors within the mammals. Conclusions The impact of miRNA losses has thus far been investigated on a gene-by-gene basis. Our findings indicate that cooperative effects between miRNAs should be considered when assessing the impact of miRNA loss. We provide evidence that the Eumuroidea have modified their gene regulatory networks on two levels, transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. It will now be interesting to precisely chart the differences in gene regulation and assess their combined impact on the suitability of mice and rats as model systems for human disease.",

         "Despite the major role of nurseries in raising young plants and trees prior to transplantation, not enough is known about how the nursery climate impacts the growth and development of plants from germination through to maturity. It is important for forestry practitioners to understand the effect that different nursery environments may have on early stage growth as these may exceed differences due to genetic variation and can confound the use of early stage traits for selection. Here, a replicated progeny-provenance experiment of the economically and ecologically important species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was established in three environmentally distinct nurseries in Scotland and traits including survival, growth, form and phenology were measured. Temperature variation and photoperiod were the only uncontrolled environmental variables during this period, and their effect on measured traits was found to be significant among nurseries from the first growing season onwards. Trait interactions were not consistent between nurseries, indicating that the effectiveness of using proxy traits to select for desirable characteristics may depend on the environment in which the trees are grown. This study is the first in a series that will examine trait variation in Scots pine from seedlings to mature trees and highlights the importance of carefully considering and accounting for the nursery environment when growing trees for subsequent transplantation.",

         "Purpose Diffusion MRI (dMRI) data typically suffer of significant cross-site variability, which prevents naively performing pooled analyses. To attenuate cross-site variability, harmonization methods such as the rotational invariant spherical harmonics (RISH) have been introduced to harmonize the dMRI data at the signal level. A common requirement of the RISH method, is the availability of healthy individuals who are matched at the group level, which may not always be readily available, particularly retrospectively. In this work, we propose a framework to harmonize dMRI without matched training groups. Methods Our framework learns harmonization features while controlling for potential covariates using a voxel-based generalized linear model (RISH-GLM). RISH-GLM allows to simultaneously harmonize data from any number of sites while also accounting for covariates of interest, thus not requiring matched training subjects. Additionally, RISH-GLM can harmonize data from multiple sites in a single step, whereas RISH is performed for each site independently. Results We considered data of training subjects from retrospective cohorts acquired with 3 different scanners and performed 3 harmonization experiments of increasing complexity. First, we demonstrate that RISH-GLM is equivalent to conventional RISH when trained with data of matched training subjects. Secondly, we demonstrate that RISH-GLM can effectively learn harmonization with two groups of highly unmatched subjects. Thirdly, we evaluate the ability of RISH-GLM to simultaneously harmonize data from 3 different sites. Discussion RISH-GLM can learn cross-site harmonization both from matched and unmatched groups of training subjects, and can effectively be used to harmonize data of multiple sites in one single step.",

         "Autophagy plays a key role in the responses to different stress condition in plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are common modulators of stress responses, having both toxic and signaling functions. In this context, the relationship between ROS and autophagy regulation remains unclear, and in some aspects, contradictory. In this study, we employed pharmacological and genetic approaches to investigate the effects of different ROS on the cytoplastic redox state and autophagic flux in Arabidopsis thaliana. Ours results demonstrated that oxidative treatments with H2O2 and MV, which drastically increased the oxidized state of the cytoplasm, reduced the autophagic flux. Conversely, singlet oxygen, which did not have significant effects on the cytoplasmic redox state, increased the autophagic flux. Additionally, our findings indicated that after H2O2 and high light treatments and during the recovery period, the cytoplasm returned to its reduced state, while autophagy was markedly induced. In summary, our study unveils the differential effects of ROS on the autophagic flux, establishing a correlation with the redox state of the cytoplasm. Moreover, it emphasizes the dynamic nature of autophagy in response to oxidative stress and the subsequent recovery period. HIGHLIGHTS This research shows the differential effects of reactive oxygen species on autophagic modulation, highlighting their impact on the cytoplasmic redox state. The relationship between ROS and autophagy regulation remains unclear, and in some aspect’s contradictory. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation characterizing the effects of different ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen, on the modulation of autophagy in Arabidopsis. In brief, our findings reveal differential impacts on cytoplasmic redox states and autophagic flux, providing insight into the dynamic nature of autophagy, especially in stress and post-stress conditions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to evaluate autophagic flux both during and after oxidative stress in plants. Our results indicate that this differentiation is crucial when analyzing the effects of oxidative stress on autophagy.",

         "Logic locking has emerged to prevent piracy and overproduction of integrated circuits ever since the split of the design house and manufacturing foundry was established. While there has been a lot of research using a single global key to lock the circuit, even the most sophisticated single-key locking methods have been shown to be vulnerable to powerful SAT-based oracle-guided attacks that can extract the correct key with the help of an activated chip bought off the market and the locked netlist leaked from the untrusted foundry. To address this challenge, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel logic locking method called K-Gate Lock that encodes input patterns using multiple keys that are applied to one set of key inputs at different operational times. Our comprehensive experimental results confirm that using multiple keys will make the circuit secure against oracle-guided attacks and increase attacker efforts to an exponentially time-consuming brute force search. K-Gate Lock has reasonable power and performance overheads, making it a practical solution for real-world hardware intellectual property protection.",

         "Silver(I) ions and organometallic complexes thereof are well established antimicrobial agents. They have been employed in medical applications for centuries. It is also known that some bacteria can resist to silver(I) treatments through an efflux mechanism. However, the exact mechanism of action remains unclear. All-atom force-field simulations can provide valuable structural and thermodynamic insights on the molecular processes of the underlying mechanism. Lennard-Jones parameters of silver(I) have been available for quite some time; their applicability to describe properly the binding properties (affinity, binding distance) between silver(I) and peptide-based binding motifs is, however, still an open question. Here, we demonstrate that the standard 12-6 Lennard-Jones parameters (previously developed to describe the hydration free energy with the TIP3P water model) significantly underestimate the interaction strength between silver(I) and both methionine and histidine. These are two key amino-acid residues in silver(I)-binding motifs of proteins involved in the efflux process. Using free-energy calculations, we calibrated non-bonded fix (NBFIX) parameters for the CHARMM36m force field to reproduce the experimental binding constant between amino acid sidechain fragments and silver(I) ions. We then successfully validated the new parameters on a set of small silver-binding peptides with experimentally known binding constants. In addition, we could monitor how silver(I) ions increase the α-helical content of the LP1 oligopeptide, in agreement with previously reported Circular Dichroism (CD) experiments. Future improvements are outlined. The implementation of these new parameters is straightforward in all simulation packages that can use the CHARMM36m force field. It sets the stage for the modeling community to study more complex silver(I)-binding processes such as the interaction with silver(I)-binding-transporter proteins.",

         "Existing models of human growth provide little insight into underlying mechanisms responsible for inter-individual and inter-population variation in children’s growth trajectories. Building on general theories linking growth to metabolic rates, we develop a causal parametric model of height and weight growth incorporating a representation of human body allometry and a process-partitioned representation of ontogeny. This model permits separation of metabolic causes of growth variation, potentially influenced by nutrition and disease, from allometric factors, potentially under stronger genetic control. We estimate model parameters using a Bayesian multilevel statistical design applied to temporally-dense height and weight measurements of U.S. children, and temporally-sparse measurements of Indigenous Amazonian children. This facilitates a comparison of the contributions of metabolism and allometry to observed cross-cultural variation in the growth trajectories of the two populations, and permits simulation of the effects of healthcare interventions on growth. This theoretical model provides a new framework for exploring the causes of growth variation in our species, while potentially guiding the development of appropriate, and desired, healthcare interventions in societies confronting growth-related health challenges, such as malnutrition and stunting.",

         "Higher-order ambisonic rendering is an increasingly common soundscape reproduction technique that, in theory, enables presentation of virtual sounds at nearly any location in 3D space, relatively unconstrained by the veridical locations of loudspeakers. We evaluated whether 3D sound reproduction through a 9th-order ambisonic loudspeaker array was indeed sufficiently accurate to probe the limits of human spatial perception. We first estimated minimum audible angles for human listeners for a variety of reference points on the horizontal plane. We demonstrated that the system can reproduce sounds with a spatial resolution that is equal or superior to the limits of human acuity, at least on the horizontal plane at the front. Importantly, the resolution of ambisonic reproduction appeared equivalent for regions of the system with high and low loudspeaker density. We also estimated localization cues at the same locations and showed that although localization cues for low-frequency components were well preserved, they were somewhat distorted for components above 4000 Hz. Finally, we provide evidence that these high-frequency distortions can serve elevation cues by human listeners. In summary, we showed that a 9th order ambisonic system is able to render highly focal sound sources, and that high-frequency reproduction distortions may introduce unwanted localization cues.",

         "This study presents a novel approach to examining the psychological impact of emerging technologies through the development of a Hype Cycle Model (HCM), utilizing sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Focusing on electric vehicles, we investigate how public sentiment—captured via social media comments—reflects the psychological effects of technology adoption and hype. Our model integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses, utilizing sentiment scoring and topic modeling to explore thematic psychological trends. An analysis of approximately 43,000 social media comments on electric vehicles demonstrated that the integration of expert knowledge with public sentiment provides a comprehensive understanding of technology hype dynamics. The results revealed that sentiment analysis enables real-time tracking of emotional responses to emerging technologies, while Correlated Topic Modeling (CTM) offers contextual insights into the positioning of technologies within the HCM. These findings demonstrate that understanding public sentiment towards emerging technologies can provide valuable insights for both organizations and policymakers in technology forecasting and adoption planning. Our approach transforms the traditional black box implementation by Gartner Inc. into a transparent framework that illuminates the psychological underpinnings of technology hype, revealing how collective excitement, expectations, and emotional responses shape the trajectory of emerging technology adoption.",

         "Contamination is one of the major threats to freshwater biodiversity. Compared to other aquatic ecosystems, peri-urban ponds are unique because they are embedded in human-dominated areas. However, it is poorly understood how different land uses such as urban or agricultural contribute multiple pollutants to ponds and thus affect pond biodiversity. In this work, 12 ponds located in a peri-urban area (Ile-de-France region, France) were monitored for 2 consecutive years in spring and fall. We surveyed macroinvertebrates and measured the physicochemical parameters and contaminants of different classes (trace elements, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in both water and sediment. The objective was twofold: (1) to explore local and regional macroinvertebrate spatiotemporal diversity and (2) to understand the effects of contaminants on community structure. We observed 236 macroinvertebrate morphotaxa, none of which were rare or sensitive to pollutants. Morphotaxa richness showed small differences between ponds but no difference between there was no effect of field campaign. There was no effect of ponds and field campaign on morphotaxa diversity and equitability. We did not observe a relationship between land use around the pond (agricultural, urban, or semi-natural) and diversity indices with the exception of the proportion of agricultural land in the vicinity of the pond on equitability. Regional beta diversity (between ponds) showed that differences in morphotaxa composition reflected species replacement more than differences in species richness; these were primarily due to the high abundance of pollutant-tolerant species in some of the ponds. The effects of environmental parameters on community structure were studied using partial redundancy analysis based on the presence-absence of morphotaxa, showing that community assemblages are shaped by sediment levels of pharmaceuticals, water conductivity and ammonium concentration. In conclusion, ponds in peri-urban areas are exposed to various human activities, with our results suggesting that this exposure leads to chronic and diverse contaminations that affect morphotaxa communities.",

         "Understanding population structure is essential for conservation genetics, as it provides insights into population connectivity and supports the development of targeted strategies to preserve genetic diversity and adaptability. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) have proven effective for revealing population genetic structures in human and model organisms using hard-called genotypes, but their application in wild species using genotype likelihoods from low coverage sequencing (as a cost-saving measure) remains underexplored. Here, we present a Jupyter Notebook-based workflow that facilitates the use of UMAP and t-SNE on genotype likelihood-derived principal components. This workflow is demonstrated using medium to low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data from scimitar-horned oryx, which has been reintroduced into the wild and faces multiple conservation challenges. Detailed guidance on hyperparameter tuning and practical implementation is also provided, enhancing the application of these methods in wildlife genetics to potentially support biodiversity conservation.",

         "Background Patients with gastric cancer (GC) are prone to lymph node metastasis (LNM), which is an important factor for recurrence and poor prognosis of GC. Nowadays, more and more studies have confirmed that exosomes can participate in tumor lymphangiogenesis. An in-depth exploration of the pathological mechanism in the process of LNM in GC may provide effective targets and improve the diagnosis and treatment effect. Materials and Methods We used sequencing analysis of collected serum to screen out exo-miRNA related to LNM in GC. ELISA, qRT-PCR, Western Blot, RNA pull-down assay, Transwell assay, animal experiments, and other experiments were used to verify the results. Results In this study, we screened out miR-224-3p related to GC progression and LNM in a vascular endothelial growth Factor C (VEGFC)-independent manner. We found that exo-miR-224-3p derived from GC cells could enter human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) and promote the tube formation and migration of HLECs. In addition, it was revealed that miR-224-3p could bind to the 3′UTR region of GSK3B mRNA. Then, we proved that inhibiting the expression of GSK3B could suppress the phosphorylation of β-catenin and promote the transcription of PROX1, thus leading to tumor lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, it was also found that hnRNPA1 mediated the sorting of miR-224-3p into exosomes, and the high expression of PKM2 promoted the secretion of exo-miR-224-3p. Conclusions Our discovery of the exo-miR-224-3p/GSK3B/β-catenin/PROX1 axis may provide a new direction for the clinical treatment of GC.",

         "High mobility environment leads to severe Doppler effects and poses serious challenges to the conventional physical layer based on the widely popular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The recent emergence of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, along with its many related variants, presents a promising solution to overcome such channel Doppler effects. This paper aims to clearly establish the relationships among the various manifestations of OTFS. Among these related modulations, we identify their connections, common features, and distinctions. Building on existing works, this work provides a general overview of various OTFS-related detection schemes and performance comparisons. We first provide an overview of OFDM and filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) by demonstrating OTFS as a precoded FBMC through the introduction of inverse symplectic finite Fourier transform (ISFFT). We explore the relationship between OTFS and related modulation schemes with similar characteristics. We provide an effective channel model for high-mobility channels and offer a unified detection representation. We provide numerical comparisons of power spectrum density (PSD) and bit error rate (BER) to underscore the benefit of these modulation schemes in high-mobility scenarios. We also evaluate various detection schemes, revealing insights into their efficacies. We discuss opportunities and challenges for OTFS in high mobility, setting the stage for future research and development in this field.",

         "The structural basis for the pharmacology of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the most abundant membrane proteins and the target of about 35% of approved drugs, is still a matter of intense study. What makes GPCRs challenging to study is the inherent flexibility and the metastable nature of interaction with extra-and intracellular partners that drive their effects. Here, we present a molecular dynamics (MD) adaptive sampling algorithm, namely multiple walker supervised molecular dynamics (mwSuMD), to address complex structural transitions involving GPCRs without energy input. We first report the binding and unbinding of the vasopressin peptide from its receptor V2. Successively, we present the complete transition of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) from inactive to active, agonist and Gs-bound state, and the GDP release from Gs. To our knowledge, this is the first time the whole sequence of events leading from an inactive GPCR to the GDP release is simulated without any energy bias. We demonstrate that mwSuMD can address complex binding processes intrinsically linked to protein dynamics out of reach of classic MD.",

         "During brain development, synapses are initially formed in excess and are later eliminated in an activity-dependent manner. Weak synapses are preferentially removed, but the mechanism linking neuronal activity to synapse removal is unclear. Here we show that, in the developing mouse visual pathway, inhibiting synaptic transmission induces postsynaptic activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 deficiency results in defects in synapse elimination driven by both spontaneous and experience-dependent neural activity. Notably, caspase-3 deficiency blocks activity-dependent synapse elimination, as evidenced by reduced engulfment of inactive synapses by microglia. Furthermore, in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, caspase-3 deficiency protects against synapse loss induced by amyloid-β deposition. Our results reveal caspase-3 activation as a key step in activity-dependent synapse elimination during development and synapse loss in neurodegeneration.",

         "In the pursuit of replicating biological processes at the nanoscale, controlling cellular membrane dynamics has emerged as a key area of interest. Here, we report a system mimicking virus assembly to control directional membrane budding. We employ three-dimensional DNA origami techniques to construct cholesterol-modified triangles that self-assemble into polyhedral shells on lipid vesicles, resulting in gradual curvature induction, bud formation and spontaneous neck scission. Strategic positioning of cholesterols on the triangle surface provides control over the directionality of bud growth and yields daughter vesicles with DNA endo- or exoskeletons reminiscent of clathrin-coated vesicles. This process occurs with rapid kinetics and across various lipid compositions. When combined into a two-step process, nested bivesicular objects with DNA shells encapsulated between lipid vesicles could be produced. Our work replicates key aspects of natural endocytic and exocytic pathways, opening new avenues for exploring membrane mechanics and applications in targeted drug delivery and synthetic biology.",

         "Marine plankton communities consist of numerous species, and their composition and physiological states are closely linked to ecosystem functions. Understanding biogeochemical cycles requires measuring taxon-specific mortality due to viral lysis or sloppy feeding, as the dissolved organic matter released contributes to rapid nutrient recycling and long-term carbon sequestration following microbial transformation. This study introduces a quantitative and comprehensive analysis of microeukaryotes in the dissolved constituents of seawater by using Mortality by Ribosomal Sequencing (MoRS) method. Our experimental pipeline successfully recovered 83% of cell-free rRNA. The ratio of cell-free rRNA to cell-associated rRNA was more than 10-fold higher in the mesopelagic layer than in the upper epipelagic layer, suggesting the mesopelagic zone as a hotspot for eukaryotic cell lysis. Many protist lineages, including phytoplankton such as haptophytes, are less susceptible to cell lysis in the epipelagic layer yet are actively lysed in the mesopelagic zone. Notably, over 86% of the significantly lysed species in the mesopelagic layer showed a habitat preference for the epipelagic layer. These findings indicate that sinking from the surface and lysis in the mesopelagic are prevalent dynamics for various eukaryotes.",

         "“Open ended” or “dark taxa” are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with low-cost DNA barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of taxonomic revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the Mycetophilidae fungus gnats (Diptera) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 samples collected with 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 sites in different habitats in Singapore: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for 1,454 specimens, we delimit 120 species of 23 genera. Of these, only five were species previously described. The remaining 115 species are new to science and described here. We name, however, only 98 of these species since 14 species are currently only known from females and we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis (Manota spp. A–G and Neoempheria spp. A–G), and three species lack molecular data (Epicypta sp. A, Epicypta sp. B, and Neoempheria sp. H). To assess congruence between species delimited with DNA barcodes (3% clusters) and morphology, we determined a match ratio and found it to be overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for MOTUs clustered at 5% with Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD set to (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 20:1. Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by about 25%, highlighting the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three genera—Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus— Integricypta, gen. n., which is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless—belonging to the Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini based on three species. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Søli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula), and Chalastonepsia hokkaidensis Kallweit a species spread in east Asia. The mycomyine genus Vecella Wu & Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu & Yang), n. comb. corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of Parempheriella. Barcodes for a second set of 1,493 Singapore mycetophilid specimens suggest the presence of an additional 18 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the Singapore species that routinely enter Malaise traps are identified or described here. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula. Zusammenfassung “Open-ended” oder “Dark Taxa” sind artenreiche Klade, die so abundant und arteinreich sind, dass die herkömmlichen taxonomischen Methoden angesichts der großen Anzahl von Exemplaren und Arten nicht gut funktionieren. Neue Ansätze, die auf das Vorsortierung von Exemplaren mit DNA Barcodes bis zum Artniveau basieren, erlauben es jetzt aber solche Taxa zu revidieren. Allerdings kann auch mit DNA Barcodes, nur die Fauna eines vergleichsweise kleinen Gebietes bearbeiten werden, weil für die meisten Länder und biogeografischen Regionen zu viele Exemplare und Arten abgedeckt werden müssten. Wir demonstrieren hier wie eine solche Revision durchgeführt werden kann. Wir revidieren hier die Pilzmücken (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) von Singapur, die mit Malaisefallen gefangen werden können. Das hier überarbeitete Material stammt aus 496 Malaise-Fallenproben, die mit 71 Malaise-Fallen an 107 Sammelstellen in verschiedenen Habitaten gefangen wurden: Mangroven, Sumpfwälder, Süßwassersümpfe, Primärregenwälder und Sekundärwälder. Basierend auf molekularen und morphologischen Daten für mehr als 1454 Tiere grenzen wir 120 Arten mit molekularen und morphologischen Daten ab, wobei nur 5 dieser Arten bereits beschrieben sind. Die verbleibenden 115 werden hier beschrieben. Allerdings benennen wir nur 98 Arten, da für zwei Arten molekulare Daten fehlen und für 14 weitere Arten derzeit nur Weibchen bekannt sind. Daher können wir derzeit keine zufriedenstellende morphologische Diagnose erstellen. Darüber hinaus fehlen molekulare Daten für drei Arten (Epicypta sp. A, Epicypta sp. B und Neoempheria sp. H). Was die Artgrenzen betrifft, so stimmen die molekularen und morphologischen Daten in den meisten Fällen überein (match ratio: 95% für 3% MOTUs). Eine noch höhere „match ratio“ von 99% wird für 5% und ABGD MOTUs (P=0,060) beobachtet. Insgesamt ist das Verhältnis zwischen unbeschrieben und beschrieben erstaunlich hoch (20:1), und die Überarbeitung der singapurer Fauna erhöht die Anzahl der beschriebenen Arten in der Orientalischen Region um über 25%. Dies unterstreicht den Ausmaß des „taxonomic impediments“ für Pilzmücken. Die meisten der Mycetophilidenarten in Singapur gehören zu drei von 22 Gattungen - Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 Arten), Epicypta Winnertz (29 Arten) und Manota Williston (14 Arten), aber wir beschreiben hier auch eine neue Gattung, Integricypta, gen. n. basierend auf drei Arten. Die Gattung gehört zu den Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini und ist die mutmaßliche Schwestergruppe von Aspidionia Colless. Die sequenzierten, illustrierten und benannten Arten sind: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

         "Understanding neural activity organization is vital for deciphering brain function. By recording whole-brain calcium activity in larval zebrafish during hunting and spontaneous behaviors, we find that the shape of the neural activity space, described by the neural covariance spectrum, is scale-invariant: a smaller, randomly sampled cell assembly resembles the entire brain. This phenomenon can be explained by Euclidean Random Matrix theory, where neurons are reorganized from anatomical to functional positions based on their correlations. Three factors contribute to the observed scale invariance: slow neural correlation decay, higher functional space dimension, and neural activity heterogeneity. In addition to matching data from zebrafish and mice, our theory and analysis demonstrate how the geometry of neural activity space evolves with population sizes and sampling methods, thus revealing an organizing principle of brain-wide activity.",

         "Genotype-phenotype mapping (GPM), or the association of trait variation to genetic variation, has been a long-lasting problem in biology. The existing approaches to this problem allowed researchers to partially understand within– and between-species variation as well as the emergence or evolution of phenotypes. However, traditional GPM methods typically ignore the transcriptome or have low statistical power due to challenges related to dataset scale. Thus, it is not clear to what extent selection modulates transcriptomes and whether cis-or trans-regulatory elements are more important. To overcome these challenges, we leveraged the cost efficiency and scalability of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by collecting data from 18,233 yeast cells from 4,489 F2 segregants derived from an F1 cross between the laboratory strain BY4741 and the vineyard strain RM11-1a. More precisely, we performed eQTL mapping with the scRNA-seq data to identify single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) and transcriptome variation patterns associated with fitness variation inferred from the segregant bulk fitness assay. Due to the larger scale of our dataset and its multidimensionality, we could recapitulate results from decades of work in GPM from yeast bulk assays while revealing new associations between phenotypic and transcriptomic variations at a broad scale. We evaluated the strength of the association between phenotype variation and expression variation, revealed new hotspots of gene expression regulation associated to trait variation, revealed new gene function with high expression heritability and highlighted the larger aggregate effect of trans-regulation compared to cis-regulation Altogether these results suggest that integrating large-scale scRNA-seq data into GPM improves our understanding of trait variation in the context of transcriptomic regulation.",

         "During sleep, our brain undergoes highly synchronized activity, orchestrated by distinct neural rhythms. Little is known about the associated brain activation during these sleep rhythms, and even less about their functional implications. In this study, we investigated the brain-wide activation underlying human sleep rhythms by employing simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 107 participants during nocturnal nap (first half of the night). We identified robust coupling between slow oscillations (SOs) and fast spindles during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (N2/3 stages), with spindle peaks consistently occurring just before the SO UP-state. This SO-spindle coupling was linked to elevated activation in both the thalamus and hippocampus, alongside increased functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus and from the thalamus to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). An open-ended cognitive state decoding analysis suggested that these activations may relate to episodic memory processes, yet were distinct from task-related networks. Together, these findings highlight the thalamus as a key coordinator of hippocampal-cortical communication during sleep and provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronized sleep rhythms may support memory consolidation.",

         "Sponges, comprising over 9000 recorded species, represent one of the most primitive groups of metazoans. Given the importance of species distribution records and the identification of new species in scientific research, these endeavors play a crucial role in enhancing ecological insights, conserving biodiversity, facilitating a better understanding of the relationships between various groups of organisms, advancing our knowledge of evolution, and potentially expanding biomedical implications. In this study, we used basic morphological data, mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene, and Internal Transcribed Spacer two (ITS2) regions to evaluate the Terpios samples collected from four coastal sites along the northeastern Mediterranean Sea, covering a distance of approximately 450 km. For this purpose, 81 COI and 11 ITS2 records of the order Suberitida were mined from GenBank, and species delimitation analysis was performed using both the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery method and the Poisson Tree Process (PTP), along with 11 samples from the present study. While we observed slight differences in spicule sizes, the overall morphology of all samples from our study was similar. Within the scope of this research, we report the first-ever presence record of T. gelatinosus in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, we document evidence pointing to the potential existence of cryptic speciation in the region.",

         "Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) revolutionized genome editing by enabling programmable DNA cleavage guided by an RNA. However, SpCas9 tolerates mismatches in the DNA-RNA duplex, which can lead to deleterious off-target editing. Here, we reveal that Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9) possesses a unique structural feature—the REC3 clamp—that underlies its intrinsic high-fidelity DNA targeting. Through kinetic and structural analyses, we show that the REC3 clamp forms critical contacts with the PAM-distal region of the R-loop, thereby imposing a novel checkpoint during enzyme activation. Notably, F. novicida encodes a non-canonical small CRISPR-associated RNA (scaRNA) that enables FnCas9 to repress an endogenous bacterial lipoprotein gene, subverting host immune detection. Structures of FnCas9 with scaRNA illustrate how partial R-loop complementarity hinders REC3 clamp docking and prevents cleavage in favor of transcriptional repression. The REC3 clamp is conserved in type II-B CRISPR-Cas9 systems, pointing to a potential path for engineering precise genome editors or developing novel antibacterial strategies. These findings reveal the dual mechanisms of high specificity and virulence by FnCas9, with broad implications for biotechnology and therapeutic development. Graphical Abstract",

         "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic disease that poses significant economic burden and health risks. It is pivotal to better understand brain mechanisms engaged by alcohol that promote misuse. The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged as a key mediator of excessive preclinical alcohol consumption. A dynorphin-expressing subpopulation within the CeA (CeADyn) has been implicated in excessive alcohol drinking, yet how cellular activity of CeADyn neurons relates to ongoing alcohol drinking is not well-understood. The current study interrogated the engagement of CeADyn neurons in male and female mice during voluntary alcohol consumption using fiber photometry and compared this cellular response with that of other solutions having similar motivational and/or taste characteristics. Activity of a calcium sensor, GCaMP7f, expressed in mouse CeADyn neurons was recorded and time-locked to bouts of drinking. Multilevel linear mixed modeling was applied to better resolve focal effects from complex data. These analyses revealed a relatively large increase in CeADyn neuron calcium transients after bouts of alcohol drinking compared to water or sucrose drinking, indicating these neurons are uniquely engaged during alcohol consumption. Drinking behavior unique to alcohol (i.e., longer bout durations) did not fully explain signal differences between alcohol and other solutions nor did the relatively increased alcohol response diminish over time. No other conditions or solutions tested reproduced the pronounced change in CeADyn activity associated with alcohol drinking. These findings, collectively, support the presence of a unique functional signature for alcohol in a cell population known to control excessive alcohol drinking. Highlights Central amygdala dynorphin cells (CeADyn) are firmly implicated in alcohol misuse. CeADyn neuron activity was higher when mice drank alcohol versus other solutions. Neither how mice drank alcohol nor motivational states could explain this activity. CeADyn neurons having uniquely high alcohol responses may underlie AUD development.",

         "Transposable elements (TEs) are powerful drivers of genome evolution, in part through their ability to rapidly rewire the host regulatory network by creating transcription factor binding sites that can potentially be turned to the host’s advantage in a process called exaptation. However, the effects on the host phenotype vary widely among different TEs. Here, we classify TEs based on their contribution to the human host phenotypes at both molecular and macroscopic scales. TE contributions to chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and the heritability of complex traits are strongly correlated to each other, confirming that the main mechanism through which TEs affect the host phenotype is through the rewiring of the regulatory network. TE sequence and evolutionary features are able to explain a large fraction of the variance in phenotypic relevance, and in particular more than 50% of the variance of their contribution to the heritability of complex traits. A conspicuous exception to this pattern is represented by TEs of the ERV1 family, whose phenotypic impact cannot be explained by our model: In particular, this family includes a set of relatively young TEs whose phenotypic relevance is much larger than would be expected based on their sequence and evolutionary parameters. These TEs are involved in fast-evolving biological processes related to the interaction of the organism with its environment. In conclusion, our results confirm quantitatively that TE insertions affect the host phenotype mostly through the rewiring of its regulatory network; identify a signature of phenotypic relevance based on sequence and conservation properties; and highlight several TEs as promising candidates for functional studies.",

         "The Passive Optical Network (PON) has been evolving continuously in terms of architecture and capacity to keep up with the demand for high-speed Internet access in the access network segment. Recently, integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which provides programmable and (logically) centralized network control, with PON has attracted intensive research interest to further enhance PON performance and reduce operational and capital expenditure. Although PON is regarded as an energy-efficient access network solution, it would be a major contributor for increasing energy consumption in the access network segment because of its higher penetration rate than other access network technologies. Over the past several years, the major standardization bodies like IEEE and ITU-T, and research communities have engaged in introducing energy-efficient PON solutions. This article familiarizes readers with PON evolution in terms of capacity, architecture, and its integration with virtualization and SDN based control. We present a comprehensive survey of the energy conservation research efforts in PON starting from conventional PON to SDN based PON leveraging virtual and physical network functions. This article also presents contemporary energy-efficient standardization activities in IEEE and ITU-T. To the best of our knowledge, to date, this article is the first most comprehensive survey on energy saving research and standardization on PON. We summarize the lessons learned from the recent advancements, identify important challenges ahead and outline several future research directions that can contribute to further advancement of energy-efficient PON.",

Using the lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm), a serious agricultural pest, as a model, we determined that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) cadherin 96ca (CAD96CA) and fibroblast growth factor receptor homologue (FGFR1) function as JH cell membrane receptors by their roles in JH-regulated gene expression, larval status maintaining, rapid intracellular calcium increase, phosphorylation of JH intracellular receptor MET1 and cofactor Taiman, and high affinity to JH III. Gene knockout of Cad96ca and Fgfr1 by CRISPR/Cas9 in embryo and knockdown in various insect cells, and overexpression of CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mammalian HEK-293T cells all supported CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmitting JH signal as JH cell membrane receptors.",

         "Bursty gene expression is characterised by two intuitive parameters, burst frequency and burst size, the cell-cycle dependence of which has not been extensively profiled at the transcriptome level. In this study, we estimate the burst parameters per allele in the G1 and G2/M cell-cycle phases for thousands of mouse genes by fitting mechanistic models of gene expression to mRNA count data, obtained by sequencing of single cells whose cell-cycle position has been inferred using a deep-learning method. We find that upon DNA replication, the median burst frequency approximately halves, while the burst size remains mostly unchanged. Genome-wide distributions of the burst parameter ratios between the G2/M and G1 phases are wide, indicating substantial heterogeneity in transcriptional regulation patterns. We also observe a significant negative correlation between the burst frequency and size ratios, suggesting that regulatory processes do not independently control the burst parameters. Finally, we argue that to accurately estimate the burst parameter ratios, mechanistic models must explicitly account for gene copy number variation and extrinsic noise due to the coupling of transcription to cell age within the cell cycle, but corrections for technical noise due to imperfect capture of RNA molecules in sequencing experiments are less critical.",

         "Cancer cells display high levels of oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) and rely on DNA damage checkpoint for viability. This feature is exploited by cancer therapies to either increase RS to unbearable levels or inhibit checkpoint kinases involved in the DNA damage response. Thus far, treatments that combine these two strategies have shown promise but also have severe adverse effects. To identify novel, better-tolerated anticancer combinations, we screened a collection of plant extracts and found two natural compounds from the plant, Psoralea corylifolia, that synergistically inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Bakuchiol inhibited DNA replication and activated the checkpoint kinase CHK1 by targeting DNA polymerases. Isobavachalcone interfered with DNA double-strand break repair by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and DNA end resection. The combination of bakuchiol and isobavachalcone synergistically inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Importantly, it also prevented tumor development in xenografted NOD/SCID mice. The synergistic effect of inhibiting DNA replication and CHK2 signaling identifies a vulnerability of cancer cells that might be exploited by using clinically approved inhibitors in novel combination therapies.",

         "Long-read sequencing techniques can sequence transcripts from end to end, greatly improving our ability to study the transcription process. Although there are several well-established tools for long-read transcriptome analysis, most are reference-based. This limits the analysis of organisms without high-quality reference genomes and samples or genes with high variability (e.g., cancer samples or some gene families). In such settings, analysis using a reference-free method is favorable. The computational problem of clustering long reads by region of common origin is well-established for reference-free transcriptome analysis pipelines. Such clustering enables large datasets to be split up roughly by gene family and, therefore, an independent analysis of each cluster. There exist tools for this. However, none of those tools can efficiently process the large amount of reads that are now generated by long-read sequencing technologies. We present isONclust3, an improved algorithm over isONclust and isONclust2, to cluster massive long-read transcriptome datasets into gene families. Like isONclust, IsONclust3 represents each cluster with a set of minimizers. However, unlike other approaches, isONclust3 dynamically updates the cluster representation during clustering by adding high-confidence minimizers from new reads assigned to the cluster and employs an iterative cluster-merging step. We show that isONclust3 yields results with higher or comparable quality to state-of-the-art algorithms but is 10-100 times faster on large datasets. Also, using a 256Gb computing node, isONclust3 was the only tool that could cluster 37 million PacBio reads, which is a typical throughput of the recent PacBio Revio sequencing machine.

         "RNA metabolism is tightly regulated by cis-elements and trans-acting factors. Most information guiding such regulation is encoded in RNA sequences. Considering the similarities in semantic and syntactic features between RNAs and human language, we developed LAMAR, a transformer-based foundation language model for RNA regulation, to decipher general rules underlying RNA processing. The model was pretrained on approximately 15 million sequences from both genome and transcriptome of 225 mammals and 1569 viruses, and further fine-tuned with labeled datasets for various tasks. The resulting fine-tuned models outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in predicting mRNA translation efficiency and mRNA half-life, while achieving comparable accuracy to specifically designed methods in predicting splice sites of pre-mRNAs and internal ribosome entry sites. Our results indicated that a single foundation language model is applicable in the comprehensive analysis of different aspects of RNA regulation, providing new insight into the design and optimization of RNA drugs.",

         "Wildfires ignited by the power lines have become increasingly common over the past decade. Enhancing the operational and financial resilience of power grids against wildfires involves a multifaceted approach. Key proactive measures include meticulous vegetation management, strategic grid hardening such as infrastructure undergrounding, preemptive de-energization, and disaster risk financing, among others. Each measure should be tailored to prioritize efforts in mitigating the consequences of wildfires. This paper proposes a transmission line risk assessment method for grid-ignited wildfires, identifying the transmission lines that could potentially lead to damage to the natural and built environment and to other transmission lines if igniting a wildfire. Grid, meteorological, and topological datasets are combined to enable a comprehensive analysis. Numerical analysis on the standard IEEE 30-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

         "In earlier work, the Abstract State Machine Thesis -- that arbitrary\nalgorithms are behaviorally equivalent to abstract state machines -- was\nestablished for several classes of algorithms, including ordinary, interactive,\nsmall-step algorithms. This was accomplished on the basis of axiomatizations of\nthese classes of algorithms. In Part I (Interactive Small-Step Algorithms I:\nAxiomatization), the axiomatization was extended to cover interactive\nsmall-step algorithms that are not necessarily ordinary. This means that the\nalgorithms (1) can complete a step without necessarily waiting for replies to\nall queries from that step and (2) can use not only the environment's replies\nbut also the order in which the replies were received. In order to prove the\nthesis for algorithms of this generality, we extend here the definition of\nabstract state machines to incorporate explicit attention to the relative\ntiming of replies and to the possible absence of replies. We prove the\ncharacterization theorem for extended abstract state machines with respect to\ngeneral algorithms as axiomatized in Part I.",

         "Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a prominent specification formalism for\nreal-time systems. In this paper, we show that the satisfiability problem for\nMTL over finite timed words is decidable, with non-primitive recursive\ncomplexity. We also consider the model-checking problem for MTL: whether all\nwords accepted by a given Alur-Dill timed automaton satisfy a given MTL\nformula. We show that this problem is decidable over finite words. Over\ninfinite words, we show that model checking the safety fragment of MTL--which\nincludes invariance and time-bounded response properties--is also decidable.\nThese results are quite surprising in that they contradict various claims to\nthe contrary that have appeared in the literature.",

         "In a previous work Baillot and Terui introduced Dual light affine logic\n(DLAL) as a variant of Light linear logic suitable for guaranteeing complexity\nproperties on lambda calculus terms: all typable terms can be evaluated in\npolynomial time by beta reduction and all Ptime functions can be represented.\nIn the present work we address the problem of typing lambda-terms in\nsecond-order DLAL. For that we give a procedure which, starting with a term\ntyped in system F, determines whether it is typable in DLAL and outputs a\nconcrete typing if there exists any. We show that our procedure can be run in\ntime polynomial in the size of the original Church typed system F term.",

         "This paper documents a study, carried out in the academic year 2003-2004, on fifteen factors that may influence performance on a first year object-oriented programming module. The factors included prior academic experience, prior computer experience, self-perception of programming performance and comfort level on the module and specific cognitive skills. The study found that a student's perception of their understanding of the module had the strongest correlation with programming performance, r=0.76, p‹0.01. In addition, Leaving Certificate (LC) mathematics and science scores were shown to have a strong correlation with performance. A regression module, based upon a student's perception of their understanding of the module, gender, LC mathematics score and comfort level was able to account for 79% of the variance in programming performance results.",

         "Objective—The high and low responder phenomenon describes individual differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) activity. We characterized patterns of intracellular accumulation, externalization, and shedding of TF in response to LPS in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). Methods and Results—After 2 hours of LPS stimulation of whole blood, flow cytometry analyses revealed a larger population of TF-positive monocytes in HRs (32.0±3.5%) versus LRs (11.2±1.2%; P≤0.05), along with a stronger mean fluorescence intensity of TF signal in HRs (7.1±0.5 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with LRs (5.4±0.4 AU; P≤0.05). The LPS-treated blood of the HR group contained 2-fold more TF-positive microparticles than LRs. In-cell Western assay demonstrated higher intracellular accumulation of TF in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from LRs because LPS induced a 3.7-fold increase of total TF levels in LRs versus a 1.5-fold increase in HRs. In contrast, in response to LPS stimulation, MNCs from HRs exhibited a 4-fold induction of surface TF, whereas MNCs from LRs only had a minor increase in surface TF levels. Conclusions—The higher availability of surface TF antigen on MNCs from HRs and TF-containing microparticles might make these individuals more susceptible to hypercoagulation.",

         "We present an encoding framework which exploits semantics for video content delivery. The video content is organized based on the idea of main content message. In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.",

         "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

         "Abstract Laboratory natural selection and artificial selection are vital tools for addressing specific questions about evolutionary patterns of variation. Laboratory natural selection can illuminate whether a putative selective agent is capable of generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits and the extent to which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss theoretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken beyond model organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation.",

         "The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events. We recorded neurons from the basolateral complex of two monkeys while they performed visually cued schedules of sequential color discrimination trials, with both valid and random cues. When the cues were valid, the visual cue, which was present throughout each trial, indicated how many trials remained to be successfully completed before a reward. Seventy-six percent of recorded neurons showed response selectivity, with the selectivity depending on some aspects of the current schedule. After a reward, when the monkeys knew that the upcoming cue would be valid, 88 of 246 (36%) neurons responded between schedules, seemingly anticipating the receiving information about the upcoming schedule length. When the cue appeared, 102 of 246 (41%) neurons became selective, at this point encoding information about whether the current trial was the only trial required or how many more trials are needed to obtain a reward. These cue-related responses had a median latency of 120 ms (just between the latencies in inferior temporal visual area TE and perirhinal cortex). When the monkey was releasing a touch bar to complete the trial correctly, 71 of 246 (29%) neurons responded, with responses in the rewarded trials being similar no matter which schedule was ending, thus being sensitive to the reward contingency. Finally, 39 of 246 (16%) neurons responded around the reward. We suggest that basolateral amygdala, by anticipating and then delineating the schedule and representing reward contingency, provide contextual information that is important for adjusting motivational level as a function of immediate behavior goals.",

         "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation.",

         "Over the past two decades, the role of apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs has become clear. Apoptosis may occur via a death receptor‐dependent (extrinsic) or independent (intrinsic or mitochondrial) pathway. Mitochondria play a central role in cell death in response to DNA damage, and mediate the interaction(s) of various cytoplasmic organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The mitochondrial pathway of cell death is mediated by Bcl‐2 family proteins, a group of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that regulate the passage of small molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis‐inducing factor, which activates caspase cascades, through the mitochondrial transition pore. In addition, apoptosis can induce autophagic cell death via crosstalk between the two pathways upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The current review focused on recent advances surrounding the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by anticancer agents and discussed potential molecular targets for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect(s) of anticancer agents.

         "Phytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in some cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many bacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phytochrome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features of a bonafide phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the chromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXα, which is produced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore was shown to be covalently attached via its A‐ring endo‐vinyl group to a cysteine residue outside the defined bilin lyase domain of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes. Site‐directed mutagenesis identified Cys12 and His247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility, respectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red‐light‐absorbing Pr form and immediately converted into a far‐red‐light‐absorbing Pfr‐enriched form. It shows the characteristic red/far‐red‐light‐induced photoreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that lacks the C15/16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to a 15Z/15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphorylation of PaBphP was demonstrated, confirming its role as a sensor kinase of a bacterial two‐component signaling system.",

         "Two subfamilies of the polar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) located on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis, along with unknown phospholipids, were recently shown to participate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages (Villeneuve, C., G. Etienne, V. Abadie, H. Montrozier, C. Bordier, F. Laval, M. Daffe, I. Maridonneau-Parini, and C. Astarie-Dequeker. 2003.

Biol. Chem. 278: 51291–51300). As demonstrated herein, a phospholipid mixture that derived from the methanol-insoluble fraction inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis. Inhibition was essentially attributable to phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), namely PIM2 and PIM6, because the purified phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were inactive. This was further confirmed using purified PIM2 and PIM6 from M. bovis BCG that decreased by half the internalization of M. smegmatis. Both compounds also inhibited the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium but had no effect on the internalization of zymosan used as a control particle of the phagocytic process. When coated on latex beads, PIM2 and polar GPL (GPL III) favored the particle entry through complement receptor 3. GPL III, but not PIM2, also directed particle entry through the mannose receptor. Therefore, surface-exposed mycobacterial PIM and polar GPL participate in the receptor-dependent internalization of mycobacteria in human macrophages.",

         "Insights from the developing world: thrifty genotypes and thrifty phenotypes",
         "Few researchers would dispute that the pandemic of obesity is caused by a profound mismatch between humanity's present environmental circumstances and those that have moulded evolutionary selection. This concept was first articulated when gestational diabetes was described as being the result of a ‘thrifty genotype rendered detrimental by progress’. More recently, this hypothesis has been extended to the concept of a ‘thrifty phenotype’ to describe the metabolic adaptations adopted as a survival strategy by a malnourished fetus; changes that may also be inappropriate to deal with a later life of affluence. Both the thrifty genotype and the thrifty phenotype hypotheses would predict that populations in some areas of the developing world would be at greater risk of obesity and its co-morbidities; a proposition to be explored in the present paper. To date thrifty genes remain little more than a nebulous concept propagated by the intuitive logic that man has been selected to survive episodic famine and seasonal hungry periods. Under such conditions those individuals who could lay down extra energy stores and use them most efficiently would have a survival advantage. The search for candidate thrifty genes needs to cover every aspect of human energy balance from food-seeking behaviour to the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The present paper will describe examples of attempts to find thrifty genes in three selected candidate areas: maternally-transmitted mitochondrial genes; the uncoupling proteins; apoE4, whose geographical distribution has been linked to a possible thrifty role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.",

         "BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process. First, a BXH-2–specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence–binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-γ in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.",

         "The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression (\"reverse immunology\"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in proteomics for the identification of tumor antigens. These advances are opening the door for targeted vaccine development, and for using immune response signatures as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",

         "BACKGROUND\nElevated concentrations of homocysteine in blood may be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations can be caused by decreased methylation of homocysteine to form methionine, as occurs in folate deficiency. A parallel pathway exists for methylation of homocysteine, in which choline, by way of betaine, is the methyl donor.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to determine whether choline deficiency results in a decreased capacity to methylate homocysteine.\n\n\nDESIGN\nC57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, or 35 mmol choline/kg diet for 3 wk. We then administered an oral methionine load to the animals and measured plasma homocysteine concentrations. Also, in a pilot study, we examined 8 men who were fed a diet providing 550 mg choline/d per 70 kg body weight for 10 d, followed by a diet providing almost no choline, until the subjects were clinically judged to be choline deficient or for <or=42 d. A methionine load was administered at the end of each dietary phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hours after the methionine load, choline-deficient mice had plasma homocysteine concentrations twice those of choline-fed mice. Four hours after the methionine load, clinically choline-depleted men had plasma homocysteine concentrations that were 35% greater than those in men not choline depleted.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that choline, like folate, plays an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine in humans and that response to a methionine load may be useful when assessing choline nutriture.",

The authors found no evidence for a special role of phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli; it seems that fear relevance in general is more important than is the evolutionary age. The pattern of results indicates that attention toward threatening stimuli is mainly affected by a late component that prolongs the disengagement of attention.",

         "We have created a stable transgenic rag2-EGFP-mMyc zebrafish line that develops GFP-labeled T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), allowing visualization of the onset and spread of this disease. Here, we show that leukemias from this transgenic line are highly penetrant and render animals moribund by 80.7 ± 17.6 days of life (±1 SD, range = 50-158 days). These T cell leukemias are clonally aneuploid, can be transplanted into irradiated recipient fish, and express the zebrafish orthologues of the human T-ALL oncogenes tal1/scl and lmo2, thus providing an animal model for the most prevalent molecular subgroup of human T-ALL. Because T-ALL develops very rapidly in rag2-EGFP-mMyc transgenic fish (in which “mMyc” represents mouse c-Myc), this line can only be maintained by in vitro fertilization. Thus, we have created a conditional transgene in which the EGFP-mMyc oncogene is preceded by a loxed dsRED2 gene and have generated stable rag2-loxP-dsRED2-loxP-EGFP-mMyc transgenic zebrafish lines, which have red fluorescent thymocytes and do not develop leukemia. Transgenic progeny from one of these lines can be induced to develop T-ALL by injecting Cre RNA into one-cell-stage embryos, demonstrating the utility of the Cre/lox system in the zebrafish and providing an essential step in preparing this model for chemical and genetic screens designed to identify modifiers of Myc-induced T-ALL.",

         "Neurexins constitute a large family of highly variable cell-surface molecules that may function in synaptic transmission and/or synapse formation. Each of the three known neurexin genes encodes two major neurexin variants, α- and β-neurexins, that are composed of distinct extracellular domains linked to identical intracellular sequences. Deletions of one, two, or all three α-neurexins in mice recently demonstrated their essential role at synapses. In multiple α-neurexin knock-outs, neurotransmitter release from excitatory and inhibitory synapses was severely reduced, primarily probably because voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels were impaired. It remained unclear, however, which neurexin variants actually influence exocytosis and Ca2+ channels, which domain of neurexins is required for this function, and which Ca2+-channel subtypes are regulated. Here, we show by electrophysiological recordings that transgenic neurexin 1α rescues the release and Ca2+-current phenotypes, whereas transgenic neurexin 1β has no effect, indicating the importance of the extracellular sequences for the function of neurexins. Because neurexin 1α rescued the knock-out phenotype independent of the α-neurexin gene deleted, these data are consistent with a redundant function among different α-neurexins. In both knock-out and transgenically rescued mice, α-neurexins selectively affected the component of neurotransmitter release that depended on activation of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, but left L-type Ca2+ channels unscathed. Our findings indicate that α-neurexins represent organizer molecules in neurotransmission that regulate N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, constituting an essential role at synapses that critically involves the extracellular domains of neurexins.",

         "Plants that hyperaccumulate Ni exhibit an exceptional degree of Ni tolerance and the ability to translocate Ni in large amounts from root to shoot. In hyperaccumulator plants in the genus Alyssum, free His is an important Ni binding ligand that increases in the xylem proportionately to root Ni uptake. To determine the molecular basis of the His response and its contribution to Ni tolerance, transcripts representing seven of the eight enzymes involved in His biosynthesis were investigated in the hyperaccumulator species Alyssum lesbiacum by RNA gel blot analysis. None of the transcripts changed in abundance in either root or shoot tissue when plants were exposed to Ni, but transcript levels were constitutively higher in A. lesbiacum than in the congeneric nonaccumulator A. montanum, especially for the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyltransferase (ATP-PRT). Comparison with the weak hyperaccumulator A. serpyllifolium revealed a close correlation between Ni tolerance, root His concentration, and ATP-PRT transcript abundance. Overexpression of an A. lesbiacum ATP-PRT cDNA in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana increased the pool of free His up to 15-fold in shoot tissue, without affecting the concentration of any other amino acid. His-overproducing lines also displayed elevated tolerance to Ni but did not exhibit increased Ni concentrations in either xylem sap or shoot tissue, suggesting that additional factors are necessary to recapitulate the complete hyperaccumulator phenotype. These results suggest that ATP-PRT expression plays a major role in regulating the pool of free His and contributes to the exceptional Ni tolerance of hyperaccumulator Alyssum species.",

         "SspA is required for acid resistance in stationary phase by downregulation of H‐NS in Escherichia coli",
         "The stringent starvation protein A (SspA) is a RNA polymerase‐associated protein and is required for transcriptional activation of bacteriophage P1 late promoters. However, the role of SspA in gene expression in Escherichia coli is essentially unknown. In this work, we show that SspA is essential for cell survival during acid‐induced stress. Apparently, SspA inhibits stationary‐phase accumulation of H‐NS, a global regulator which functions mostly as a repressor, thereby derepressing multiple stress defence systems including those for acid stress and nutrient starvation. Consequently, the gene expression pattern of the H‐NS regulon  is  altered  in  the  sspA mutant,  leading  to acid‐sensitive and hypermotile phenotypes. Thus, our study indicates that SspA is a global regulator, which acts upstream of H‐NS, and thereby plays an important role in the stress response of E. coli during stationary phase. In addition, our results indicate that the expression of the H‐NS regulon is sensitive to small changes in the cellular level of H‐NS, enabling the cell to response rapidly to environment cues. As SspA and H‐NS are highly conserved among Gram‐negative bacteria, of which many are pathogenic, the global role of SspA in the stress response and pathogenesis is discussed.",

         "The chromatoid body in spermatogenesis.",
         "All germ cells throughout the animal kingdom contain cytoplasmic cloud-like accumulations of material called nuage. Polar bodies in Drosophila oocytes are probably the best known forms of nuage. In spermatogenic cells, the nuage is called chromatoid body (CB). In early spermatids of the rat, it has a diameter of 1-1.5 microm and a finely filamentous lobular structure. Typically, it is associated with a multitude of vesicles. It is first clearly seen in mid- and late pachytene spermatocytes as an intermitochondrial dense material. During early spermiogenesis it is seen near the Golgi complex and frequently connected by material continuities through nuclear pore complexes with intranuclear particles. In living cells, the CB moves around the Golgi complex and has frequent contacts with it. The CB also moves perpendicularly to the nuclear envelope, and even through cytoplasmic bridges to the neighbour spermatids. One of the major components of the CB is a DEAD-box RNA helicase VASA that belongs to a class of proteins thought to act as RNA chaperones. It is a general marker of all germ cells and best characterized in Drosophila. The mouse VASA homologue was recently used as a marker of sperm formation from embryonic stem cells. It becomes generally accepted that the CB with its associated structures constitute a mechanism of post-transcriptional processing and storage of several mRNA species that are shared between neighbour cells and used for translation when the genome of the spermatids becomes inactive.",

         "The increasing photorealism for computer graphics has made computer graphics a convincing form of image forgery. Therefore, classifying photographic images and photorealistic computer graphics has become an important problem for image forgery detection. In this paper, we propose a new geometry-based image model, motivated by the physical image generation process, to tackle the above-mentioned problem. The proposed model reveals certain physical differences between the two image categories, such as the gamma correction in photographic images and the sharp structures in computer graphics. For the problem of image forgery detection, we propose two levels of image authenticity definition, i.e., imaging-process authenticity and scene authenticity, and analyze our technique against these definitions. Such definition is important for making the concept of image authenticity computable. Apart from offering physical insights, our technique with a classification accuracy of 83.5% outperforms those in the prior work, i.e., wavelet features at 80.3% and cartoon features at 71.0%. We also consider a recapturing attack scenario and propose a counter-attack measure. In addition, we constructed a publicly available benchmark dataset with images of diverse content and computer graphics of high photorealism.",

         "Gene expression after freshwater transfer in gills and opercular epithelia of killifish: insight into divergent mechanisms of ion transport",
         "SUMMARY We have explored the molecular basis for differences in physiological function between the gills and opercular epithelium of the euryhaline killifish Fundulus heteroclitus. These tissues are functionally similar in seawater, but in freshwater the gills actively absorb Na+ but not Cl–, whereas the opercular epithelium actively absorbs Cl– but not Na+. These differences in freshwater physiology are likely due to differences in absolute levels of gene expression (measured using real-time PCR), as several proteins important for Na+ transport, namely Na+,H+-exchanger 2 (NHE2), carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2), Na+,HCO3–cotransporter 1, and V-type H+-ATPase, were expressed at 3- to over 30-fold higher absolute levels in the gills. In gills, transfer from 10% seawater to freshwater increased the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase by twofold (from 12 h to 7 days), increased the expression of NHE2 (at 12 h) and CA2 (from 12 h to 7 days), and decreased the expression of NHE3 (from 12 h to 3 days). In opercular epithelium, NHE2 was not expressed; furthermore, Na+,K+-ATPase activity was unchanged after transfer to freshwater, CA2 mRNA levels decreased, and NHE3 levels increased. Consistent with their functional similarities in seawater, killifish gills and opercular epithelium expressed Na+,K+-ATPase α1a, Na+,K+,2Cl–cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl– channel and the signalling protein 14-3-3a at similar absolute levels. Furthermore, NKCC1 and CFTR were suppressed equally in each tissue after freshwater transfer, and 14-3-3a mRNA increased in both. These results provide insight into the mechanisms of ion transport by killifish gills and opercular epithelia, and demonstrate a potential molecular basis for the differences in physiological function between these two organs.",

         "Human organic anion transporter 2 (hOat2 [SLC22A7]) is highly expressed in the human liver. Although localization, gene expression, substrate specificity and transport mechanisms of other human Oat isoforms such as human Oat1 (hOat1), human Oat3 (hOat3) and human Oat4 (hOat4) have been elucidated, information concerning human Oat2 (hOat2) is less defined. The objective of this study was to provide further information on the transport mechanism and substrate specificity of hOat2. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the transport of organic compounds mediated by hOat2 was not affected by the replacement of extracellular sodium with lithium, choline and mannitol. The uptake of estrone sulfate (ES) in hOat2‐expressing oocytes was significantly trans‐stimulated by preloading the oocytes with fumarate and succinate, but not glutarate. Moreover, we observed that hOat2 mediates the transport of bumetanide, ES, glutarate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, allopurinol, prostaglandin E2, 5‐fluorouracil, paclitaxel and L‐ascorbic acid. These compounds are identified for the first time as hOat2 substrates. A wide range of structurally unrelated organic compounds inhibited the hOat2‐mediated uptake of tetracycline, except for sulfobromophthalein. All of these findings indicate that hOat2 is a sodium‐independent multi‐specific organic anion/dimethyldicarboxylate exchanger. Our present findings thus provide further insights into the role of hOat2 in hepatic drug transport.",

         "DNA damage activates the monoubiquitination of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein, FANCD2, resulting in the assembly of FANCD2 nuclear foci. In the current study, we characterize structural features of FANCD2 required for this intranuclear translocation. We have previously identified 2 normal mRNA splice variants of FANCD2, one containing exon 44 sequence at the 3' end (FANCD2-44) and one containing exon 43 sequence (FANCD2-43). The 2 predicted FANCD2 proteins differ in their carboxy terminal 24 amino acids. In stably transfected FANCD2(-/-) fibroblasts, FANCD2-44 and FANCD2-43 proteins were monoubiquitinated on K561. Only FANCD2-44 corrected the mitomycin C (MMC) sensitivity of the transfected cells. We find that monoubiquitinated FANCD2-44 was translocated from the soluble nuclear compartment into chromatin. A mutant form of FANCD2-44 (FANCD2-K561R) was not monoubiquitinated and failed to bind chromatin. A truncated FANCD2 protein (Exon44-T), lacking the carboxy terminal 24 amino acids encoded by exon 44 but retaining K561, and another mutant FANCD2 protein, with a single amino acid substitution at a conserved residue within the C-terminal 24 amino acids (D1428A), were monoubiquitinated. Both mutants were targeted to chromatin but failed to correct MMC sensitivity. Taken together, our results indicate that monoubiquitination of FANCD2 regulates chromatin binding and that D1428 within the carboxy terminal acidic sequence encoded by exon 44 is independently required for functional complementation of FA-D2 cells. We hypothesize that the carboxy terminus of FANCD2-44 plays a critical role in sensing or repairing DNA damage.",

         "Coltman and Slate (2003) recently performed a meta-analysis on studies that investigated the association between genetic variation at microsatellite loci and phenotypic trait variation. One factor not explicitly addressed in their meta-analysis is the actual estimation of genome-wide heterozygosity via molecular markers. Many authors still associate marker-estimated heterozygosity with genome-wide heterozygosity, despite allozyme-based evidence that such correlations are usually very weak or nonexistent. Here, we show that genome-wide heterozygosity is poorly estimated not only by allozymes but also by microsatellite loci and by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thus, associations between fitness (or other phenotypes) and heterozygosity should be established firmly on causative factors and not on simple correlations.",

It is also assumed that one or more example objects with similar materials and known geometry are imaged under the same illumination conditions. Unlike most previous work in shape reconstruction, this technique can handle objects with arbitrary and spatially-varying BRDFs. Furthermore, the approach works for arbitrary distant and unknown lighting environments. Finally, almost no calibration is needed, making the approach exceptionally simple to apply.",

         "Tip growth in neuronal cells, plant cells, and fungal hyphae is known to require tip-localized Rho GTPase, calcium, and filamentous actin (F-actin), but how they interact with each other is unclear. The pollen tube is an exciting model to study spatiotemporal regulation of tip growth and F-actin dynamics. An Arabidopsis thaliana Rho family GTPase, ROP1, controls pollen tube growth by regulating apical F-actin dynamics. This paper shows that ROP1 activates two counteracting pathways involving the direct targets of tip-localized ROP1: RIC3 and RIC4. RIC4 promotes F-actin assembly, whereas RIC3 activates Ca2+ signaling that leads to F-actin disassembly. Overproduction or depletion of either RIC4 or RIC3 causes tip growth defects that are rescued by overproduction or depletion of RIC3 or RIC4, respectively. Thus, ROP1 controls actin dynamics and tip growth through a check and balance between the two pathways. The dual and antagonistic roles of this GTPase may provide a unifying mechanism by which Rho modulates various processes dependent on actin dynamics in eukaryotic cells.",

         "Purpose: Cutaneous melanoma is a common, aggressive cancer with increasing incidence. The identification of melanoma-specific deregulated genes could provide molecular markers for lymph node staging assays and further insight into melanoma tumorigenesis. Experimental Design: Total RNA isolated from 45 primary melanoma, 18 benign skin nevi, and 7 normal skin tissue specimens were analyzed on an Affymetrix Hu133A microarray containing 22,000 probe sets. Results: Hierarchical clustering revealed a distinct separation of the melanoma samples from the benign and normal specimens. Novel genes associated with malignant melanoma were identified. Differential gene expression of two melanoma-specific genes, PLAB and L1CAM, were tested by a one-step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay on primary malignant melanoma, benign nevi, and normal skin samples, as well as on malignant melanoma lymph node metastasis and melanoma-free lymph nodes. The performance of the markers was compared with conventional melanoma markers such as tyrosinase, gp100, and MART1. Conclusion: Our study systematically identified novel melanoma-specific genes and showed the feasibility of using a combination of PLAB and L1CAM in a reverse transcription-PCR assay to differentiate clinically relevant samples containing benign or malignant melanocytes.",

         "Growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are highly up-regulated during development and following renal injury and are known to induce marked morphogenic actions in cultured tubular epithelial cells, including scattering, migration, single cell branching morphogenesis, and multicellular branching tubulogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that HGF stimulates epithelial cells to express neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal), a member of the lipocalin family of secreted proteins that has recently been shown to participate in mesenchymal-epithelial transformation via its ability to augment cellular iron uptake. At concentrations below those found to mediate iron transport, purified Ngal can induce a promigratory and probranching effect that is dependent on ERK activation. The suppression of Ngal expression using short hairpin RNA results in increased cyst formation by tubular cells. However, the simultaneous addition of Ngal and HGF leads to direct association of the two proteins, and results in a partial inhibition of HGF-mediated activation of c-Met and the downstream MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways. This inhibitory effect down-regulates HGF-stimulated single cell migration, and limits branching morphogenesis at both the single cell and multicellular level. These experiments demonstrate that the local expression of Ngal can play a regulatory role in epithelial morphogenesis by promoting the organization of cells into tubular structures while simultaneously negatively modulating the branching effects of HGF.",

         "Sulforaphane, a constituent of many edible cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, effectively suppresses proliferation of cancer cells in culture and in vivo by causing apoptosis induction, but the sequence of events leading to cell death is poorly defined. Here, we show that multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak play a critical role in apoptosis induction by sulforaphane. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (a) sulforaphane treatment caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the protein levels of both Bax and Bak and conformational change and mitochondrial translocation of Bax in SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from wild-type mice to trigger cytosolic release of apoptogenic molecules (cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and ultimately cell death; (b) MEFs derived from Bax or Bak knockout mice resisted cell death by sulforaphane, and (c) MEFs derived from Bax and Bak double knockout mice exhibited even greater protection against sulforaphane-induced cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis compared with wild-type or single knockout cells. Interestingly, sulforaphane treatment also caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the protein level of Apaf-1 in wild-type, Bax-/-, and Bak-/- MEFs but not in double knockout, suggesting that Bax and Bak might regulate sulforaphane-mediated induction of Apaf-1 protein. A marked decline in the protein level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis on treatment with sulforaphane was also observed. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that sulforaphane-induced apoptosis is amplified by a decrease in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis level, which functions to block cell death by inhibiting activities of caspases. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that Bax and Bak proteins play a critical role in initiation of cell death by sulforaphane.",

         "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. In virtually all SMA patients, a nearly identical copy gene is present, SMN2. SMN2 cannot fully compensate for the loss of SMN1 because the majority of transcripts derived from SMN2 lack a critical exon (exon 7), resulting in a dysfunctional SMN protein. Therefore, the critical distinction between a functional and a dysfunctional SMN protein is the inclusion or the exclusion of the exon 7 encoded peptide. To determine the role of the 16 amino acids encoded by SMN exon 7, a panel of synthetic mutations were transiently expressed in SMA patient fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Consistent with previous reports, the protein encoded by SMN exons 1-6 was primarily restricted to the nucleus. However, a variety of heterologous sequences fused to the C-terminus of SMN exons 1-6 allowed mutant SMN proteins to properly distribute to the cytoplasm and to the nuclear gems. These data demonstrate that the SMN exon 7 sequence is not specifically required, rather this region functions as a non-specific 'tail' that facilitates proper localization. Therefore, a possible means to restore additional activity to the SMNDelta7 protein could be to induce a longer C-terminus by suppressing recognition of the native stop codon. To address this possibility, aminoglycosides were examined for their ability to restore detectable levels of SMN protein in SMA patient fibroblasts. Aminoglycosides can suppress the accurate identification of translation termination codons in eukaryotic cells. Consistent with this, treatment of SMA patient fibroblasts with tobramycin and amikacin resulted in a quantitative increase in SMN-positive gems and an overall increase in detectable SMN protein. Taken together, this work describes the role of the critical exon 7 region and identifies a possible alternative approach for therapeutic intervention.",

         "Melanocytes, after cell division, separate and migrate along the basement membrane; they extend their dendrites and establish multiple contacts with keratinocytes. Once adhesion is established, keratinocytes control melanocyte growth and expression of cell surface receptors. Most melanomas arise within the epidermis (melanoma in situ) and then invade across the basement membrane. These melanoma cells escape from control by keratinocytes through five major mechanisms: (1) downregulation of receptors important for communication with keratinocytes such as E-cadherin, P-cadherin, and desmoglein, which is achieved through growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and endothelin-1 produced by fibroblasts or keratinocytes; (2) upregulation of receptors and signaling molecules important for melanoma cell-melanoma cell and melanoma cell-fibroblast interactions such as N-cadherin, Mel-CAM, and zonula occludens protein-1; (3) deregulation of morphogens such as Notch receptors and their ligands; (4) loss of anchorage to the basement membrane because of an altered expression of cell-matrix adhesion molecules; (5) increased elaboration of metal-loproteinases. Thus, investigating normal melanocyte homeostasis helps us to better define how melanoma cells escape the microenvironment created by epidermal keratinocytes and how they develop new cellular partners in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which support their growth and invasion.",

Microglia, the immunocompetent cells of the brain, contribute significantly to the tumor and are potential interaction partners of the glioma cells. We studied the impact of the presence of microglia on tumor cell invasion in cultured brain slices. To selectively deplete microglia, the slices were treated with clodronate-filled liposomes. When glioma cells were injected into slices devoid of endogenous microglia, the invasiveness of the tumors was significantly decreased as compared with controls. Inoculation of exogenous microglia together with glioma cells into cultured brain slices increased the infiltrative behavior of the tumor depending on the microglia/glioma cell ratio. Cell culture experiments revealed that soluble factors released from glioma cells strongly stimulate metalloprotease-2 activity in microglia. In the brain slices inoculated with glioma cells, increased activity of metalloprotease-2 was directly correlated with the abundance of microglia. Our data indicate that glioma cells stimulate microglial cells to increase breakdown of extracellular matrix and thereby promote tumor invasiveness.",

         "Cryptochromes (CRY) are blue light photoreceptors that mediate various light-induced responses in plants and animals. Arabidopsis CRY (CRY1 and CRY2) functions through negatively regulating constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) 1, a repressor of photomorphogenesis. Water evaporation and photosynthesis are regulated by the stomatal pores in plants, which are closed in darkness but open in response to blue light. There is evidence only for the phototropin blue light receptors (PHOT1 and PHOT2) in mediating blue light regulation of stomatal opening. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized role for Arabidopsis CRY and COP1 in the regulation of stomatal opening. Stomata of the cry1 cry2 double mutant showed reduced blue light response, whereas those of the CRY1-overexpressing plants showed hypersensitive response to blue light. In addition, stomata of the phot1 phot2 double mutant responded to blue light, but those of the cry1 cry2 phot1 phot2 quadruple mutant hardly responded. Strikingly, stomata of the cop1 mutant were constitutively open in darkness and stomata of the cry1 cry2 cop1 and phot1 phot2 cop1 triple mutants were open as wide as those of the cop1 single mutant under blue light. These results indicate that CRY functions additively with PHOT in mediating blue light-induced stomatal opening and that COP1 is a repressor of stomatal opening and likely acts downstream of CRY and PHOT signaling pathways.",

         "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-A165-induced Prostacyclin Synthesis Requires the Activation of VEGF Receptor-1 and -2 Heterodimer*",
         "We previously reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165 inflammatory effect is mediated by acute platelet-activating factor synthesis from endothelial cells upon the activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and its coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In addition, VEGF-A165 promotes the release of other endothelial mediators including nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI2). However, it is unknown whether VEGF-A165 is mediating PGI2 synthesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and/or VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation and whether the coreceptor NRP-1 potentiates VEGF-A165 activity. In this study, PGI2 synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was assessed by quantifying its stable metabolite (6-keto prostaglandin F1α, 6-keto PGF1α) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment of BAEC with VEGF analogs, VEGF-A165 (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 agonist) and VEGF-A121 (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonist) (up to 10–9 m), increased PGI2 synthesis by 70- and 40-fold within 15 min. Treatment with VEGFR-1 (placental growth factor and VEGF-B) or VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C) agonist did not increase PGI2 synthesis. The combination of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonists did not increase PGI2 release. Pretreatment with a VEGFR-2 inhibitor abrogated PGI2 release mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121, and pretreatment of BAEC with antisense oligomers targeting VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 mRNA reduced PGI2 synthesis mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121 up to 79%. In summary, our data demonstrate that the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 heterodimer (VEGFR-1/R-2) is essential for PGI2 synthesis mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121, which cannot be reproduced by the parallel activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 homodimers with corresponding agonists. In addition, the binding of VEGF-A165 to NRP-1 potentiates its capacity to promote PGI2 synthesis.",

         "CD46 Is a Cellular Receptor for All Species B Adenoviruses except Types 3 and 7",
         "ABSTRACT The 51 human adenovirus serotypes are divided into six species (A to F). Adenovirus serotypes from all species except species B utilize the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor for attachment to host cells in vitro. Species B adenoviruses primarily cause ocular and respiratory tract infections, but certain serotypes are also associated with renal disease. We have previously demonstrated that adenovirus type 11 (species B) uses CD46 (membrane cofactor protein) as a cellular receptor instead of the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (A. Segerman et al., J. Virol. 77:9183-9191, 2003). In the present study, we found that transfection with human CD46 cDNA rendered poorly permissive Chinese hamster ovary cells more permissive to infection by all species B adenovirus serotypes except adenovirus types 3 and 7. Moreover, rabbit antiserum against human CD46 blocked or efficiently inhibited all species B serotypes except adenovirus types 3 and 7 from infecting human A549 cells. We also sequenced the gene encoding the fiber protein of adenovirus type 50 (species B) and compared it with the corresponding amino acid sequences from selected serotypes, including all other serotypes of species B. From the results obtained, we conclude that CD46 is a major cellular receptor on A549 cells for all species B adenoviruses except types 3 and 7.",

         "Drosophila Wingless (Wg) is the founding member of the Wnt family of secreted proteins. During the wing development, Wg acts as a morphogen whose concentration gradient provides positional cues for wing patterning. The molecular mechanism(s) of Wg gradient formation is not fully understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the roles of glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein (Dlp), the Wg receptors Frizzled (Fz) and Fz2, and the Wg co-receptor Arrow (Arr) in Wg gradient formation in the wing disc. We demonstrate that both Dally and Dlp are essential and have different roles in Wg gradient formation. The specificities of Dally and Dlp in Wg gradient formation are at least partially achieved by their distinct expression patterns. To our surprise, although Fz2 was suggested to play an essential role in Wg gradient formation by ectopic expression studies, removal of Fz2 activity does not alter the extracellular Wg gradient. Interestingly, removal of both Fz and Fz2, or Arr causes enhanced extracellular Wg levels, which is mainly resulted from upregulated Dlp levels. We further show that Notum, a negative regulator of Wg signaling, downregulates Wg signaling mainly by modifying Dally. Last, we demonstrate that Wg movement is impeded by cells mutant for both dally and dlp. Together, these new findings suggest that the Wg morphogen gradient in the wing disc is mainly controlled by combined actions of Dally and Dlp. We propose that Wg establishes its concentration gradient by a restricted diffusion mechanism involving Dally and Dlp in the wing disc.",

         "Salicylic acid accumulation under O3 exposure is regulated by ethylene in tobacco plants.",
         "Ozone (O3), a major photochemical oxidant, induces leaf injury concomitant with salicylic acid (SA) synthesis. In pathogen-infected leaves, SA is synthesized via two pathways, involving phenylalanine or isochorismate. SA biosynthesis under O3 fumigation is not well understood. When we applied 14C-labeled benzoic acid (a precursor of SA in the pathway via phenylalanine) to O3-exposed tobacco leaves, it was effectively metabolized to SA. However, the activity and mRNA level of isochorismate synthase (ICS) were not increased. In contrast, ICS activity was increased in O3-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana L. These results suggest that SA is synthesized via benzoic acid from phenylalanine in O3-exposed tobacco leaves but via isochorismate in Arabidopsis. Ethylene is a plant hormone that promotes leaf damage in O3-exposed plants. During O3 exposure, transgenic plants with a phenotype of reduced O3-induced ethylene production accumulated less SA than did wild-type plants. O3 increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and the transcript levels of the chorismate mutase (CM) and PAL genes in wild-type tobacco, but their induction was suppressed in the transgenic plants. These results indicate that ethylene promotes SA accumulation by regulating the expression of the CM and PAL genes in O3-exposed tobacco.",

         "Purpose: Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, the growth regulatory mechanisms of which are unknown. We investigated the involvement of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals in synovial sarcoma and evaluated the therapeutic effect of inhibiting the FGF signal. Experimental Design: The expression of 22 FGF and 4 FGF receptor (FGFR) genes in 18 primary tumors and five cell lines of synovial sarcoma were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Effects of recombinant FGF2, FGF8, and FGF18 for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the growth of synovial sarcoma cell lines were analyzed. Growth inhibitory effects of FGFR inhibitors on synovial sarcoma cell lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results: Synovial sarcoma cell lines expressed multiple FGF genes especially those expressed in neural tissues, among which FGF8 showed growth stimulatory effects in all synovial sarcoma cell lines. FGF signals in synovial sarcoma induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38MAPK but not c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Disruption of the FGF signaling pathway in synovial sarcoma by specific inhibitors of FGFR caused cell cycle arrest leading to significant growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition by the FGFR inhibitor was associated with a down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 but not p38MAPK, and an ERK kinase inhibitor also showed growth inhibitory effects for synovial sarcoma, indicating that the growth stimulatory effect of FGF was transmitted through the ERK1/2. Conclusions: FGF signals have an important role in the growth of synovial sarcoma, and inhibitory molecules will be of potential use for molecular target therapy in synovial sarcoma.",

         "This study was designed to investigate the effects of the aqueous ethanol extract of Astragalus membranaceus BUNGE (Leguminosae) on rat thoracic aorta. Isometric tension was recorded in response to drugs in organ bath. In endothelium-intact aortic rings, A. membranaceus extract induced a significant dose-dependent relaxation of the rings precontracted by phenylephrine, which could be inhibited by preincubation with L-N(omega)-nitro-arginine methyl ester or methylthioninium chloride. In endothelium-denuded ones, the extract could dose-dependently relax the rings contracted by phenylephrine, not by KCl; and it could also attenuate contractile response to phenylephrine, not to caffeine or phorbol-12,13-diacetate in Ca(2+)-free medium; but it failed to affect the CaCl(2)-induced enhancement of contractile response to phenylephrine in Ca(2+)-free medium. These results indicate that nitric oxide signaling and Ca(2+)-handling pathway are involved in the A. membranaceus extract-induced vasodilatation.",

         "In this report, we use zebrafish as a model system to understand the importance of CD146 in vascular development. Endothelial‐specific expression of CD146 was verified by whole‐mount in situ hybridization. Suppression of CD146 protein expression by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) resulted in poorly developed intersomitic vessels (ISVs). In CD146 morphants, we observed a lack of blood flow through the ISV region, despite that fluorescence microangiography showed that the ISVs were present. This finding suggests that the lumens of the developing ISVs may be too narrow for proper circulation. Additionally, remodeling of the caudal vein plexus into functional vascular tubes appeared to be affected. Suppression of CD146 protein expression resulted in a circulation shunt that caused the circulation to by‐pass part of the caudal artery/vein system. The same vascular defects were recapitulated by using a second morpholino oligonucleotide. This morphant expressed a truncated CD146 protein with amino acids V32 to T57 at the N terminus deleted in an in‐frame manner. This region, therefore, is likely to contain elements critical for CD146 function. This study provides the first in vivo functional assessment of CD146 in embryonic development by showing that knockdown of CD146 protein expression severely hinders vascular development in zebrafish.

         "Cardiac troponin I is a phosphorylation target for endothelin-activated protein kinase C. Earlier work in cardiac myocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I provided evidence that protein kinase C-mediated cardiac troponin I phosphorylation accelerates relaxation. However, replacement with the slow skeletal isoform also alters the myofilament pH response and the Ca2+ transient, which could influence endothelin-mediated relaxation. Here, differences in the Ca2+ transient could not explain the divergent relaxation response to endothelin in myocytes expressing cardiac versus slow skeletal troponin I nor could activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Three separate clusters within cardiac troponin I are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and we set out to determine the contribution of the Thr144 and Ser23/Ser24 clusters to the endothelin-mediated contractile response. Myocyte replacement with a cardiac troponin I containing a Thr144 substituted with the Pro residue found in slow skeletal troponin I resulted in prolonged relaxation in response to acute endothelin compared with control myocytes. Ser23/Ser24 also is a target for protein kinase C phosphorylation of purified cardiac troponin I, and although this cluster was not acutely phosphorylated in intact myocytes, significant phosphorylation developed within 1 h after adding endothelin. Replacement of Ser23/Ser24 with Ala indicated that this cluster contributes significantly to relaxation during more prolonged endothelin stimulation. Overall, results with these mutants provide evidence that Thr144 plays an important role in the acute acceleration of relaxation, whereas Ser23/Ser24 contributes to relaxation during more prolonged activation of protein kinase C by endothelin.",

         "This paper documents a study, carried out in the academic year 2003-2004, on fifteen factors that may influence performance on a first year object-oriented programming module. The factors included prior academic experience, prior computer experience, self-perception of programming performance and comfort level on the module and specific cognitive skills. The study found that a student's perception of their understanding of the module had the strongest correlation with programming performance, r=0.76, p‹0.01. In addition, Leaving Certificate (LC) mathematics and science scores were shown to have a strong correlation with performance. A regression module, based upon a student's perception of their understanding of the module, gender, LC mathematics score and comfort level was able to account for 79% of the variance in programming performance results.",

         "Objective—The high and low responder phenomenon describes individual differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) activity. We characterized patterns of intracellular accumulation, externalization, and shedding of TF in response to LPS in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). Methods and Results—After 2 hours of LPS stimulation of whole blood, flow cytometry analyses revealed a larger population of TF-positive monocytes in HRs (32.0±3.5%) versus LRs (11.2±1.2%; P≤0.05), along with a stronger mean fluorescence intensity of TF signal in HRs (7.1±0.5 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with LRs (5.4±0.4 AU; P≤0.05). The LPS-treated blood of the HR group contained 2-fold more TF-positive microparticles than LRs. In-cell Western assay demonstrated higher intracellular accumulation of TF in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from LRs because LPS induced a 3.7-fold increase of total TF levels in LRs versus a 1.5-fold increase in HRs. In contrast, in response to LPS stimulation, MNCs from HRs exhibited a 4-fold induction of surface TF, whereas MNCs from LRs only had a minor increase in surface TF levels. Conclusions—The higher availability of surface TF antigen on MNCs from HRs and TF-containing microparticles might make these individuals more susceptible to hypercoagulation.",

         "Cbl proteins have been implicated in ligand-induced TCR/CD3 down-modulation, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed the effect of mutation of a cbl-binding site on ZAP-70 (ZAP-Y292F) on dynamics, internalization, and degradation of the TCR/CD3 complex in response to distinct stimuli. Naive CD8 T cells expressing the P14 transgenic TCR from ZAP-Y292F mice were selectively affected in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to antigenic stimulation, whereas neither anti-CD3 Ab-, and PMA-induced TCR down-modulation, nor constitutive receptor endocytosis/cycling were impaired. We further established that the defect in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to Ag was paralleled by an impaired TCR/CD3 internalization and CD3ζ degradation. Analysis of T/APC conjugates revealed that delayed redistribution of TCR at the T/APC contact zone was paralleled by a delay in TCR internalization in the synaptic zone in ZAP-Y292F compared with ZAP-wild-type T cells. Cbl recruitment to the synapse was also retarded in ZAP-Y292F T cells, although F-actin and LFA-1 redistribution was similar for both cell types. This study identifies a step involving ZAP-70/cbl interaction that is critical for rapid internalization of the TCR/CD3 complex at the CD8 T cell/APC synapse.",

         "In this work we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn the CPU time-slice utilization behavior of known programs in a Linux system. Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The \"Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis\" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C'4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution. We find our result interesting in the context that generally operating systems presently never make use of a program's previous execution history in their scheduling behavior.",

Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a new member of the NLRR family, NLRR4, and its potential role in long-lasting memory. We generated NLRR4-deficient (NLRR4−/−) mice and found that they showed impaired memory retention. In hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, NLRR4−/− mice were able to learn and maintain the memories for one day but unable to retain the memories for four days after learning. In contrast, in a hippocampus-independent task, NLRR4−/− mice were able to retain the memory normally for at least seven days. These results suggest that NLRR4 plays a key role in hippocampus-dependent long-lasting memory.",

         "We present an encoding framework which exploits semantics for video content delivery. The video content is organized based on the idea of main content message. In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.",

         "ABSTRACT Of the nasopharyngeal cultures recovered from 942 day care center (DCC) attendees in Lisbon, Portugal, 591 (62%) yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae during a surveillance performed in February and March of 1999. Forty percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. In particular, 2% were penicillin resistant and 20% had intermediate penicillin resistance. Multidrug resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracycline was the most frequent antibiotype (17% of all isolates). Serotyping and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were performed for 202 out of 237 drug-resistant pneumococci (DRPn). The most frequent serotypes were 6B (26%), 14 (22%), 19F (16%), 23F (10%), and nontypeable (12%). The majority (67%) of the DRPn strains were representatives of nine international clones included in the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network; eight of them had been detected in previous studies. Fourteen novel clones were identified, corresponding to 26% of the DRPn strains. The remaining 7% of the strains were local clones detected in our previous studies. Comparison with studies conducted since 1996 in Portuguese DCCs identified several trends: (i) the rate of DRPn frequency has fluctuated between 40 and 50%; (ii) the serotypes most frequently recovered have remained the same; (iii) nontypeable strains appear to be increasing in frequency; and (iv) a clone of serotype 33F emerged in 1999. Together, our observations highlight that the nasopharynxes of children in DCCs are a melting pot of successful DRPn clones that are important to study and monitor if we aim to gain a better understanding on the epidemiology of this pathogen.",

         "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

         "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of mortality accounting for approximately 10% of all deaths from malignancy in the western world. Polymorphism in the glutathione S-transferase GSTT1 gene has been associated with CRC risk in some but not all studies. In this study, we examined associations between GSTT1 genotypes and CRC risk, and prognosis in 361 cases and 881 unrelated controls. GSTT1 null was associated with a small but significant increase in risk (P = 0.0006, odds ratio (OR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-2.24). GSTT1 null was also associated with a significantly younger age at diagnosis (mean 65.2 years) compared with GSTT1 A (mean 67.6 years, P = 0.031). There were no significant associations between GSTT1 genotypes and clinical factors (e.g. Dukes stage, differentiation and tumour node metastasis classification) in the total case group. However, following stratification by age (<70 versus > or =70 years at diagnosis), in the patients diagnosed <70 years of age, GSTT1 null was more common in Dukes grade A/B tumours (P = 0.046), stage T1/T2 tumours (P = 0.053) and those with a pushing margin (P = 0.066). We also identified associations between GSTT1 null and increased prevalence of host lymphocyte response, particularly in the younger patients (P = 0.036). Furthermore, GSTT1 null was associated with improved survival in younger patients (P = 0.017, hazards ratio (HR) = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.31-0.89) but poorer survival in older patients (P = 0.017, HR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.12-3.20). We proposed a model based on the dual functionality of GSTT1 to explain these contrasting results. We suggest that the null genotype is associated with improved immune response in younger patients, but poorer detoxification in older patients. These findings may also provide an explanation for the contrasting finding of other studies on the role of this gene in CRC.",

         "In eukaryotic cellular proteins, protein N‐myristoylation has been recognized as a protein modification that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic proteins. In this study, to search for a eukaryotic N‐myristoylated transmembrane protein, the susceptibility of the N‐terminus of several G‐protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) to protein N‐myristoylation was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling. It was found that the N‐terminal 10 residues of B96Bom, a Bombyx mori GPCR, efficiently directed the protein N‐myristoylation. Analysis of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) fusion protein with the N‐terminal 90 residues of B96Bom at its N‐terminus revealed that (a) transmembrane domain 1 of B96Bom functioned as a type I signal anchor sequence, (b) the N‐myristoylated N‐terminal domain (58 residues) was translocated across the membrane, and (c) two N‐glycosylation motifs located in this domain were efficiently N‐glycosylated. In addition, when Ala4 in the N‐myristoylation motif of B96Bom90‐TNF, Met‐Gly‐Gln‐Ala‐Ala‐Thr(1–6), was replaced with Asn to generate a new N‐glycosylation motif, Asn‐Ala‐Thr(4–6), efficient N‐glycosylation was observed on this newly introduced N‐glycosylation site in the expressed protein. These results indicate that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of B96Bom is translocated across the membrane and exposed to the extracellular surface. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a eukaryotic transmembrane protein can be N‐myristoylated and that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of the protein can be translocated across the membrane.",

         "Tissue remodelling is dependent on the integration of signals that control turnover of ECM (extracellular matrix). Breakdown and endocytosis of collagen, a major component of the ECM, is central to this process. Whereas controlled secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes (such as matrix metalloproteinases) has long been known to mediate ECM breakdown, it is becoming clear that uPARAP/Endo180 (where uPARAP stands for urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein) serves as a receptor that mediates endocytosis of collagen by several types of cells. In the liver, the stellate cells play a major role in turnover of ECM including collagens. These cells synthesize various collagens and also produce matrix metalloproteinases. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of rat hepatic stellate cells to endocytose and degrade 125I-labelled heat-denatured collagen I. It was found that the collagen is efficiently taken up and degraded by these cells. Degradation was inhibited by inhibitors of lysosomal proteases (leupeptin and E-64d) and the vacuolar proton pump (concanamycin A), indicating that it takes place in lysosomes. Furthermore, endocytosed FITC-labelled collagen was shown to reach late endocytic compartments in which it colocalized with LysoTracker (a marker of late endocytic compartments). Competition experiments showed that uPA and unlabelled collagen are capable of inhibiting binding and uptake of [125I]collagen in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Western-blot analysis of cell lysate (using a polyclonal rabbit human-Endo180 antiserum) revealed a single band at 180 kDa. In addition, the antiserum was capable of reducing [125I]collagen binding to the cell surface. Finally, using two primers designed from the human uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA sequence, the expression of uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR. These results together suggest that uPARAP/Endo180 mediates endocytosis of collagen in rat liver stellate cells.",

         "Abstract Laboratory natural selection and artificial selection are vital tools for addressing specific questions about evolutionary patterns of variation. Laboratory natural selection can illuminate whether a putative selective agent is capable of generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits and the extent to which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss theoretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken beyond model organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation.",

         "The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events. We recorded neurons from the basolateral complex of two monkeys while they performed visually cued schedules of sequential color discrimination trials, with both valid and random cues. When the cues were valid, the visual cue, which was present throughout each trial, indicated how many trials remained to be successfully completed before a reward. Seventy-six percent of recorded neurons showed response selectivity, with the selectivity depending on some aspects of the current schedule. After a reward, when the monkeys knew that the upcoming cue would be valid, 88 of 246 (36%) neurons responded between schedules, seemingly anticipating the receiving information about the upcoming schedule length. When the cue appeared, 102 of 246 (41%) neurons became selective, at this point encoding information about whether the current trial was the only trial required or how many more trials are needed to obtain a reward. These cue-related responses had a median latency of 120 ms (just between the latencies in inferior temporal visual area TE and perirhinal cortex). When the monkey was releasing a touch bar to complete the trial correctly, 71 of 246 (29%) neurons responded, with responses in the rewarded trials being similar no matter which schedule was ending, thus being sensitive to the reward contingency. Finally, 39 of 246 (16%) neurons responded around the reward. We suggest that basolateral amygdala, by anticipating and then delineating the schedule and representing reward contingency, provide contextual information that is important for adjusting motivational level as a function of immediate behavior goals.",

         "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation.",

         "Over the past two decades, the role of apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs has become clear. Apoptosis may occur via a death receptor‐dependent (extrinsic) or independent (intrinsic or mitochondrial) pathway. Mitochondria play a central role in cell death in response to DNA damage, and mediate the interaction(s) of various cytoplasmic organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The mitochondrial pathway of cell death is mediated by Bcl‐2 family proteins, a group of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that regulate the passage of small molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis‐inducing factor, which activates caspase cascades, through the mitochondrial transition pore. In addition, apoptosis can induce autophagic cell death via crosstalk between the two pathways upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The current review focused on recent advances surrounding the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by anticancer agents and discussed potential molecular targets for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect(s) of anticancer agents.

         "Phytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in some cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many bacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phytochrome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features of a bonafide phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the chromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXα, which is produced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore was shown to be covalently attached via its A‐ring endo‐vinyl group to a cysteine residue outside the defined bilin lyase domain of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes. Site‐directed mutagenesis identified Cys12 and His247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility, respectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red‐light‐absorbing Pr form and immediately converted into a far‐red‐light‐absorbing Pfr‐enriched form. It shows the characteristic red/far‐red‐light‐induced photoreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that lacks the C15/16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to a 15Z/15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphorylation of PaBphP was demonstrated, confirming its role as a sensor kinase of a bacterial two‐component signaling system.",

         "Two subfamilies of the polar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) located on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis, along with unknown phospholipids, were recently shown to participate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages (Villeneuve, C., G. Etienne, V. Abadie, H. Montrozier, C. Bordier, F. Laval, M. Daffe, I. Maridonneau-Parini, and C. Astarie-Dequeker. 2003.

Biol. Chem. 278: 51291–51300). As demonstrated herein, a phospholipid mixture that derived from the methanol-insoluble fraction inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis. Inhibition was essentially attributable to phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), namely PIM2 and PIM6, because the purified phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were inactive. This was further confirmed using purified PIM2 and PIM6 from M. bovis BCG that decreased by half the internalization of M. smegmatis. Both compounds also inhibited the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium but had no effect on the internalization of zymosan used as a control particle of the phagocytic process. When coated on latex beads, PIM2 and polar GPL (GPL III) favored the particle entry through complement receptor 3. GPL III, but not PIM2, also directed particle entry through the mannose receptor. Therefore, surface-exposed mycobacterial PIM and polar GPL participate in the receptor-dependent internalization of mycobacteria in human macrophages.",

         "Few researchers would dispute that the pandemic of obesity is caused by a profound mismatch between humanity's present environmental circumstances and those that have moulded evolutionary selection. This concept was first articulated when gestational diabetes was described as being the result of a ‘thrifty genotype rendered detrimental by progress’. More recently, this hypothesis has been extended to the concept of a ‘thrifty phenotype’ to describe the metabolic adaptations adopted as a survival strategy by a malnourished fetus; changes that may also be inappropriate to deal with a later life of affluence. Both the thrifty genotype and the thrifty phenotype hypotheses would predict that populations in some areas of the developing world would be at greater risk of obesity and its co-morbidities; a proposition to be explored in the present paper. To date thrifty genes remain little more than a nebulous concept propagated by the intuitive logic that man has been selected to survive episodic famine and seasonal hungry periods. Under such conditions those individuals who could lay down extra energy stores and use them most efficiently would have a survival advantage. The search for candidate thrifty genes needs to cover every aspect of human energy balance from food-seeking behaviour to the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The present paper will describe examples of attempts to find thrifty genes in three selected candidate areas: maternally-transmitted mitochondrial genes; the uncoupling proteins; apoE4, whose geographical distribution has been linked to a possible thrifty role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.",

         "Real-time prediction of video source traffic is an important step in many network management tasks such as dynamic bandwidth allocation and end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control strategies. In this paper, an adaptive prediction model for MPEG-coded traffic is developed. A novel technology is used, first developed in the signal processing community, called sparse basis selection. It is based on selecting a small subset of inputs (basis) from among a large dictionary of possible inputs. A new sparse basis selection algorithm is developed that is based on efficiently updating the input selection adaptively. When a new measurement is received, the proposed algorithm updates the selected inputs in a recursive manner. Thus, adaptability is not only in the weight adjustment, but also in the dynamic update of the inputs. The algorithm is applied to the problem of single-step-ahead prediction of MPEG-coded video source traffic, and the developed method achieves improved results, as compared to the published results in the literature. The present analysis indicates that the adaptive feature of the developed algorithm seems to add significant overall value.",

         "BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process. First, a BXH-2–specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence–binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-γ in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.",

         "The functions of 17beta-estradiol (E2) are mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta. ERs display similar DNA- and ligand-binding properties in vitro. However, ERbeta shows lower transcriptional activity than ERalpha from the estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent signaling. We predicted that distinct amino termini contribute to differences in transcription efficacies of ERs by affecting in situ ER-ERE interactions. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and a novel in situ ERE competition assay, which is based on the ability of ER to compete for ERE binding with a designer activator that constitutively induces transcription from an ERE-driven reporter construct. Interference of activator-mediated transcription by unliganded or liganded ERs was taken as an indication of ER-ERE interaction. Results revealed that ERs interacted with ERE similarly in the absence of E2. However, E2 enhanced the ERE binding of ERalpha but not that of ERbeta. The removal of the amino terminus increased the ERbeta-ERE interaction independent of E2. The ERbeta amino terminus also prevented E2-mediated enhancement of the chimeric ERalpha-ERE interaction. Thus, the amino terminus of ERbeta impairs the binding of ERbeta to ERE. The abrogation of ligand-dependent activation function 2 of the amino-terminally truncated ERbeta resulted in the manifestation of E2 effect on ERbeta-ERE interaction. This implies that E2-mediated enhancement of ERbeta-ERE interaction is masked by the activation function 2, whereas the intact amino terminus is a dominant region that decreases the binding of ERbeta to ERE. Thus, ERbeta-ERE interaction is independent of E2 and is impaired by its amino terminus. These findings provide an additional explanation for differences between ERalpha and ERbeta functions that could differentially affect the physiology and pathophysiology of E2 signaling.",

         "We present a mobile acoustic beacon based sensor node localization method. Our technique is passive in that the sensor nodes themselves do not need to generate an acoustic signal for ranging. This saves cost, power and provides stealthy operation. Furthermore, the beacon can generate much more acoustic energy than a severely resource constrained sensor node, thereby significantly increasing the range. The acoustic ranging method uses a linear frequency modulated signal that can be accurately detected by matched filtering. This provides longer range and higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The localization algorithm was especially designed to work in such acoustically reverberant environment, as urban terrain. The algorithm presented handles non-Gaussian ranging errors caused by echoes. Node locations are computed centrally by solving a global non-linear optimization problem in an iterative and incremental fashion",

         "Researchers in the area of information security have mainly been concerned with tools, techniques and policies that firms can use to protect themselves against security breaches. However, information security is as much about security software as it is about secure software. Software is not secure when it has defects or flaws which can be exploited by hackers to cause attacks such as unauthorized intrusion or denial of service attacks. Any public announcement makes about a software defect is termed as 'vulnerability disclosure'. Although research in software economics have studied firms' incentive to improve overall quality, there have been no studies to show that software vendors have an incentive to invest in building more secure software. In this paper, we use the event study methodology to examine software vendors' incentives to build more secure software. We collect data from leading national newspapers and industry sources like CERT by searching for reports on published software vulnerabilities. We show that vulnerability disclosures lead to a negative and significant change in market value for a software vendor. On average, a vendor loses around 0.6% value in stock price when a vulnerability is reported. This is equivalent to a loss in market capitalization values of $0.86 billion per vulnerability announcement. To provide further insight, we use the information content of the disclosure announcement to classify vulnerabilities into various types. We find that the change in stock price is more negative if the vendor fails to provide a patch at the time of disclosure. Moreover, vulnerabilities which cause a confidentiality related breach cause a greater decline in the market value for a vendor than the vulnerabilities which cause non-confidentiality related breaches. Also, more severe flaws have a significantly greater impact than flaws with low or moderate severity. Finally, we find that the markets do not punish a software vendor more severely if a third party discovers a flaw in its product than if the vendor itself discovers the flaw. Our analysis provides many interesting implications for software vendors as well as policy makers.",

         "ABSTRACT Reliable and sensitive quantification of Phytophthora capsici in pepper plants is of crucial importance in managing the multiple syndromes caused by this pathogen. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the determination of P. capsici in pepper tissues. DNA levels of a highly virulent and a less virulent isolate were measured in different pepper genotypes with varying degrees of resistance. Using SYBR Green and specific primers for P. capsici, the minimal amount of pathogen DNA quantified was 10 pg. Pathogen DNA was recorded as early as 8 h postinoculation. Thereafter, the increase was rapid in susceptible cultivars and slower in resistant ones. The amount of pathogen DNA quantified in each pepper genotype correlated with susceptibility to Phytophthora root rot. Likewise, there was a relationship between the virulence of the pathogen and the degree of colonization. Differences also were found in oomycete amount among pepper tissues, with maximal pathogen biomass occurring in stems. The real-time PCR technique developed in this study was sensitive and robust enough to assess both pathogen development and resistance to Phytophthora root rot in different pepper genotypes.",

         "ABSTRACT Growth, patterning, and apoptosis are mutually interactive during development. For example, cells that select an abnormal fate in a developing field are frequently removed by apoptosis. An important issue in this process that needs to be resolved is the mechanism used by cells to discern their correct fate from an abnormal fate. In order to examine this issue, we developed an animal model that expresses the dioxin receptor homolog Spineless (Ss) ectopically in the Drosophila wing. The presence of mosaic clones ectopically expressing ss results in a local transformation of organ identity, homeosis, from wing into a leg or antenna. The cells with misspecified fates subsequently activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase to undergo apoptosis in an autonomous or nonautonomous manner depending on their position within the wing, suggesting that a cell-cell interaction is, at least in some cases, involved in the detection of misspecified cells. Similar position dependence is commonly observed when various homeotic genes controlling the body segments are ectopically expressed. The autonomous and nonautonomous apoptosis caused by ss is regulated by a novel leucine-rich repeat family transmembrane protein, Fish-lips (Fili) that interacts with surrounding normal cells. These data support a mechanism in which the lack of some membrane proteins helps to recognize the presence of different cell types and direct these cells to an apoptotic fate in order to exclude them from the normal developing field.",

         "The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression (\"reverse immunology\"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in proteomics for the identification of tumor antigens. These advances are opening the door for targeted vaccine development, and for using immune response signatures as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",

         "Molecular Mechanisms of Cation Transport by the Renal Na+-K+-Cl- Cotransporter",
         "Two variants of the renal Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2), called NKCC2A and NKCC2F, display marked differences in Na+, Rb+, and Cl- affinities, yet are identical to one another except for a 23-residue membrane-associated domain that is derived from alternatively spliced exons. The proximal portion of these exons is predicted to encode the second transmembrane domain (tm2) in the form of an α-helix, and the distal portion, part of the following connecting segment (cs1a). In recent studies, we have taken advantage of the A–F differences in kinetic behavior to determine which regions in tm2-cs1a are involved in ion transport. Functional characterizations of chimeras in which tm2 or cs1a were interchanged between the variants showed that both regions are important in specifying ion affinities, but did not allow delineating the contribution of individual residues. Here, we have extended these structure-function analyses by studying additional mutants in which variant residues between A and F were interchanged individually in the tm2-cs1a region (amino acid number 216, 220, 223, 229, or 233 in NKCC2). None of the substitutions were found to affect Km (C1-), suggesting that the affinity difference for anion transport is conveyed by a combination of variant residues in this domain. However, 2 substitutions in the tm2 of F were found to affect cation constants specifically; interestingly, one of these mutations (residue 216) only affected Km (Rb+) while the other (residue 220) only affected Km (Na+). We have thus identified two novel residues in NKCC2 that play a key role in cation transport. Because such residues should be adjacent to one another on the vertical axis of the tm2 α-helix, our results imply, furthermore, that the ion transport sites in NKCC2 could be physically linked.",

         "Choline deficiency in mice and humans is associated with increased plasma homocysteine concentration after a methionine load.",
         "BACKGROUND\nElevated concentrations of homocysteine in blood may be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations can be caused by decreased methylation of homocysteine to form methionine, as occurs in folate deficiency. A parallel pathway exists for methylation of homocysteine, in which choline, by way of betaine, is the methyl donor.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to determine whether choline deficiency results in a decreased capacity to methylate homocysteine.\n\n\nDESIGN\nC57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, or 35 mmol choline/kg diet for 3 wk. We then administered an oral methionine load to the animals and measured plasma homocysteine concentrations. Also, in a pilot study, we examined 8 men who were fed a diet providing 550 mg choline/d per 70 kg body weight for 10 d, followed by a diet providing almost no choline, until the subjects were clinically judged to be choline deficient or for <or=42 d. A methionine load was administered at the end of each dietary phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hours after the methionine load, choline-deficient mice had plasma homocysteine concentrations twice those of choline-fed mice. Four hours after the methionine load, clinically choline-depleted men had plasma homocysteine concentrations that were 35% greater than those in men not choline depleted.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that choline, like folate, plays an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine in humans and that response to a methionine load may be useful when assessing choline nutriture.",

         "Di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) is a common plasticizer and solvent that disrupts androgen-dependent male reproductive development in rats. In utero exposure to 500 mg/kg/day DBP on gestation days (GD) 12 to 21 decreases androgen biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in decreased fetal testicular testosterone levels. One consequence of prenatal DBP exposure is malformed epididymides in adult rats. Reduced fetal testosterone levels may be responsible for the malformation, since testosterone is required for Wolffian duct stabilization and their development into epididymides. Currently, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms of Wolffian duct differentiation. The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression associated with altered morphology of the proximal Wolffian duct following in utero exposure to DBP. Pregnant Crl:CD(R) (SD) rats were gavaged with corn oil vehicle or 500 mg/kg/day DBP from GD 12 to GD 19 or 21. There were only small morphological differences between control and DBP-exposed Wolffian ducts on GD 19. On GD 21, 89% of male fetuses in the DBP dose group showed marked underdevelopment of Wolffian ducts, characterized by decreased coiling. RNA was isolated from Wolffian ducts on GD 19 and 21. Together with empirical information, cDNA microarrays were used to help identify candidate genes that could be associated with the morphological changes observed on GD 21. These candidate genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Changes in mRNA expression were observed in genes within the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, the extracellular matrix, and in other developmentally conserved signaling pathways. On GD 19, immunolocalization of IGF-1 receptor protein demonstrated an increase in cytoplasmic expression in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells. There was also a variable decrease in androgen receptor protein in ductal epithelial cells on GD 19. This study provides insight into the effects of antiandrogens on the molecular mechanisms involved in Wolffian duct development. The altered morphology and changes in gene expression following DBP exposure are suggestive of altered paracrine interactions between ductal epithelial cells and the surrounding mesenchyme during Wolffian duct differentiation due to lowered testosterone production.",

         "Angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (a/LCI) is used to obtain quantitative, depth-resolved nuclear morphology measurements. We compare the average diameter and texture of cell nuclei in rat esophagus epithelial tissue to grading criteria established in a previous a/LCI study to prospectively grade neoplastic progression. We exploit the depth resolution of a/LCI to exclusively examine the basal layer of the epithelium, approximately 50 to 100 microm beneath the tissue surface, without the need for exogenous contrast agents, tissue sectioning, or fixation. The results of two studies are presented that compare the performance of two a/LCI modalities. Overall, the combined studies show 91% sensitivity and 97% specificity for detecting dysplasia, using histopathology as the standard. In addition, the studies enable the effects of dietary chemopreventive agents, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and curcumin, to be assessed by observing modulation in the incidence of neoplastic change. We demonstrate that a/LCI is highly effective for monitoring neoplastic change and can be applied to assessing the efficacy of chemopreventive agents in the rat esophagus.",

         "It has been argued that phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli elicit preattentive capture of attention. To distinguish between fear relevance and time of appearance in evolutionary history, the authors compare phylogenetic and ontogenetic fear-relevant and fear-irrelevant stimuli in a visual search task. The authors found no evidence for a special role of phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli; it seems that fear relevance in general is more important than is the evolutionary age. The pattern of results indicates that attention toward threatening stimuli is mainly affected by a late component that prolongs the disengagement of attention.",

In this study, we carried out histopathological analysis to elucidate the pathological features of the dermatitis in Ht-rats. We then tried to detect Staphylococcus species recovered from the skin lesions of Ht-rats. We also measured the serum levels of total IgE, IL-4 and IFN-gamma in these rats. The histopathological data indicated that inflammatory cells had infiltrated the skin lesions. Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from the skin lesions, and the serum levels of total IgE and IL-4 were elevated in Ht-rats with dermatitis.

         "Rat Strain Effects of AT1 Receptor Activation on D1 Dopamine Receptors in Immortalized Renal Proximal Tubule Cells",
         "The dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems regulate blood pressure, in part, by affecting sodium transport in renal proximal tubules (RPTs). We have reported that activation of a D1-like receptor decreases AT1 receptor expression in the mouse kidney and in immortalized RPT cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The current studies were designed to test the hypothesis that activation of the AT1 receptor can also regulate the D1 receptor in RPT cells, and this regulation is aberrant in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Long-term (24 hours) stimulation of RPT cells with angiotensin II, via AT1 receptors increased total cellular D1 receptor protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in WKY but not in SHR cells. Short-term stimulation (15 minutes) with angiotensin II did not affect total cellular D1 receptor protein in either rat strain. However, in the short-term experiments, angiotensin II decreased cell surface membrane D1 receptor protein in WKY but not in SHR cells. D1 and AT1 receptors colocalized (confocal microscopy) and their coimmunoprecipitation was greater in WKY than in SHRs. However, AT1/D1 receptor coimmunoprecipitation was decreased by angiotensin II (10−8M/24 hours) to a similar extent in WKY (−22±8%) and SHRs (−22±12%). In summary, these studies show that AT1 and D1 receptors interact differently in RPT cells from WKY and SHRs. It is possible that an angiotensin II-mediated increase in D1 receptors and dissociation of AT1 from D1 receptors serve to counter regulate the long-term action of angiotensin II in WKY rats; different effects are seen in SHRs.",

This report describes a metastatic GIST that stained strongly for cytokeratins, CD117, and CD34 in a patient who was previously diagnosed with gastric epithelioid angiosarcoma. A review of both tumours showed the same histological and immunohistochemical profiles, and c-kit molecular analysis revealed an insertional mutation at codon 558 of exon 11 in both tumours. Thus, pathologists should be aware that GISTs can occasionally express cytokeratins, and that c-kit mutational investigations may have a key diagnostic role and may prevent diagnostic mistakes that could have important clinical implications.",

         "The present study was undertaken to clarify the relationship between the p34cdc2 kinase activity of in vitro-aged or enucleated rat oocytes and the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) of microinjected cumulus cell nuclei. Wistar rat oocytes were placed in vitro up to 120 min after the animal was killed. The p34cdc2 kinase activity of the oocytes decreased in a time-dependent manner. The incidence of PCC was higher when nuclear injection into intact oocytes was completed in 15-45 min rather than 46-120 min. When rat oocytes were enucleated for subsequent nuclear injection, the p34cdc2 kinase activity transiently increased soon after enucleation but drastically decreased after 30 min. Removal of the cytoplasm instead of the meta-phase-plate did not affect the p34cdc2 kinase activity even after 60 min. PCC occurred in intact and cytoplasm-removed oocytes but not in enucleated oocytes. In contrast, oocytes from BDF1 mice exhibited a p34cdc2 kinase level twice that of rat oocytes and supported PCC despite enucleation. The p34cdc2 kinase level of intact rat oocytes was reduced to the equivalent level of aged (120 min) or enucleated (+60 min) oocytes by a 45 min treatment with roscovitine, an inhibitor of p34cdc2 kinase. None of the roscovitine-treated oocytes supported PCC while half of the control oocytes did. When rat oocytes were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, delayed inactivation of the p34cdc2 kinase was observed in the MG132-treated oocytes. A significantly higher proportion of the MG132-treated oocytes supported PCC when compared with the control oocytes. Moreover, a higher proportion of MG132-treated and enucleated oocytes carried two pseudo-pronuclei after cumulus cell injection and developed to the two-cell stage when compared with the enucleated oocytes at the telophase-II stage. These results suggest that the decreased level of p34cdc2 kinase activity in aged or enucleated rat oocytes is responsible for their inability to support PCC of microinjected donor cell nuclei and that inhibition of p34cdc2 kinase inactivation by chemicals such as MG132 is in part effective for rat oocytes to promote PCC and further development.",

         "OBJECTIVES\nTo compare the agreement between microbroth dilution and agar dilution for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Campylobacter jejuni.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUtilizing commercially prepared antimicrobial panels, microbroth dilution was compared with agar dilution for determining antimicrobial susceptibility in C. jejuni isolates. To assess the performance of both techniques for ampicillin, 190 C. jejuni isolates from dairy cattle were utilized. A group of 172 C. jejuni isolates from dairy sources were used to compare the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur results indicate that microbroth dilution and agar dilution agree within +/-1 log2 dilution for 86.7% of the isolates tested. Ciprofloxacin had the highest level of agreement for isolates tested by both techniques, resulting in a kappa of 0.886 and 97.1% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution. The least agreement was observed in determining the susceptibility of isolates to ampicillin and erythromycin (82.1 and 79.7% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution). However, kappa statistics were considered to have good agreement for these antimicrobials. There were no significant differences in the summary statistics for any of the five antimicrobials evaluated for the isolates analysed by the percentage of resistant isolates, MIC50, MIC75 or MIC90 beyond +/-1 log2 dilution. There was no association in the classification of resistance by the testing methods employed. We also demonstrated that the quality control strain of C. jejuni ATCC 33650 performed in a consistent manner for both agar dilution and microbroth dilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMicrobroth dilution may be an acceptable alternative to agar dilution for determining susceptibility of C. jejuni in research or surveillance where flow of samples, labour efficiency and cost may restrict the use of agar dilution.",

         "Explicit computational formulas for the coefficients of the periodic normal forms for all codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles in generic autonomous ODEs are derived. They include second-order coefficients for the fold (limit point) bifurcation, as well as third-order coefficients for the flip (period-doubling) and Neimark--Sacker (torus) bifurcations. The formulas are independent of the dimension of the phase space and involve solutions of certain boundary-value problems on the interval [0,T], where T is the period of the critical cycle, as well as multilinear functions from the Taylor expansion of the right-hand sides near the cycle. The formulas allow us to distinguish between sub- and supercritical bifurcations, in agreement with earlier asymptotic expansions of the bifurcating solutions. Our formulation makes it possible to use robust numerical boundary-value algorithms based on orthogonal collocation, rather than shooting techniques, which greatly expands its applicability. The actual implementation is described in detail. We include three numerical examples, in which codim 2 singularities are detected along branches of codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles as zeros of the periodic normal form coefficients.",
