         "Purpose: Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, the growth regulatory mechanisms of which are unknown. We investigated the involvement of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals in synovial sarcoma and evaluated the therapeutic effect of inhibiting the FGF signal. Experimental Design: The expression of 22 FGF and 4 FGF receptor (FGFR) genes in 18 primary tumors and five cell lines of synovial sarcoma were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Effects of recombinant FGF2, FGF8, and FGF18 for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the growth of synovial sarcoma cell lines were analyzed. Growth inhibitory effects of FGFR inhibitors on synovial sarcoma cell lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results: Synovial sarcoma cell lines expressed multiple FGF genes especially those expressed in neural tissues, among which FGF8 showed growth stimulatory effects in all synovial sarcoma cell lines. FGF signals in synovial sarcoma induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38MAPK but not c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Disruption of the FGF signaling pathway in synovial sarcoma by specific inhibitors of FGFR caused cell cycle arrest leading to significant growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition by the FGFR inhibitor was associated with a down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 but not p38MAPK, and an ERK kinase inhibitor also showed growth inhibitory effects for synovial sarcoma, indicating that the growth stimulatory effect of FGF was transmitted through the ERK1/2. Conclusions: FGF signals have an important role in the growth of synovial sarcoma, and inhibitory molecules will be of potential use for molecular target therapy in synovial sarcoma.",

         "This study was designed to investigate the effects of the aqueous ethanol extract of Astragalus membranaceus BUNGE (Leguminosae) on rat thoracic aorta. Isometric tension was recorded in response to drugs in organ bath. In endothelium-intact aortic rings, A. membranaceus extract induced a significant dose-dependent relaxation of the rings precontracted by phenylephrine, which could be inhibited by preincubation with L-N(omega)-nitro-arginine methyl ester or methylthioninium chloride. In endothelium-denuded ones, the extract could dose-dependently relax the rings contracted by phenylephrine, not by KCl; and it could also attenuate contractile response to phenylephrine, not to caffeine or phorbol-12,13-diacetate in Ca(2+)-free medium; but it failed to affect the CaCl(2)-induced enhancement of contractile response to phenylephrine in Ca(2+)-free medium. These results indicate that nitric oxide signaling and Ca(2+)-handling pathway are involved in the A. membranaceus extract-induced vasodilatation.",

         "Critical roles of CD146 in zebrafish vascular development",
         "In this report, we use zebrafish as a model system to understand the importance of CD146 in vascular development. Endothelial‐specific expression of CD146 was verified by whole‐mount in situ hybridization. Suppression of CD146 protein expression by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) resulted in poorly developed intersomitic vessels (ISVs). In CD146 morphants, we observed a lack of blood flow through the ISV region, despite that fluorescence microangiography showed that the ISVs were present. This finding suggests that the lumens of the developing ISVs may be too narrow for proper circulation. Additionally, remodeling of the caudal vein plexus into functional vascular tubes appeared to be affected. Suppression of CD146 protein expression resulted in a circulation shunt that caused the circulation to by‐pass part of the caudal artery/vein system. The same vascular defects were recapitulated by using a second morpholino oligonucleotide. This morphant expressed a truncated CD146 protein with amino acids V32 to T57 at the N terminus deleted in an in‐frame manner. This region, therefore, is likely to contain elements critical for CD146 function. This study provides the first in vivo functional assessment of CD146 in embryonic development by showing that knockdown of CD146 protein expression severely hinders vascular development in zebrafish.

         "Differential Contribution of Troponin I Phosphorylation Sites to the Endothelin-modulated Contractile Response*",
         "Cardiac troponin I is a phosphorylation target for endothelin-activated protein kinase C. Earlier work in cardiac myocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I provided evidence that protein kinase C-mediated cardiac troponin I phosphorylation accelerates relaxation. However, replacement with the slow skeletal isoform also alters the myofilament pH response and the Ca2+ transient, which could influence endothelin-mediated relaxation. Here, differences in the Ca2+ transient could not explain the divergent relaxation response to endothelin in myocytes expressing cardiac versus slow skeletal troponin I nor could activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Three separate clusters within cardiac troponin I are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and we set out to determine the contribution of the Thr144 and Ser23/Ser24 clusters to the endothelin-mediated contractile response. Myocyte replacement with a cardiac troponin I containing a Thr144 substituted with the Pro residue found in slow skeletal troponin I resulted in prolonged relaxation in response to acute endothelin compared with control myocytes. Ser23/Ser24 also is a target for protein kinase C phosphorylation of purified cardiac troponin I, and although this cluster was not acutely phosphorylated in intact myocytes, significant phosphorylation developed within 1 h after adding endothelin. Replacement of Ser23/Ser24 with Ala indicated that this cluster contributes significantly to relaxation during more prolonged endothelin stimulation. Overall, results with these mutants provide evidence that Thr144 plays an important role in the acute acceleration of relaxation, whereas Ser23/Ser24 contributes to relaxation during more prolonged activation of protein kinase C by endothelin.",

The study found that a student's perception of their understanding of the module had the strongest correlation with programming performance, r=0.76, p‹0.01. In addition, Leaving Certificate (LC) mathematics and science scores were shown to have a strong correlation with performance.

         "Objective—The high and low responder phenomenon describes individual differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) activity. We characterized patterns of intracellular accumulation, externalization, and shedding of TF in response to LPS in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). Methods and Results—After 2 hours of LPS stimulation of whole blood, flow cytometry analyses revealed a larger population of TF-positive monocytes in HRs (32.0±3.5%) versus LRs (11.2±1.2%; P≤0.05), along with a stronger mean fluorescence intensity of TF signal in HRs (7.1±0.5 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with LRs (5.4±0.4 AU; P≤0.05). The LPS-treated blood of the HR group contained 2-fold more TF-positive microparticles than LRs. In-cell Western assay demonstrated higher intracellular accumulation of TF in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from LRs because LPS induced a 3.7-fold increase of total TF levels in LRs versus a 1.5-fold increase in HRs. In contrast, in response to LPS stimulation, MNCs from HRs exhibited a 4-fold induction of surface TF, whereas MNCs from LRs only had a minor increase in surface TF levels. Conclusions—The higher availability of surface TF antigen on MNCs from HRs and TF-containing microparticles might make these individuals more susceptible to hypercoagulation.",

         "Cbl proteins have been implicated in ligand-induced TCR/CD3 down-modulation, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed the effect of mutation of a cbl-binding site on ZAP-70 (ZAP-Y292F) on dynamics, internalization, and degradation of the TCR/CD3 complex in response to distinct stimuli. Naive CD8 T cells expressing the P14 transgenic TCR from ZAP-Y292F mice were selectively affected in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to antigenic stimulation, whereas neither anti-CD3 Ab-, and PMA-induced TCR down-modulation, nor constitutive receptor endocytosis/cycling were impaired. We further established that the defect in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to Ag was paralleled by an impaired TCR/CD3 internalization and CD3ζ degradation. Analysis of T/APC conjugates revealed that delayed redistribution of TCR at the T/APC contact zone was paralleled by a delay in TCR internalization in the synaptic zone in ZAP-Y292F compared with ZAP-wild-type T cells. Cbl recruitment to the synapse was also retarded in ZAP-Y292F T cells, although F-actin and LFA-1 redistribution was similar for both cell types. This study identifies a step involving ZAP-70/cbl interaction that is critical for rapid internalization of the TCR/CD3 complex at the CD8 T cell/APC synapse.",

         "In this work we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn the CPU time-slice utilization behavior of known programs in a Linux system. Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The \"Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis\" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C'4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution. We find our result interesting in the context that generally operating systems presently never make use of a program's previous execution history in their scheduling behavior.",

Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a new member of the NLRR family, NLRR4, and its potential role in long-lasting memory. We generated NLRR4-deficient (NLRR4−/−) mice and found that they showed impaired memory retention. In hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, NLRR4−/− mice were able to learn and maintain the memories for one day but unable to retain the memories for four days after learning. In contrast, in a hippocampus-independent task, NLRR4−/− mice were able to retain the memory normally for at least seven days. These results suggest that NLRR4 plays a key role in hippocampus-dependent long-lasting memory.",

In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.",

         "ABSTRACT Of the nasopharyngeal cultures recovered from 942 day care center (DCC) attendees in Lisbon, Portugal, 591 (62%) yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae during a surveillance performed in February and March of 1999. Forty percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. In particular, 2% were penicillin resistant and 20% had intermediate penicillin resistance. Multidrug resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracycline was the most frequent antibiotype (17% of all isolates). Serotyping and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were performed for 202 out of 237 drug-resistant pneumococci (DRPn). The most frequent serotypes were 6B (26%), 14 (22%), 19F (16%), 23F (10%), and nontypeable (12%). The majority (67%) of the DRPn strains were representatives of nine international clones included in the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network; eight of them had been detected in previous studies. Fourteen novel clones were identified, corresponding to 26% of the DRPn strains. The remaining 7% of the strains were local clones detected in our previous studies. Comparison with studies conducted since 1996 in Portuguese DCCs identified several trends: (i) the rate of DRPn frequency has fluctuated between 40 and 50%; (ii) the serotypes most frequently recovered have remained the same; (iii) nontypeable strains appear to be increasing in frequency; and (iv) a clone of serotype 33F emerged in 1999. Together, our observations highlight that the nasopharynxes of children in DCCs are a melting pot of successful DRPn clones that are important to study and monitor if we aim to gain a better understanding on the epidemiology of this pathogen.",

         "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

         "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of mortality accounting for approximately 10% of all deaths from malignancy in the western world. Polymorphism in the glutathione S-transferase GSTT1 gene has been associated with CRC risk in some but not all studies. In this study, we examined associations between GSTT1 genotypes and CRC risk, and prognosis in 361 cases and 881 unrelated controls. GSTT1 null was associated with a small but significant increase in risk (P = 0.0006, odds ratio (OR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-2.24). GSTT1 null was also associated with a significantly younger age at diagnosis (mean 65.2 years) compared with GSTT1 A (mean 67.6 years, P = 0.031). There were no significant associations between GSTT1 genotypes and clinical factors (e.g. Dukes stage, differentiation and tumour node metastasis classification) in the total case group. However, following stratification by age (<70 versus > or =70 years at diagnosis), in the patients diagnosed <70 years of age, GSTT1 null was more common in Dukes grade A/B tumours (P = 0.046), stage T1/T2 tumours (P = 0.053) and those with a pushing margin (P = 0.066). We also identified associations between GSTT1 null and increased prevalence of host lymphocyte response, particularly in the younger patients (P = 0.036). Furthermore, GSTT1 null was associated with improved survival in younger patients (P = 0.017, hazards ratio (HR) = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.31-0.89) but poorer survival in older patients (P = 0.017, HR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.12-3.20). We proposed a model based on the dual functionality of GSTT1 to explain these contrasting results. We suggest that the null genotype is associated with improved immune response in younger patients, but poorer detoxification in older patients. These findings may also provide an explanation for the contrasting finding of other studies on the role of this gene in CRC.",

         "In eukaryotic cellular proteins, protein N‐myristoylation has been recognized as a protein modification that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic proteins. In this study, to search for a eukaryotic N‐myristoylated transmembrane protein, the susceptibility of the N‐terminus of several G‐protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) to protein N‐myristoylation was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling. It was found that the N‐terminal 10 residues of B96Bom, a Bombyx mori GPCR, efficiently directed the protein N‐myristoylation. Analysis of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) fusion protein with the N‐terminal 90 residues of B96Bom at its N‐terminus revealed that (a) transmembrane domain 1 of B96Bom functioned as a type I signal anchor sequence, (b) the N‐myristoylated N‐terminal domain (58 residues) was translocated across the membrane, and (c) two N‐glycosylation motifs located in this domain were efficiently N‐glycosylated. In addition, when Ala4 in the N‐myristoylation motif of B96Bom90‐TNF, Met‐Gly‐Gln‐Ala‐Ala‐Thr(1–6), was replaced with Asn to generate a new N‐glycosylation motif, Asn‐Ala‐Thr(4–6), efficient N‐glycosylation was observed on this newly introduced N‐glycosylation site in the expressed protein. These results indicate that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of B96Bom is translocated across the membrane and exposed to the extracellular surface. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a eukaryotic transmembrane protein can be N‐myristoylated and that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of the protein can be translocated across the membrane.",

         "Tissue remodelling is dependent on the integration of signals that control turnover of ECM (extracellular matrix). Breakdown and endocytosis of collagen, a major component of the ECM, is central to this process. Whereas controlled secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes (such as matrix metalloproteinases) has long been known to mediate ECM breakdown, it is becoming clear that uPARAP/Endo180 (where uPARAP stands for urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein) serves as a receptor that mediates endocytosis of collagen by several types of cells. In the liver, the stellate cells play a major role in turnover of ECM including collagens. These cells synthesize various collagens and also produce matrix metalloproteinases. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of rat hepatic stellate cells to endocytose and degrade 125I-labelled heat-denatured collagen I. It was found that the collagen is efficiently taken up and degraded by these cells. Degradation was inhibited by inhibitors of lysosomal proteases (leupeptin and E-64d) and the vacuolar proton pump (concanamycin A), indicating that it takes place in lysosomes. Furthermore, endocytosed FITC-labelled collagen was shown to reach late endocytic compartments in which it colocalized with LysoTracker (a marker of late endocytic compartments). Competition experiments showed that uPA and unlabelled collagen are capable of inhibiting binding and uptake of [125I]collagen in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Western-blot analysis of cell lysate (using a polyclonal rabbit human-Endo180 antiserum) revealed a single band at 180 kDa. In addition, the antiserum was capable of reducing [125I]collagen binding to the cell surface. Finally, using two primers designed from the human uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA sequence, the expression of uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR. These results together suggest that uPARAP/Endo180 mediates endocytosis of collagen in rat liver stellate cells.",

         "Abstract Laboratory natural selection and artificial selection are vital tools for addressing specific questions about evolutionary patterns of variation. Laboratory natural selection can illuminate whether a putative selective agent is capable of generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits and the extent to which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss theoretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken beyond model organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation.",

         "The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events. We recorded neurons from the basolateral complex of two monkeys while they performed visually cued schedules of sequential color discrimination trials, with both valid and random cues. When the cues were valid, the visual cue, which was present throughout each trial, indicated how many trials remained to be successfully completed before a reward. Seventy-six percent of recorded neurons showed response selectivity, with the selectivity depending on some aspects of the current schedule. After a reward, when the monkeys knew that the upcoming cue would be valid, 88 of 246 (36%) neurons responded between schedules, seemingly anticipating the receiving information about the upcoming schedule length. When the cue appeared, 102 of 246 (41%) neurons became selective, at this point encoding information about whether the current trial was the only trial required or how many more trials are needed to obtain a reward. These cue-related responses had a median latency of 120 ms (just between the latencies in inferior temporal visual area TE and perirhinal cortex). When the monkey was releasing a touch bar to complete the trial correctly, 71 of 246 (29%) neurons responded, with responses in the rewarded trials being similar no matter which schedule was ending, thus being sensitive to the reward contingency. Finally, 39 of 246 (16%) neurons responded around the reward. We suggest that basolateral amygdala, by anticipating and then delineating the schedule and representing reward contingency, provide contextual information that is important for adjusting motivational level as a function of immediate behavior goals.",

         "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation.",

         "Over the past two decades, the role of apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs has become clear. Apoptosis may occur via a death receptor‐dependent (extrinsic) or independent (intrinsic or mitochondrial) pathway. Mitochondria play a central role in cell death in response to DNA damage, and mediate the interaction(s) of various cytoplasmic organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The mitochondrial pathway of cell death is mediated by Bcl‐2 family proteins, a group of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that regulate the passage of small molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis‐inducing factor, which activates caspase cascades, through the mitochondrial transition pore. In addition, apoptosis can induce autophagic cell death via crosstalk between the two pathways upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The current review focused on recent advances surrounding the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by anticancer agents and discussed potential molecular targets for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect(s) of anticancer agents.

         "Phytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in some cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many bacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phytochrome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features of a bonafide phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the chromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXα, which is produced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore was shown to be covalently attached via its A‐ring endo‐vinyl group to a cysteine residue outside the defined bilin lyase domain of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes. Site‐directed mutagenesis identified Cys12 and His247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility, respectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red‐light‐absorbing Pr form and immediately converted into a far‐red‐light‐absorbing Pfr‐enriched form. It shows the characteristic red/far‐red‐light‐induced photoreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that lacks the C15/16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to a 15Z/15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphorylation of PaBphP was demonstrated, confirming its role as a sensor kinase of a bacterial two‐component signaling system.",

         "Two subfamilies of the polar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) located on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis, along with unknown phospholipids, were recently shown to participate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages (Villeneuve, C., G. Etienne, V. Abadie, H. Montrozier, C. Bordier, F. Laval, M. Daffe, I. Maridonneau-Parini, and C. Astarie-Dequeker. 2003.

Biol. Chem. 278: 51291–51300). As demonstrated herein, a phospholipid mixture that derived from the methanol-insoluble fraction inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis. Inhibition was essentially attributable to phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), namely PIM2 and PIM6, because the purified phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were inactive. This was further confirmed using purified PIM2 and PIM6 from M. bovis BCG that decreased by half the internalization of M. smegmatis. Both compounds also inhibited the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium but had no effect on the internalization of zymosan used as a control particle of the phagocytic process. When coated on latex beads, PIM2 and polar GPL (GPL III) favored the particle entry through complement receptor 3. GPL III, but not PIM2, also directed particle entry through the mannose receptor. Therefore, surface-exposed mycobacterial PIM and polar GPL participate in the receptor-dependent internalization of mycobacteria in human macrophages.",

         "Insights from the developing world: thrifty genotypes and thrifty phenotypes",
         "Few researchers would dispute that the pandemic of obesity is caused by a profound mismatch between humanity's present environmental circumstances and those that have moulded evolutionary selection. This concept was first articulated when gestational diabetes was described as being the result of a ‘thrifty genotype rendered detrimental by progress’. More recently, this hypothesis has been extended to the concept of a ‘thrifty phenotype’ to describe the metabolic adaptations adopted as a survival strategy by a malnourished fetus; changes that may also be inappropriate to deal with a later life of affluence. Both the thrifty genotype and the thrifty phenotype hypotheses would predict that populations in some areas of the developing world would be at greater risk of obesity and its co-morbidities; a proposition to be explored in the present paper. To date thrifty genes remain little more than a nebulous concept propagated by the intuitive logic that man has been selected to survive episodic famine and seasonal hungry periods. Under such conditions those individuals who could lay down extra energy stores and use them most efficiently would have a survival advantage. The search for candidate thrifty genes needs to cover every aspect of human energy balance from food-seeking behaviour to the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The present paper will describe examples of attempts to find thrifty genes in three selected candidate areas: maternally-transmitted mitochondrial genes; the uncoupling proteins; apoE4, whose geographical distribution has been linked to a possible thrifty role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.",

         "Real-time prediction of video source traffic is an important step in many network management tasks such as dynamic bandwidth allocation and end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control strategies. In this paper, an adaptive prediction model for MPEG-coded traffic is developed. A novel technology is used, first developed in the signal processing community, called sparse basis selection. It is based on selecting a small subset of inputs (basis) from among a large dictionary of possible inputs. A new sparse basis selection algorithm is developed that is based on efficiently updating the input selection adaptively. When a new measurement is received, the proposed algorithm updates the selected inputs in a recursive manner. Thus, adaptability is not only in the weight adjustment, but also in the dynamic update of the inputs. The algorithm is applied to the problem of single-step-ahead prediction of MPEG-coded video source traffic, and the developed method achieves improved results, as compared to the published results in the literature. The present analysis indicates that the adaptive feature of the developed algorithm seems to add significant overall value.",

         "BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process. First, a BXH-2–specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence–binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-γ in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.",

         "The functions of 17beta-estradiol (E2) are mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta. ERs display similar DNA- and ligand-binding properties in vitro. However, ERbeta shows lower transcriptional activity than ERalpha from the estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent signaling. We predicted that distinct amino termini contribute to differences in transcription efficacies of ERs by affecting in situ ER-ERE interactions. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and a novel in situ ERE competition assay, which is based on the ability of ER to compete for ERE binding with a designer activator that constitutively induces transcription from an ERE-driven reporter construct. Interference of activator-mediated transcription by unliganded or liganded ERs was taken as an indication of ER-ERE interaction. Results revealed that ERs interacted with ERE similarly in the absence of E2. However, E2 enhanced the ERE binding of ERalpha but not that of ERbeta. The removal of the amino terminus increased the ERbeta-ERE interaction independent of E2. The ERbeta amino terminus also prevented E2-mediated enhancement of the chimeric ERalpha-ERE interaction. Thus, the amino terminus of ERbeta impairs the binding of ERbeta to ERE. The abrogation of ligand-dependent activation function 2 of the amino-terminally truncated ERbeta resulted in the manifestation of E2 effect on ERbeta-ERE interaction. This implies that E2-mediated enhancement of ERbeta-ERE interaction is masked by the activation function 2, whereas the intact amino terminus is a dominant region that decreases the binding of ERbeta to ERE. Thus, ERbeta-ERE interaction is independent of E2 and is impaired by its amino terminus. These findings provide an additional explanation for differences between ERalpha and ERbeta functions that could differentially affect the physiology and pathophysiology of E2 signaling.",

Our technique is passive in that the sensor nodes themselves do not need to generate an acoustic signal for ranging. This saves cost, power and provides stealthy operation. Furthermore, the beacon can generate much more acoustic energy than a severely resource constrained sensor node, thereby significantly increasing the range. The acoustic ranging method uses a linear frequency modulated signal that can be accurately detected by matched filtering. This provides longer range and higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The localization algorithm was especially designed to work in such acoustically reverberant environment, as urban terrain. The algorithm presented handles non-Gaussian ranging errors caused by echoes. Node locations are computed centrally by solving a global non-linear optimization problem in an iterative and incremental fashion",

         "Impact of Software Vulnerability Announcements on the Market Value of Software Vendors - an Empirical Investigation",
         "Researchers in the area of information security have mainly been concerned with tools, techniques and policies that firms can use to protect themselves against security breaches. However, information security is as much about security software as it is about secure software. Software is not secure when it has defects or flaws which can be exploited by hackers to cause attacks such as unauthorized intrusion or denial of service attacks. Any public announcement makes about a software defect is termed as 'vulnerability disclosure'. Although research in software economics have studied firms' incentive to improve overall quality, there have been no studies to show that software vendors have an incentive to invest in building more secure software. In this paper, we use the event study methodology to examine software vendors' incentives to build more secure software. We collect data from leading national newspapers and industry sources like CERT by searching for reports on published software vulnerabilities. We show that vulnerability disclosures lead to a negative and significant change in market value for a software vendor. On average, a vendor loses around 0.6% value in stock price when a vulnerability is reported. This is equivalent to a loss in market capitalization values of $0.86 billion per vulnerability announcement. To provide further insight, we use the information content of the disclosure announcement to classify vulnerabilities into various types. We find that the change in stock price is more negative if the vendor fails to provide a patch at the time of disclosure. Moreover, vulnerabilities which cause a confidentiality related breach cause a greater decline in the market value for a vendor than the vulnerabilities which cause non-confidentiality related breaches. Also, more severe flaws have a significantly greater impact than flaws with low or moderate severity. Finally, we find that the markets do not punish a software vendor more severely if a third party discovers a flaw in its product than if the vendor itself discovers the flaw. Our analysis provides many interesting implications for software vendors as well as policy makers.",

         "ABSTRACT Reliable and sensitive quantification of Phytophthora capsici in pepper plants is of crucial importance in managing the multiple syndromes caused by this pathogen. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the determination of P. capsici in pepper tissues. DNA levels of a highly virulent and a less virulent isolate were measured in different pepper genotypes with varying degrees of resistance. Using SYBR Green and specific primers for P. capsici, the minimal amount of pathogen DNA quantified was 10 pg. Pathogen DNA was recorded as early as 8 h postinoculation. Thereafter, the increase was rapid in susceptible cultivars and slower in resistant ones. The amount of pathogen DNA quantified in each pepper genotype correlated with susceptibility to Phytophthora root rot. Likewise, there was a relationship between the virulence of the pathogen and the degree of colonization. Differences also were found in oomycete amount among pepper tissues, with maximal pathogen biomass occurring in stems. The real-time PCR technique developed in this study was sensitive and robust enough to assess both pathogen development and resistance to Phytophthora root rot in different pepper genotypes.",

         "ABSTRACT Growth, patterning, and apoptosis are mutually interactive during development. For example, cells that select an abnormal fate in a developing field are frequently removed by apoptosis. An important issue in this process that needs to be resolved is the mechanism used by cells to discern their correct fate from an abnormal fate. In order to examine this issue, we developed an animal model that expresses the dioxin receptor homolog Spineless (Ss) ectopically in the Drosophila wing. The presence of mosaic clones ectopically expressing ss results in a local transformation of organ identity, homeosis, from wing into a leg or antenna. The cells with misspecified fates subsequently activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase to undergo apoptosis in an autonomous or nonautonomous manner depending on their position within the wing, suggesting that a cell-cell interaction is, at least in some cases, involved in the detection of misspecified cells. Similar position dependence is commonly observed when various homeotic genes controlling the body segments are ectopically expressed. The autonomous and nonautonomous apoptosis caused by ss is regulated by a novel leucine-rich repeat family transmembrane protein, Fish-lips (Fili) that interacts with surrounding normal cells. These data support a mechanism in which the lack of some membrane proteins helps to recognize the presence of different cell types and direct these cells to an apoptotic fate in order to exclude them from the normal developing field.",

         "The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression (\"reverse immunology\"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in proteomics for the identification of tumor antigens. These advances are opening the door for targeted vaccine development, and for using immune response signatures as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",

         "Molecular Mechanisms of Cation Transport by the Renal Na+-K+-Cl- Cotransporter",
         "Two variants of the renal Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2), called NKCC2A and NKCC2F, display marked differences in Na+, Rb+, and Cl- affinities, yet are identical to one another except for a 23-residue membrane-associated domain that is derived from alternatively spliced exons. The proximal portion of these exons is predicted to encode the second transmembrane domain (tm2) in the form of an α-helix, and the distal portion, part of the following connecting segment (cs1a). In recent studies, we have taken advantage of the A–F differences in kinetic behavior to determine which regions in tm2-cs1a are involved in ion transport. Functional characterizations of chimeras in which tm2 or cs1a were interchanged between the variants showed that both regions are important in specifying ion affinities, but did not allow delineating the contribution of individual residues. Here, we have extended these structure-function analyses by studying additional mutants in which variant residues between A and F were interchanged individually in the tm2-cs1a region (amino acid number 216, 220, 223, 229, or 233 in NKCC2). None of the substitutions were found to affect Km (C1-), suggesting that the affinity difference for anion transport is conveyed by a combination of variant residues in this domain. However, 2 substitutions in the tm2 of F were found to affect cation constants specifically; interestingly, one of these mutations (residue 216) only affected Km (Rb+) while the other (residue 220) only affected Km (Na+). We have thus identified two novel residues in NKCC2 that play a key role in cation transport. Because such residues should be adjacent to one another on the vertical axis of the tm2 α-helix, our results imply, furthermore, that the ion transport sites in NKCC2 could be physically linked.",

         "BACKGROUND\nElevated concentrations of homocysteine in blood may be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations can be caused by decreased methylation of homocysteine to form methionine, as occurs in folate deficiency. A parallel pathway exists for methylation of homocysteine, in which choline, by way of betaine, is the methyl donor.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to determine whether choline deficiency results in a decreased capacity to methylate homocysteine.\n\n\nDESIGN\nC57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, or 35 mmol choline/kg diet for 3 wk. We then administered an oral methionine load to the animals and measured plasma homocysteine concentrations. Also, in a pilot study, we examined 8 men who were fed a diet providing 550 mg choline/d per 70 kg body weight for 10 d, followed by a diet providing almost no choline, until the subjects were clinically judged to be choline deficient or for <or=42 d. A methionine load was administered at the end of each dietary phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hours after the methionine load, choline-deficient mice had plasma homocysteine concentrations twice those of choline-fed mice. Four hours after the methionine load, clinically choline-depleted men had plasma homocysteine concentrations that were 35% greater than those in men not choline depleted.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that choline, like folate, plays an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine in humans and that response to a methionine load may be useful when assessing choline nutriture.",

         "Di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) is a common plasticizer and solvent that disrupts androgen-dependent male reproductive development in rats. In utero exposure to 500 mg/kg/day DBP on gestation days (GD) 12 to 21 decreases androgen biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in decreased fetal testicular testosterone levels. One consequence of prenatal DBP exposure is malformed epididymides in adult rats. Reduced fetal testosterone levels may be responsible for the malformation, since testosterone is required for Wolffian duct stabilization and their development into epididymides. Currently, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms of Wolffian duct differentiation. The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression associated with altered morphology of the proximal Wolffian duct following in utero exposure to DBP. Pregnant Crl:CD(R) (SD) rats were gavaged with corn oil vehicle or 500 mg/kg/day DBP from GD 12 to GD 19 or 21. There were only small morphological differences between control and DBP-exposed Wolffian ducts on GD 19. On GD 21, 89% of male fetuses in the DBP dose group showed marked underdevelopment of Wolffian ducts, characterized by decreased coiling. RNA was isolated from Wolffian ducts on GD 19 and 21. Together with empirical information, cDNA microarrays were used to help identify candidate genes that could be associated with the morphological changes observed on GD 21. These candidate genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Changes in mRNA expression were observed in genes within the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, the extracellular matrix, and in other developmentally conserved signaling pathways. On GD 19, immunolocalization of IGF-1 receptor protein demonstrated an increase in cytoplasmic expression in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells. There was also a variable decrease in androgen receptor protein in ductal epithelial cells on GD 19. This study provides insight into the effects of antiandrogens on the molecular mechanisms involved in Wolffian duct development. The altered morphology and changes in gene expression following DBP exposure are suggestive of altered paracrine interactions between ductal epithelial cells and the surrounding mesenchyme during Wolffian duct differentiation due to lowered testosterone production.",

         "Angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (a/LCI) is used to obtain quantitative, depth-resolved nuclear morphology measurements. We compare the average diameter and texture of cell nuclei in rat esophagus epithelial tissue to grading criteria established in a previous a/LCI study to prospectively grade neoplastic progression. We exploit the depth resolution of a/LCI to exclusively examine the basal layer of the epithelium, approximately 50 to 100 microm beneath the tissue surface, without the need for exogenous contrast agents, tissue sectioning, or fixation. The results of two studies are presented that compare the performance of two a/LCI modalities. Overall, the combined studies show 91% sensitivity and 97% specificity for detecting dysplasia, using histopathology as the standard. In addition, the studies enable the effects of dietary chemopreventive agents, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and curcumin, to be assessed by observing modulation in the incidence of neoplastic change. We demonstrate that a/LCI is highly effective for monitoring neoplastic change and can be applied to assessing the efficacy of chemopreventive agents in the rat esophagus.",

The authors found no evidence for a special role of phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli; it seems that fear relevance in general is more important than is the evolutionary age.

Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from the skin lesions, and the serum levels of total IgE and IL-4 were elevated in Ht-rats with dermatitis.

         "The dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems regulate blood pressure, in part, by affecting sodium transport in renal proximal tubules (RPTs). We have reported that activation of a D1-like receptor decreases AT1 receptor expression in the mouse kidney and in immortalized RPT cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The current studies were designed to test the hypothesis that activation of the AT1 receptor can also regulate the D1 receptor in RPT cells, and this regulation is aberrant in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Long-term (24 hours) stimulation of RPT cells with angiotensin II, via AT1 receptors increased total cellular D1 receptor protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in WKY but not in SHR cells. Short-term stimulation (15 minutes) with angiotensin II did not affect total cellular D1 receptor protein in either rat strain. However, in the short-term experiments, angiotensin II decreased cell surface membrane D1 receptor protein in WKY but not in SHR cells. D1 and AT1 receptors colocalized (confocal microscopy) and their coimmunoprecipitation was greater in WKY than in SHRs. However, AT1/D1 receptor coimmunoprecipitation was decreased by angiotensin II (10−8M/24 hours) to a similar extent in WKY (−22±8%) and SHRs (−22±12%). In summary, these studies show that AT1 and D1 receptors interact differently in RPT cells from WKY and SHRs. It is possible that an angiotensin II-mediated increase in D1 receptors and dissociation of AT1 from D1 receptors serve to counter regulate the long-term action of angiotensin II in WKY rats; different effects are seen in SHRs.",

         "The present study was undertaken to clarify the relationship between the p34cdc2 kinase activity of in vitro-aged or enucleated rat oocytes and the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) of microinjected cumulus cell nuclei. Wistar rat oocytes were placed in vitro up to 120 min after the animal was killed. The p34cdc2 kinase activity of the oocytes decreased in a time-dependent manner. The incidence of PCC was higher when nuclear injection into intact oocytes was completed in 15-45 min rather than 46-120 min. When rat oocytes were enucleated for subsequent nuclear injection, the p34cdc2 kinase activity transiently increased soon after enucleation but drastically decreased after 30 min. Removal of the cytoplasm instead of the meta-phase-plate did not affect the p34cdc2 kinase activity even after 60 min. PCC occurred in intact and cytoplasm-removed oocytes but not in enucleated oocytes. In contrast, oocytes from BDF1 mice exhibited a p34cdc2 kinase level twice that of rat oocytes and supported PCC despite enucleation. The p34cdc2 kinase level of intact rat oocytes was reduced to the equivalent level of aged (120 min) or enucleated (+60 min) oocytes by a 45 min treatment with roscovitine, an inhibitor of p34cdc2 kinase. None of the roscovitine-treated oocytes supported PCC while half of the control oocytes did. When rat oocytes were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, delayed inactivation of the p34cdc2 kinase was observed in the MG132-treated oocytes. A significantly higher proportion of the MG132-treated oocytes supported PCC when compared with the control oocytes. Moreover, a higher proportion of MG132-treated and enucleated oocytes carried two pseudo-pronuclei after cumulus cell injection and developed to the two-cell stage when compared with the enucleated oocytes at the telophase-II stage. These results suggest that the decreased level of p34cdc2 kinase activity in aged or enucleated rat oocytes is responsible for their inability to support PCC of microinjected donor cell nuclei and that inhibition of p34cdc2 kinase inactivation by chemicals such as MG132 is in part effective for rat oocytes to promote PCC and further development.",

To assess the performance of both techniques for ampicillin, 190 C. jejuni isolates from dairy cattle were utilized. A group of 172 C. jejuni isolates from dairy sources were used to compare the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur results indicate that microbroth dilution and agar dilution agree within +/-1 log2 dilution for 86.7% of the isolates tested. Ciprofloxacin had the highest level of agreement for isolates tested by both techniques, resulting in a kappa of 0.886 and 97.1% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution. The least agreement was observed in determining the susceptibility of isolates to ampicillin and erythromycin (82.1 and 79.7% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution). However, kappa statistics were considered to have good agreement for these antimicrobials. There were no significant differences in the summary statistics for any of the five antimicrobials evaluated for the isolates analysed by the percentage of resistant isolates, MIC50, MIC75 or MIC90 beyond +/-1 log2 dilution. There was no association in the classification of resistance by the testing methods employed. We also demonstrated that the quality control strain of C. jejuni ATCC 33650 performed in a consistent manner for both agar dilution and microbroth dilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMicrobroth dilution may be an acceptable alternative to agar dilution for determining susceptibility of C. jejuni in research or surveillance where flow of samples, labour efficiency and cost may restrict the use of agar dilution.",

         "Explicit computational formulas for the coefficients of the periodic normal forms for all codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles in generic autonomous ODEs are derived. They include second-order coefficients for the fold (limit point) bifurcation, as well as third-order coefficients for the flip (period-doubling) and Neimark--Sacker (torus) bifurcations. The formulas are independent of the dimension of the phase space and involve solutions of certain boundary-value problems on the interval [0,T], where T is the period of the critical cycle, as well as multilinear functions from the Taylor expansion of the right-hand sides near the cycle. The formulas allow us to distinguish between sub- and supercritical bifurcations, in agreement with earlier asymptotic expansions of the bifurcating solutions. Our formulation makes it possible to use robust numerical boundary-value algorithms based on orthogonal collocation, rather than shooting techniques, which greatly expands its applicability. The actual implementation is described in detail. We include three numerical examples, in which codim 2 singularities are detected along branches of codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles as zeros of the periodic normal form coefficients.",

         "Purpose: Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, the growth regulatory mechanisms of which\nare unknown.We investigated the involvement of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals in synovial\nsarcoma and evaluated the therapeutic effect of inhibiting the FGF signal.\nExperimental Design:The expression of 22 FGF and 4 FGF receptor (FGFR) genes in18 prima-\nry tumors and five cell lines of synovial sarcoma were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR.\nEffects of recombinant FGF2, FGF8, and FGF18 for the activation of mitogen-activated protein\nkinase (MAPK) and the growth of synovial sarcoma cell lines were analyzed. Growth inhibitory\neffects of FGFR inhibitors on synovial sarcoma cell lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo.\nResults: Synovial sarcoma cell lines expressed multiple FGF genes especially those expressed\nin neural tissues, among which FGF8 showed growth stimulatory effects in all synovial sarcoma\ncell lines. FGF signals in synovial sarcoma induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal ^\nregulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38MAPK but not c-Jun NH -terminal kinase. Disruption of the\nFGF signaling pathway in synovial sarcoma by specific inhibitors of FGFR caused cell cycle ar-\nrest leading to significant growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition by the\nFGFR inhibitor was associated with a down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 but not\np38MAPK, and an ERK kinase inhibitor also showed growth inhibitory effects for synovial sar-\ncoma, indicating that the growth stimulatory effect of FGF was transmitted through the ERK1/2.",

Standard serial and parallel turbo decoding\nThe decoding approach proposed in [3] operates in serial\nmode, i.e., the component decoders take turns generating the\nextrinsic values of the estimated information symbols, and\neach component decoder uses the extrinsic messages delivered\nby the last component decoder as the a priori values of the\ninformation symbols. The disadvantage of this scheme is high\ndecoding delay.

         "The  roots  of  Astragalus  membranaceus B     (Legumi-\nnosae) are amongst the most popular and important “Qi (pro-\nnounce  chee)  tonifying”  adaptogenic  herbs  in  China,  their\nuse  dates  back  more  than  2000  years,  and  are  recorded  in\nShen  Nong’s Materia  Medica.  According  to  ethnobotancical\ndata  collected  in  China,  A.  membranaceus has  been  pre-\nscribed  for  centuries  for  diarrhea,  frequent  colds,  sponta-\nneous  sweats,  fatigue,  and  edema.  Furthermore,  A.  mem-\nbranaceus is  alleged  to  possess  the  effects  of  antioxidative\ndamage,   immune-stimulation,   and antiviral infection.\nRecently,  it  has  received  more  attention  that  the  fact\nrecorded in ancient Chinese texts that A. membranaceus pos-\nsessed an antihypertensive effect by raising the yang qi of the\nspleen and kidney, since deﬁciency qi formed by the disorder\nof spleen and kidney is considered to be the basic pathogene-\nses  of  hypertension.   A  great  deal  of  studies  demonstrated\nthat  A.  membranaceus was  beneﬁcial  on  the  process  of  hy-\npertension  in  animals  and  humans,     and  a  cooperative\nmechanism  of\nrenin  angiotensin  aldosterone  system,\nkallikrein bradykinin system, and central neuropeptide   was\nused  to  explain  this  effect  of  A.  membranaceus.  We  also\nfound  in  the  past  experiments  that  the  administration  of  A.\nmembranaceus could attenuate the progression of blood pres-\nsure  in  spontaneously  hypertensive  rats  concomitant  with\nrestoration  of  baroreﬂex  sensitivity  and  reduction  of  Ca\nconcentration  in  lymphocyte  and  vascular  smooth  muscle\ncells  (VSMC).      Additionally,  in  vivo  experiment  had\ndemonstrated that A. membranaceus could induce the vasodi-\nlatation.    However,  there  is  no  experiment  evidence  avail-\nable  to  show  the  exact  mechanism  of  vasorelaxation  pro-\nduced by A. membranaceus. The present study is conducted\nto  elucidate  various  possible  mechanisms  in  vasomotor  re-\nsponse of A. membranaceus.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPlant  Material  and  Preparation  of  the  Extracts A.\nmembranaceus roots were collected in the northern region of\nGansu Province, China, in the autumn (2001) and identiﬁed\nby the Quality Assessment of Di’ao Group, Sichuang, China.\nAnd a voucher specimen was deposited in the Academic De-\npartment of Di’ao Group (STQ-C-00203).\nA. membranaceus roots were air dried. A crude extract was\nprepared  by  decoction  of  2.010  g  in  500 ml  water  for  3\ntimes (90 min per time). The obtained extract was combined,\nﬁltered  and  concentrated.  Then  all  the  aqueous  extract  was\nextracted  with  400 ml  ethanol  (75%  and  85%)  twice.  After\nthe ethanol was retrieved, the active fractions were recovered,\nﬁltered  and  lyophilized  (yield  0.28%).  Consequently,  the\nﬁnal  extract  was  used  in  the  study  after  dissolution  in  dis-\ntilled water at 37 °C and stirred for 60 min.\nChemicals Phenylephrine  (PE),  acetylcholine  (ACh),   -\nN(w)-nitro-arginine  methyl  ester  (L-NAME),  methylthion-\ninium  chloride  (MC),  phosphoramidon,  ethylene  glycol-bis\n[b-aminoethyl  ether]-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic  acid  (EGTA),\ncaffeine  and  phorbol-12,13-diacetate  (PD)  were  purchased\nfrom  Sigma  Chemical  Co.  (St.  Louis,  MO,  U.S.A.).  They\nwere  dissolved\nin  distilled  water  and  diluted  with\nKrebs–Henseleit  (K–H)  solution  before  use.  All  chemicals\nwere of the highest purity available.\nExperiment  Animals The  investigation  conformed  to\nthe  Chinese  Regulation  for  Administration  of  Laboratory\nAnimal  (SSTC  1988/2).  Health  male  Sprague–Dawley  rats\nweighing  260—280 g  (Laboratory  Animal  Center  of  Zhe-\njiang  College  of  Traditional  Chinese  Medicine,  Hangzhou,\nChina) were housed in conventional cages with free access to\nwater and rodent chow at the controlled temperature and hu-\nmidity with a 12-h light/dark cycle.\nPreparation of Thoracic Arterial Rings from Sprague–\nDawley  Rats Rats  were  euthanized  by  decapitation  using\nsmall animal guillotine. The thoracic aorta was immediately\nisolated  and  immersed  in  oxygenated  K–H  solution  4 °C  of\nthe  following  composition  (in  m ):  NaCl  118.3;  KCl  4.7;\nMgSO  1.2; KH PO  1.2; NaHCO  25.0; CaCl  2.5; Glucose\n11.0.  Then  the  adherent  connective  tissue  was  cleaned  and\nblood  vessel  was  cut  into  3—4 mm  rings,  with  the  special\ncare  of  avoiding  damage  of  endothelium.  In  some  prepara-\ntions, endothelium was mechanically removed by gently rub-\nbing  the  lumen.  The  rings  were  mounted  horizontally  be-\ntween two stirrups in organ bath ﬁlled with 10 ml K–H solu-\ntion  at  37 °C,  ventilated  continuously  with  95%  O  and  5%\nCO . The isometric tension was recorded with a force trans-\nducer  (JZ101,  metrical  range:  0—5.0 g)  and  MedLab  5.0v\nrecording system (Nanjing Medease Science and Technology\nCo. Ltd).\nExperimental  Procedure  of  Isometric  Tension Rings\nwere equilibrated for 60 min at 2.0 g resting tension, and then\nchallenged with KCl (6.010\n) at least 3 times until a re-\nproducible maximal contractile response was obtained. After\na  further  equilibration  period  of  30 min,  the  integrity  of  the\nendothelium was assessed in all preparations by determining\nthe ability of ACh (1.010\n) to induce more than 80% re-\nlaxation  of  rings  pre-contracted  with  PE  (1.010\n).  The\nendothelium  was  considered  to  be  removed  when  there  was\nless than 10% relaxation response to ACh.\nProtocol 1: Effects of A. membranaceus on Vascular Tone:\nThe ﬁrst series of the experiments were conducted to assess\nendothelium-dependent  or  independent  effects  of  A.  mem-\nbranaceus on isolated aortic rings. When the tension was at\nresting  state  or  reached  a  plateau  induced  by  PE  (3.0\n),  A.  membranaceus (2.010  —2.010   g/l)  was\ncumulatively added into the organ bath with 10 min interval.\nThe  rings  with  intact  or  denuded  endothelium  were  always\ntested in parallel.\nProtocol  2:  Endothelium-Independent  Vasomotor  Re-\nsponse by A. membranaceus: The second series of the exper-\niments  were  designed  to  determine  the  underlying  mecha-\nnisms  of  A.  membranaceus-induced  vasomotor  response  in\naortic rings without endothelium. In contrast to the response\nof  A.  membranaceus (2.010  —2.010   g/l)  to  PE,  KCl\n(3.010\n)  was  also  employed  to  constrict  the  denuded\naortic rings. A plateau contractile response to KCl or PE was\nalso obtained as a time control.\n), PD (1.010\nAdditionally,  after  the  preparations  were  serially  washed\nand equilibrated for 60 min by Ca  -free medium (m : NaCl\n118.3, KCl 4.7, KH PO  1.2, MgSO  1.2, NaHCO  25, Glu-\ncose 11.0, EGTA 0.05), PE (3.010\n)\n(an  activator  of  protein  kinase  C,  PKC),    or  caffeine\n(2.510\n) (an activator of ryanodine receptor)    was used\nto contract the denuded rings. In order to explore the proba-\nble  effect  of  extracellular  Ca   inﬂow,  2.5 m  CaCl  was\nadded  after  PE  stimulated  the  rings.  Then  the  effect  of  A.\nmembranaceus (6.010   g/l)  was  tested.  A  time  control\n(same protocol as above except for the omission of A. mem-\nbranaceus to  the  second  application  of  PE,  PD  or  caffeine)\nwas  always  run  in  parallel.  Following  the  initial  control  re-\nsponse in Ca  -free medium and before the second test con-\ntraction (to PE or caffeine), a 6.010\nKCl-induced con-\ntraction  in  K–H  solution  was  obtained  to  reﬁll  the  Ca\nstores in the vascular tissues.\nProtocol 3: Endothelium-Dependent Vasomotor Response\nby A. membranaceus: In the third series of experiments, the\npotential inﬂuence of A. membranaceus on PE-induced vaso-\nmotor function in the intact rings was examined. For pretreat-\nment,  endothelium-intact  rings  were  incubated  with  L-\nNAME (1.010\n) (a speciﬁc inhibitor of nitric oxide syn-\nthase), MC (1.010\n) (an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase)\nfor 15 min    and phosphoramidon (5.010\n) (an inhibitor\nof  endothelin  converting  enzyme)  for  20 min    before  ad-\nministration  of  PE.  Then  the  response  curves  of  A.  mem-\nbranaceus were recorded. The rings with or without the treat-\nment of inhibitors were always tested in parallel.\nStatistical  Analysis Relaxant  responses  were  expressed\nas the percentage decreases of the magnitude of the contrac-\ntion  induced  by  PE  or  KCl  (100%)  before  the  application\nof  vasodilators,  and  the  contractile  responses  as  the  ratio  of\nthe  responses  following  and  before  the  application  of  A.\nmembranaceus (second  response/ﬁrst  response).  All  results\nare  expressed  as  meanS.E.M.  Statistical  analysis  was  per-\nformed  with  t-test  or  ANOVA  followed  by  Newman–Keuls\ntest. Differences were accepted as statistically signiﬁcant at p\nvalues 0.05 (GraphPad Prism).\nRESULTS\nPE  (1.010\n)  induced  a  similar  sustained  contraction\nof  aortic  rings  in  each  group  with  a  peak  tension  of  about\n3.110.27 g  in  intact  aortic  rings  and  3.020.19 g  in  de-\nnuded ones.\nEffects  of  A.  membranaceus on  the  Vasotension All\ndoses (2.010  —2.010   g/l) of A. membranaceus exhib-\nited  negligible  vasomotor  actions  on  aortic  rings  with  or\nwithout  endothelium  at  resting  tension  (Fig.  1).  A.  mem-\nbranaceus (2.010  —2.010   g/l)  produced  dose-depen-\ndent  relaxation  in  endothelium-denuded  rings  (Fig.  2),  after\nthe  plateau  tension  induced  by  PE.  However,  in  PE-precon-\ntracted  endothelium-intact  rings,  low  doses  (2.010  —\n6.010   g/l) of A. membranaceus showed a more signiﬁcant\nrelaxation than that in denuded ones (Fig. 2), while high dose\n(2.010  —2.010   g/l) of the extract induced a transient\ncontraction (Figs. 2, 3).\nEndothelium-Independent  Vasodilatation  by  A.  mem-\nIn  contrast  to  the  effect  on  PE-contracted  en-\nbranaceus\ndothelium-denuded rings in K–H solution, A. membranaceus\n(2.010  —2.010   g/l)  had  no  dilatation-effect  on  rings\nstimulated by KCl (3.010\n) (Fig. 4).\nAnd in the experiment with Ca  -free medium, aortic con-\ntraction  elicited  by  PE,  caffeine  or  PD  was  decreased  sub-\nstantially, as these vascular contractions in Ca  -free medium\nare mediated only via the release of Ca   from the intracellu-\nlar stores or phosphorylation of myosin light chain. A. mem-\nbranaceus (6.010   g/l)  could  inhibit  the  contraction  in-\nduced  by  PE  (3.010\n),  but  not  block  the  extracellular\nCa   inﬂow,  because  2.5 m  CaCl  induced  a  similar  en-\nhancement of contraction by PE, compared with the control\n(95.842.63%  vs. 96.961.87%,  p0.05).  Furthermore,  A.\nmembranaceus (6.010   g/l) failed to induce an attenuation\nof  contractile  response  by  PD  (1.010\n)  and  caffeine\n(2.510\n) (Fig. 5).\nEndothelium-Dependent  Vasomotor  Effects  by  A.\nmembranaceus Pre-incubation  of  the  intact  rings  with  L-\nNAME  (1.010\n)  markedly,  incompletely  inhibited  A.\nmembranaceus (6.010   g/l)-induced  relaxation  from  36.0\nto 7.3% (Fig. 6). Similarly, MC (1.010\n) also showed an\ninhibition  of  endothelium-dependent  vasodilatation  from\n36.0  to  8.0%  (Fig.  6).  Thus,  NO  signaling  might  play  a\nmajor, but not full role in the vasodilatation effect of A. mem-\nbranaceus.\nWhen the dose of A. membranaceus in the organ bath was\nstepwise raised to 2.010  —2.010   g/l, a transient con-\ntraction  could  be  observed  in  endothelium-intact  rings.  Pre-\ntreatment  of  endothelium-intact  rings  with  phosphoramidon\n(5.010\n)  signiﬁcantly  attenuated  the  transient  contrac-\ntion response (Fig. 3).\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study ﬁrst and detailedly explored the in vitro\nvascular effects of A. membranaceus in aortic rings isolated\nfrom rats. In the course of the study, a number of novel ob-\nservations  had  been  made,  which  contribute  to  better  scien-\ntiﬁc  understanding  of  their  therapeutic  use  for  antihyperten-\nsion associated with Qi deﬁciency caused by the disorder of\nspleen and kidney in China.\nFirst, although neurohumoral factors may contribute to an-\ntihypertension for the crude extract of A. membranaceus ob-\nserved previously,   it is apparent that direct endothelium-de-\npendent  and  independent  vasorelaxation  should  be  promi-\nnently taken into account according to this study.\nSecond,  A.  membranaceus dose-dependently  dilated  en-\ndothelium-denuded  rings  contracted  with  PE.  However,  the\nagent had no effect on the vessel contracted by KCl. The cel-\nlular  mechanism  of  contraction  involved  in  the  response  to\nKCl and PE is different. KCl induce Ca   inﬂux via voltage-\ndependent  Ca   channel,  which  further  activate  Ca  -in-\nduced Ca   release through ryanodine-receptor. PE increase\nintracellular  Ca   concentration  with  two  mechanisms,  1)\nthrough  receptor-gated  Ca   channels;  2)  mobilizes  Ca\nfrom  intracellular  stores  via the  inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate\n(IP )  receptor  or  induces  secondly  myosin  light  chain  phos-\nphorylation via activating PKC.       That is, the vasorelaxant\naction of A. membranaceus seems to occur in a receptor-de-\npendent manner in SMVC of rat aortas. However, the result\nthat A. membranaceus failed to inhibit the contraction caused\nby addition of CaCl  in Ca   free solution was probably only\ndue to its effects on the intracellular pathways. This hypothe-\nsis was conﬁrmed in the further experiments that the contrac-\ntions induced by PD and caffeine in Ca  -free medium were\nnot  affected  by  A.  membranaceus equally.  Thus,  it  appears\nthat the IP -induced Ca   release channels might be the site\nof action for A. membranaceus on endothelium-removed aor-\ntas.\nThird,  NO  is  a  potent  vasodilator  synthesized  in  the  en-\ndothelium    by  NO  synthase,  and  causes  VSMC  relaxation\nthrough  the  activation  of  soluble  guanylate  cyclase.    The\npresent  study  demonstrated  that  the  extract  of  A.  mem-\nbranaceus dose-dependently  inhibited  the  contraction  in-\nduced  by  PE  in  intact  aorta  isolated  from  rats.  This  vasore-\nlaxant  action  was  mostly  inhibited  by  treatment  with  L-\nNAME  or  MC.  Endothelium-dependent  relaxation  of  A.\nmembranaceus seemed  to  be  associated  with  NO  signaling\nvia guanylate cyclase activation since both L-NAME and MC\ncould  attenuate  this  response.  This  result  was  supported  by\nother studies which had shown that A. membranaceus could\nincrease the plasma level of NO    and induce the release of\nNO  from  VSMC  in  vitro  by  NO-soluble  guanylate  cyclase-\ncyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway.\nFinally,  it  was  also  observed  that  high  dose  (2.010  —\n2.010   g/l) A. membranaceus induced a transient contrac-\ntion  in  arterial  rings  pre-constricted  by  PE.  This  result  was\nidentical with that obtained in another report where treatment\nwith  high  dose  of  A.  membranaceus reversibly  increased\nblood pressure of patients without hypertension previously.\nThe  mechanism  underlying  is  under  investigation.

         "In this report, we use zebraﬁsh as a model system to understand the importance of CD146 in vascular\ndevelopment. Endothelial-speciﬁc expression of CD146 was veriﬁed by whole-mount in situ hybridization.\nSuppression of CD146 protein expression by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) resulted in poorly\ndeveloped intersomitic vessels (ISVs). In CD146 morphants, we observed a lack of blood ﬂow through the\nISV region, despite that ﬂuorescence microangiography showed that the ISVs were present. This ﬁnding\nsuggests that the lumens of the developing ISVs may be too narrow for proper circulation. Additionally,\nremodeling of the caudal vein plexus into functional vascular tubes appeared to be affected. Suppression of\nCD146 protein expression resulted in a circulation shunt that caused the circulation to by-pass part of the\ncaudal artery/vein system. The same vascular defects were recapitulated by using a second morpholino\noligonucleotide. This morphant expressed a truncated CD146 protein with amino acids V32 to T57 at the N\nterminus deleted in an in-frame manner. This region, therefore, is likely to contain elements critical for\nCD146 function. This study provides the ﬁrst in vivo functional assessment of CD146 in embryonic\ndevelopment by showing that knockdown of CD146 protein expression severely hinders vascular\ndevelopment in zebraﬁsh.

In fact, it was deter-\nmined that CD146 was the antigen\nrecognized by a highly endothelial-\nspeciﬁc monoclonal antibody called\nP1H12 (Solovey et al., 2001).\nAlthough its cellular function is rel-\natively poorly understood, CD146 is\nbelieved to play a role in cell– cell ad-\nhesion. It has been shown by immuno-\nhistochemical studies that CD146 is\nlocalized at the intercellular junctions\nof conﬂuent endothelial cells in vitro\n(Bardin et al., 1996a, 2001), although\nCD146 does not appear to form part of\nthe tight junctions (Lampugnani and\nDejana, 1997) nor the adherens junc-\ntions (Bardin et al., 2001). In addition,\nthe cell surface expression of CD146\nwas shown to increase by twofold as\nhuman umbilical vein endothelial\ncells (HUVECs) grew from subconﬂu-\nency to complete conﬂuency (Bardin et\nal., 2001). Furthermore, overexpres-\nsion of CD146 in ﬁbroblasts decreased\nparacellular permeability (Bardin et\nal., 2001), whereas treatment of con-\nﬂuent human microvascular endothe-\nlial cells (HMVECs) with monoclonal\nantibody P1H12 increased permeabil-\nity to albumin in vitro (Solovey et al.,\n2001).\nThe nature of CD146 adhesive prop-\nerty has been addressed in vitro\nmainly through cell-aggregation and\nsolid-phase binding assays. Results\nfrom these experiments suggest that\nCD146 confers cell– cell adhesion by\nmeans of interactions with a hetero-\nphilic ligand that has yet to be identi-\nﬁed (Johnson et al., 1997; Shih et al.,\n1997). This interaction is divalent-cat-\nion independent and can be inhibited\nby a recombinant full-length CD146\nprotein and a polyclonal antiserum\nraised against CD146 (Johnson et al.,\n1997; Shih et al., 1997).\nIn addition to its potential role in\ncell– cell adhesion, CD146 has also\nbeen shown to be a signaling molecule\nthat induces several intracellular mo-\nlecular events upon cross-linking by a\nmonoclonal antibody. For example,\ntreatment of HMVEC with the mono-\nclonal antibody P1H12 caused caveo-\nlin to redistribute from the cell periph-\nery to the cytoplasm and nuclear entry\nof the transcription factor NF-B (So-\nlovey et al., 2001). In addition, anti-\nbody-mediated cross-linking of CD146\nin vitro recruited Fyn to the cytoplas-\nmic domain of CD146, triggered a\nphospholipase C – dependent store-\noperated calcium mobilization and in-\nduced phosphorylation of cellular pro-\nteins such as Pyk2, FAK, CAS, and\npaxillin (Anfosso et al., 1998, 2001;\nSolovey et al., 2001). However, CD146\nhas not been shown to interact with\nother cell-surface adhesive molecules\nsuch as VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, or 1\nintegrin (Bardin et al., 2001).\nRecently, a fully humanized CD146\nmonoclonal antibody ABX-MA1 (Mills\net al., 2002) and a mouse monoclonal\nantibody AA98 (Yan et al., 2003) were\ndeveloped. When tested in mouse tu-\nmor models, both antibodies inhibited\ntumor growth and metastasis and re-\nduced microvascular density in tu-\nmors (Mills et al., 2002; Yan et al.,\n2003). Of interes",

         "Cardiac troponin I is a phosphorylation target for endothelin-\nactivated protein kinase C. Earlier work in cardiac myocytes\nexpressing nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I provided\nevidence that protein kinase C-mediated cardiac troponin I phos-\nphorylation accelerates relaxation. However, replacement with the\nslow skeletal isoform also alters the myofilament pH response and\nthe Ca   transient, which could influence endothelin-mediated\nrelaxation. Here, differences in the Ca   transient could not explain\nthe divergent relaxation response to endothelin in myocytes\nexpressing cardiac versus slow skeletal troponin I nor could activa-\ntion of Na /H  exchange. Three separate clusters within cardiac\ntroponin I are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and we set out to\ndetermine the contribution of the Thr    and Ser  /Ser   clusters to\nthe endothelin-mediated contractile response. Myocyte replace-\nment with a cardiac troponin I containing a Thr    substituted with\nthe Pro residue found in slow skeletal troponin I resulted in pro-\nlonged relaxation in response to acute endothelin compared with\ncontrol myocytes. Ser  /Ser   also is a target for protein kinase C\nphosphorylation of purified cardiac troponin I, and although this\ncluster was not acutely phosphorylated in intact myocytes, signifi-\ncant phosphorylation developed within 1 h after adding endothelin.\nReplacement of Ser  /Ser   with Ala indicated that this cluster con-\ntributes significantly to relaxation during more prolonged endothe-\nlin stimulation. Overall, results with these mutants provide evi-\ndence that Thr    plays an important role in the acute acceleration\nof relaxation, whereas Ser  /Ser   contributes to relaxation during\nmore prolonged activation of protein kinase C by endothelin.\nProtein kinase C (PKC)  activation is an important pathway involved\nin modulating cardiac contractile function (1–5). A number of end tar-\nget proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling are phospho-\nrylated in response to PKC activation, including the L-type Ca   chan-\nnel (6, 7) and myofilament proteins such as cardiac troponin I (cTnI)\n(8 –11), cardiac troponin T (10, 12), and myosin light chain 2 (MLC ) (8,\n13, 14). The contribution of each end target to the contractile response\nto PKC is not well understood. Our laboratory is interested in under-\nstanding the role of cTnI in the PKC-mediated contractile function\nresponse. Increased PKC expression is observed in failing human hearts\n(15, 16), and the relationship between PKC and cTnI phosphorylation\nmay exert an important influence on cardiac function under physiolog-\nical and pathophysiological conditions (17).\nEarlier work demonstrated that cTnI phosphorylation is correlated\nwith the positive inotropic response to ET (4, 8, 18). Accelerated relax-\nation also is observed in response to PKC activation by ET in myocytes\nexpressing cTnI (4). PKC phosphorylation of purified cTnI decreases\nmyofilament Ca   sensitivity in reconstituted myofilaments (11), and\nthis desensitization is expected to contribute to the accelerated relax-\nation. In contrast, peak shortening is diminished and relaxation is\ndelayed rather than accelerated in response to ET when endogenous\ncTnI is replaced with nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I\n(ssTnI) in adult myocytes. These results are consistent with the idea that\ncTnI phosphorylation enhances peak myocyte shortening and acceler-\nates relaxation rate in response to PKC activation by ET. However,\nssTnI expression in adult myocytes also increases myofilament Ca\nsensitivity and slows the Ca   transient (19, 20). Thus, the differential\nresponse to ET observed in myocytes expressing cTnI versus ssTnI may\nresult from the direct actions of cTnI phosphorylation on shortening\nand relaxation or from alterations in the Ca   transient induced by\nssTnI expression.\nOne goal of the present study is to establish whether PKC-mediated\ncTnI phosphorylation acts directly to accelerate relaxation or is\nexplained by parallel alterations in cellular Ca  . Calcium and shorten-\ning responses are measured simultaneously during the ET response for\nthese experiments. Stimulation frequency also alters the Ca   transient,\nwith accelerated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca   uptake observed at\nhigher pacing frequencies (21). The relative contribution of phospho-\nrylated cTnI to the ET-induced relaxation response may decrease as\npacing frequency increases in the event that alterations in cellular Ca\nare primarily responsible for this relaxation response. Thus, the contri-\nbution of cTnI phosphorylation to the ET-induced relaxation response\nis examined over a range of frequencies.\nA second goal of our study was to differentiate between cTnI phos-\nphorylation-induced and alkalosis-induced changes in the ET-mediated\ncontractile performance response. Previous investigators showed that\nET increases Na /H  exchange via PKC (22, 23). The ensuing alkalosis\nincreases myofilament Ca   sensitivity (24), and ET-induced",

         "This paper documents a study, carried out in the academic\nyear 2003-2004, on ﬁfteen factors that may inﬂuence per-\nformance on a ﬁrst year object-oriented programming mod-\nule. The factors included prior academic experience, prior\ncomputer experience, self-perception of programming per-\nformance and comfort level on the module and speciﬁc cog-\nnitive skills. The study found that a student’s perception of\ntheir understanding of the module had the strongest corre-\nlation with programming performance, r = 0.76, p < 0.01.\nIn addition, Leaving Certiﬁcate (LC) mathematics and sci-\nence scores were shown to have a strong correlation with\nperformance. A regression module, based upon a student’s\nperception of their understanding of the module, gender, LC\nmathematics score and comfort level was able to account for\n79% of the variance in programming performance results.\nK.3.2 [Computer and Information Science Education]:\nComputer science education\nHuman Factors, Measurement, Performance\nCS1, Programming, Predictors\nStudent retention on third-level (post high school or equiv-\nalent) Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology\n(IT) courses is a signiﬁcant problem. Students ﬁnd com-\nputer programming diﬃcult and struggle to master the core\nconcepts. A multi-national, multi-institutional study on the\nprogramming skills of ﬁrst year CS students found that stu-\ndents struggled to achieve an average above 30% on assess-\nments administered as part of their study [14]. Further-\nmore, introductory programming modules tend to have a\n$\nvery high student to lecturer ratio (100:1 or greater) and\noften lecturers do not know how well students are doing un-\ntil after the ﬁrst assessment. In general the ﬁrst assessment\ndoes not take place until six or eight weeks after the mod-\nule has commenced and given the typically high number of\nstudents, marking the assessments can take a considerable\nlength of time. At this stage, it may be too late to intervene\nto prevent struggling students from failing. Even if inter-\nvention is possible, a lecturer is unlikely to know a student\nwell enough or be able to identify individual student prob-\nlems and therefore recognize the most suitable interventions\nto make.\nThe research documented in this paper is part of a lon-\ngitudinal study on early identiﬁable factors that inﬂuence\nperformance on an introductory programming module.\nIf\nsuch factors can be identiﬁed then it may be possible to de-\nvelop a tool to provide an early diagnosis of a student’s likely\nperformance on a programming module. Interested parties\ncould use the tool to make more informed decisions on ap-\npropriate courses of action and to decide upon personalized\ninterventions that foster a student’s intellectual strengths.\nWhile a considerable amount of research has been carried\nout on factors that aﬀect programming performance our in-\nterest is on factors that aﬀect programming performance\non an introductory third-level object-oriented programming\nmodule where such factors can be determined early in the\nacademic year. These factors can be categorized as: (1)\nprevious academic and computer experience, (2) cognitive\nskills, (3) personal information and (4) experience on the\nmodule. A brief review of some research studies in each of\nthese categories is presented next.\nPrevious academic experience and programming experi-\nence have often been cited as predictors of programming suc-\ncess. Several studies have found that mathematical ability\nand exposure to maths courses are important predictors of\nperformance on introductory computer science modules [2,\n3, 4, 6, 13, 19]. Similarly, although less studied, performance\nin and experience of science subjects has also been shown\nto be important [2, 19]. Studies have also found prior pro-\ngramming experience and non-programming computer ex-\nperience (for example, experience of computer applications,\nemailing, game playing and surﬁng the web) to be related\nto programming performance [9, 10, 6, 4, 18].\nThe role of cognitive factors in programming has also re-\nceived research attention. Certain cognitive factors, includ-\ning problem-solving, abstract reasoning, problem translation\nskills, logical ability and cognitive style have been identiﬁed\nas possible predictors [7, 12, 11, 15].\nNumerous studies have been carried out on demographic\nand self-reported personal information. Some studies have\nexamined speciﬁc attributes related to study, for example\npreference for working alone or in a group to solve a pro-\ngramming problem and encouragement or support from oth-\ners to study computers [4, 2, 8].\nIn recent times researchers have examined the relation-\nship between students’ expectations of and experiences on\nan introductory computing module.

The grade a student expected to achieve in\nan introductory module was found to be the most impor-\ntant indicator of performance in another recent study[17].\nA recent longitudinal study found that the most important\npredictor of students’ performance on an introductory com-\nputer science course was comfort level, determined by the\ndegree of anxiety a student felt about the course [4].\nAlthough a considerable number of research studies have\nexamined factors that inﬂuence programming performance,\ncomparisons between the various studies and application of\nthe results are diﬃcult because the studies are carried out\nusing diﬀerent parameters. These parameters include:\n• the type of students (novice to experienced program-\nmers, academic students to employees),\n• the content of the course (some courses are solely pro-\ngramming courses while others are introductory com-\nputing courses),\n• the programming language being taught (older studies\ntend to be based on procedural languages),\n• the educational setting (many of the research studies\nare based on the US educational system) and\n• the reference criterion (for example continuous assess-\nment, end-of-year exam, job performance).\nIn the rest of this paper we describe our study, which\nbuilds upon existing research, in particular the work of [2,\n4], to identify early factors that inﬂuence performance of\nﬁrst year students, on an introductory object-oriented pro-\ngramming module, using the Java programming language.\nThe course is based on the Irish educational system and\nthe reference criterion is the overall result achieved on the\nmodule.\nThe introductory programming module at our university\nis composed of a one and a half hour Problem-Based Learn-\ning (PBL) workshop, a one and a half hour laboratory ses-\nsion and three one-hour lectures per week over two semesters.\nStudents in Ireland do not study programming in secondary\nschool and the majority of students taking this module have\nrecently completed second level education.\nSelection of factors for this study was restricted for a num-\nber of reasons, including availability of participants, length\nof completion time needed for each instrument and stage in\nyear.

         "ightly controlled exposure of tissue factor (TF) to com-\nponents of the plasma coagulation cascade is important\nfor maintenance of normal rheological properties of blood.\nFailure to manipulate TF levels available for the initiation of\nblood clotting leads to thrombotic or bleeding disorders in\nhumans. Circulating monocytes are presumably the major cell\ntype that respond to variable stimuli by developing coagulant\nactivity  through the expression of TF.\nOriginally, intersubject variability in developing of mono-\ncyte TF activity was described by Østerud et al.  By compar-\ning lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte TF activity\nand tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) production in a whole\nblood system, an up to a 50-fold difference between individ-\nuals was observed.  This finding was defined as the “high–\nlow responder phenomenon.”  Also noteworthy, the individ-\nual usually remains a high responder (HR) or low responder\n(LR) for several years.    Later, high intersubject variability in\ncytokine production by LPS-stimulated monocytes was dem-\nonstrated.  It was also shown that patients with high levels of\nTNF- production were more susceptible to heart transplant\nrejection.  Monocytes isolated from septic shock patient\nsurvivors revealed higher TNF- production than monocytes\nfrom nonsurvivors.\nMany studies have been undertaken to describe the signifi-\ncance of this phenomenon, but so far, no general explanation has\nbeen found. Diverse plasma factors and direct cell interactions\nplay an important role in the development of monocyte TF\nactivity.       High expression of monocyte TF activity is asso-\nciated with higher risk of acute coronary syndrome.\nPlatelets have been suggested to be responsible for\ninducing monocyte TF activity.   Platelet-rich plasma\ninduced significantly higher TF activity in LPS-stimulated\nmonocytes than platelet-poor plasma.   Moreover, when\nblood cells without platelets from HRs were mixed with\nplatelet-rich plasma of an LR, LPS-induced TF activity\nwas reduced up to 76% compared with an autologous\nsystem.   It was shown that granulocytes enhance LPS-\ninduced monocyte TF activity in a platelet-dependent\nreaction involving P-selectin, platelet factor 4, platelet-\nactivating factor, hydroxyl-eicosatetraenoic acid, and\nplatelet-derived growth factor.\nHere we report several observations concerning the rela-\ntionships between intracellular- and membrane-located TF\nantigen in resting and LPS-stimulated monocytes in groups of\nHRs and LRs, using fluorescence-activated cell sorter\n(FACS) analysis, fluorescence confocal microscopy, in-cell\nWestern assay, and immunoblotting. In response to LPS\nstimulation, we clearly found different patterns of intracellu-\nlar accumulation and externalization of TF onto the surface of\nMNCs isolated from whole blood of HRs and LRs.\nThe LPS-induced responses of MNCs from individuals enrolled\nin our study have been repeatedly assessed to determine their\nindividual TF activity and concentration levels of TNF-. These\nhealthy individuals were allocated to HR or LR groups accord-\ning to criteria developed in our laboratory.   Briefly, healthy\nvolunteers were defined as HRs if their MNC-TF activity\nexceeded 20 mU/10  cells and their plasma TNF- concentra-\ntion levels were 3 ng/mL taken from whole blood stimulated\nwith LPS for 2 hours. We assigned individuals with these\nparameters lower than indicated above to the LR group.\nMeasurements of TF procoagulant activity in lysates of\nMNCs isolated from ex vivo LPS-stimulated whole blood\nrevealed 2 distinct responses. In HRs, LPS stimulation\ninduced significantly higher values of MNC-TF activity than\nin LRs after 2 hours (50.114.3 versus 20.94.2 mU/10\ncells; P0.05) and 4 hours (56.016.3 mU/10  versus\n21.24.9 mU/10  cells; P0.05; Figure 1). We found no\nincrease in TF activity in MNC lysates from time-matched\nnonstimulated samples (Figure 1).\nBecause the HR and LR phenomenon encompasses not only\ndifferences in monocyte TF activity but also in cytokine produc-\ntion,  we studied the reactivity of whole blood to LPS stimula-\ntion with respect to TNF- production. Analyses of TNF-\nconcentration in plasma obtained from LPS-stimulated whole\nblood showed that in HRs, the levels of TNF-were constantly\nhigher during the experimental time course (3255.6108.7\nversus 2308.8264.6 pg/mL, P 0.05 at 2 hours; and\n4551.0275.4 versus 2977.0496.5 pg/mL at 4 hours, P0.05;\nFigure 2). Levels of TNF- were negligible on baseline and in\nnonstimulated time-matched samples (Figure 2).\nThe differences of MNC-TF activity and the production of\nTNF- in our experimental model could not be caused by\nvariations in degree of cell death because the number of dead\ncells measured by trypan blue exclusion assay did not differ\nbetween groups and was within 3% of the total cell count.\nThe variable degrees of responsiveness to LPS treatment,\ncharacterized by significantly elevated TF activity in MNC\nlysates in HRs,\nthe comparisons of\nintracellular and surface TF antigen levels under resting and\nstimulated conditions in these individuals.\nled us to carry out\nAfter we characterized the suitability of available antibodies\nfor detection of denatured TF antigen, immunoblots of MNC\nlysates using mouse anti-human TF monoclonal antibodies\nrevealed a strong immunopositive 43-kDa band and several\nweaker bands that migrated between 50 and 60 kDa, which\nare most likely secondary antibodies reactive with mouse\nimmunoglobulin heavy chain. Mature TF is a protein con-\ntaining 263 amino acids with predicted molecular weight 33\nkDa. However, it is known to be post-translationally modified\nby glycosylation and phosphorylation, which retards its\nelectrophoretic mobility. To identify the TF band on the\nimmunoblots, we depleted TF expression by RNA interfer-\nence. Immunoblots of extracts from human cervical adeno-\ncarcinoma cell line (HeLa; ATCC No. CCL-2) cells trans-\nfected with anti-TF small interfering RNAs (siRNA) revealed\nthat the strong 43-kDa band was significantly reduced com-\npared with HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA. At the\nsame time, we found no reduction in the intensities of the\nweak 50 to 60 kDa bands. The intensity of the signal from\nimmunopositive bands of an irrelevant protein epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor displayed no differences between\nthese samples (Figure IA, available online at http://atvb.\nahajournals.org). This ascertains that monoclonal antibodies\nrevealed TF as 43-kDa band.\nBecause we planned to use immunostaining-based methods for\nnative TF antigen detection (such as fluorescence-activated cell\nsorting, fluorescence confocal microscopy and in-cell Western\nassay), we applied RNA interference against TF expression in\nplated HeLa cells. Similarly, the same antibodies detected a 3-fold\nreduction of the in-cell Western assay signal intensity in the wells\nthat contained HeLa cells transfected with siRNA against TF when\ncompared with cells transfected with control siRNA. The signal\nfrom the in-cell Western assay against GAPDH showed no differ-\nences in the same wells (Figure IB).\nTo characterize levels of TF antigen on the surface and\ninterior of resting and LPS-stimulated monocytes from HRs\nand LRs, we chose FACS analyses of whole blood, fluores-\ncence confocal microscopy, and in-cell Western assay of\npermeabilized and nonpermeabilized MNCs.\nData of FACS analyses revealed striking differences in\nsurface TF antigen levels in LPS-stimulated monocytes of\nHRs and LRs. The population of CD14  cells, expressing TF\non their surface, was significantly lower in LRs (11.21.2%)\nthan in HRs (32.03.5%) after 2 hours of LPS stimulation\n(P0.05; Figure 3A and 3B). The mean fluorescence inten-\nsity (MFI) was also significantly lower in the LRs (5.40.4\narbitrary units [AU]) than in the HRs (7.10.5 AU; P0.05)\nat 2 hours of LPS stimulation (Figure 3C). More rapid\nexternalization of TF antigen on the surface of monocytes\nwas already seen in the HR group after 1 hour of LPS\nstimulation, but these differences did not reach statistical signif-\nicance between groups. Time-matched nonstimulated samples\nhad no significant differences in surface TF expression between\n2 groups and the baseline values. Observed differences in the\ndynamics of TF surface expression on monocytes forced us to\nre-evaluate our flow cytometry data and challenge the frequency\nof TF-containing microparticles. TF-containing microparticles\nwere determined by gating all events, which were smaller in size\nthan platelets, using forward scatter against TF-Alexa488 chan-\nnel plot. Indeed, we found nearly a 2-fold LPS-induced increase\nin the frequency of TF  events in samples from HRs and only a\nminor increase in LRs (Figure 3D).\nWe found no baseline difference in the surface expression\nof TF on nonstimulated CD14  cells from LRs (1.40.1%)\nand HRs (1.50.2%; Figure 3A and 3B). MFI did not differ\nbetween groups and was 4.50.3 AU and 4.20.1 AU in\nLRs and HRs, respectively (Figure 3C).\nBy use of fluorescence confocal microscopy of isolated\nMNCs in resting and LPS-stimulated conditions, we visual-\nized the distribution of TF antigen between cytoplasmic and\nmembrane compartments. Only a few CD14  cells expressed\nTF in permeabilized and nonpermeabilized conditions (Fig-\nure 4A and 4B). Furthermore, we noticed 2 phenotypes when\nimaging nonpermeabilized resting CD14  cells: 1 did not\nexpress TF on the membrane surface, whereas another did\n(Figure 4C and 4D). The pattern of TF surface distribution could\nbe characterized by the presence of 5 to 7 TF-enriched dots or\n“patches.” When permeabilized, resting CD14  cells have TF-\ncontaining speckles in the proximity of the plasma membrane,\nready to be exocytosed to the cell exterior (Figure 4E).\nAfter 2 hours of LPS stimulation, permeabilized mono-\ncytes had their membranes enriched with TF antigen. The\ncytoplasm was depleted from TF-containing granules except\nfor a strong TF-positive staining unilaterally from the nucleus\n(Figure 4F). This could be newly synthesized TF protein.\nTo verify TF antigen distribution data from flow cytometry\nand fluorescence confocal microscopy, we used a quantitative\nimmunofluorescence staining in-cell Western assay.\nThe relationship between intracellular and membrane lo-\ncated TF antigen in resting and LPS-stimulated MNCs is\ndemonstrated in Figure 5A. Surprisingly, when comparing\nintensities of total TF signal in LPS-stimulated MNCs with\ncells from time-matched nonstimulated samples, we found\nsignificantly higher LPS-induced accumulation of intracellu-\nlar TF antigen in LRs compared with HRs (Figure 5B). At the\nsame time, LPS treatment caused a 4-fold increase of surface\nTF signal intensity in HRs. However, no such increase was\nfound in the surface TF signal of LRs (Figure 5B).\nData from the immunoblotting of MNC lysates against TF\nantigen confirmed that after 2 hours of LPS stimulation,\nMNCs of LRs indeed accumulated TF antigen, whereas in\nHRs,\nthis accumulation was minor (Figure 5C and 5D).\nMNCs from time-matched samples of LRs experienced vir-\ntually no accumulation of the TF antigen in contrast to the\nsignificant accumulation of TF in MNCs of HRs (Figure 5D).\nComparison of real-time PCR data on de novo TF synthesis in\nLPS-stimulated conditions revealed similar mean cycle threshold\nvalues in MNCs of HRs and LRs (Table I, available online at\nhttp://atvb.ahajournals.org). Therefore, LPS stimulation is not only\nnecessary for the induction of TF synthesis, but also for its transport\nvia exocytotic pathway and shedding from the cell membrane.\nIn the present ex vivo study, using a whole blood system, we\nreport several novel observations characterizing the distribu-\ntion of TF antigen between the interior and surface of MNCs\nfrom HRs and LRs. MNCs from representatives of these\ngroups exhibit distinct patterns of intracellular TF accumula-\ntion, externalization onto cell membrane, and shedding of\nTF-containing microparticles in LPS-treated conditions.\nFACS analyses using double staining against CD14 and TF\nrevealed higher LPS-induced surface expression of TF on\nmonocytes of individuals from the HR group compared with\nLRs. Our data imply that in HRs, a higher frequency of\nCD14  cells expose TF on the cell surface after LPS-\nstimulation when compared with LRs.\nData of FACS analyses were in accordance with our\nfindings from fluorescence confocal microscopy, in which we\ndemonstrated redistribution of TF antigen on stimulation with\nLPS onto the cell surface. In stimulated conditions, TF was\ntransported and localized mostly on the membrane because\nthere was a clear depletion of TF staining from the cytoplasm.\nIntense dots present unilaterally from the nucleus could\nrepresent de novo synthesized TF.\nImmunoblotting showed LPS-induced TF antigen accumula-\ntion in the lysates of MNCs from LRs, whereas in MNCs from\nHR individuals, this accumulation was seen in a minor extent.\nAn in-cell Western assay also confirms this finding. Signifi-\ncantly higher total TF antigen accumulation was found in\nLPS-treated MNCs of LRs without exposure of TF antigen to the\ncell membrane. We demonstrate that LPS-stimulated monocytes\nof HRs synthesize, quickly externalize, and release TF antigen,\nwhereas monocytes of LRs retain TF inside and are slower to\nexternalize. HRs and LRs had similar LPS-induced TF synthe-\nsis, as demonstrated by data from relative quantification of TF\nmRNA by real-time PCR. High levels of TF in time-matched\nnonstimulated samples of HRs could be explained by synthesis\nof TF without externalization and “loss” via shedding. Altered\nreactivity of LR monocytes triggered weaker TF synthesis in\ntime-matched nonstimulated cells. Together, it is possible that\nmonocytes from HRs could synthesize equal or even higher\namounts of TF antigen than those from LRs.\nIn both groups, TF was detected in only 1.4% to 1.5% of\ncells of the total CD14  population under resting conditions.\nThe amount of surface TF, localized per individual monocyte,\ndid not differ between groups, as shown by the MFI data.\nAlthough it has been reported that the population of mono-\ncytes expressing TF at the baseline conditions is small,\nour study for the first\ntime characterizes a fraction of\nTF-expressing resting CD14  cells. These data are in accor-\ndance with the recently published results of Butenas et al,\ndemonstrating 0.2% resting MNCs as being TF positive.\nMinor differences in the fraction of TF-positive cells between\ndata of Butenas et al and from our study reflect regular\nvariations related to FACS methodology, and also that we\nhave analyzed cells from the population of CD14  cells,\nwhereas Butenas et al presented values of TF  cells, gated\nfrom the total MNC population.\nImmunostaining against TF and fluorescent confocal mi-\ncroscopy of permeabilized and nonpermeabilized resting\nmonocytes support our data from flow cytometry because\nonly few monocytes expressed TF antigen.

         "Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nThe erm gene product confers clindamycin resistance on Staphylococcus aureus. We report a clindamycin\nclinical failure where resistance developed on therapy in a D-test-positive strain. D tests of 91 clindamycin-\nsusceptible, erythromycin-resistant S. aureus isolates showed that 68% of methicillin-susceptible and 12.3% of\nmethicillin-resistant S. aureus strains were D-test positive.\nClindamycin-susceptible, erythromycin-resistant Staphylo-\ncoccus aureus (clindamycin-erythromycin discordant) may de-\nvelop clindamycin resistance (7, 8). The erm gene product is a\nribosome methylase whose expression is normally minimal.\nErythromycin induces the production of this methylase, which\nis why these strains are erythromycin resistant, but mutations\nin the promoter region of erm allow production of methylase\nwithout an inducer (18, 19). These mutants are stably erythro-\nmycin and clindamycin resistant. Since erythromycin resistance\ncan occur with other mechanisms (e.g., efﬂux pumps and en-\nzymatic modiﬁcation) (15), the D-test identiﬁes inducible re-\nsistance that might presage mutational clindamycin constitu-\ntive resistance. The D-test is performed by placing clindamycin\nand erythromycin disks at an edge-to-edge distance of 15 to 20\nmm and looking for ﬂattening of the clindamycin zone nearest\nthe erythromycin disk (2). A positive D-test suggests the pres-\nence of an erm gene that could result in constitutive clindamy-\ncin resistance and clinical failure.\nThere are few published clinical failures of clindamycin with\nemergence of resistance (1, 3, 9, 12, 16). However, there are\nalso reports of successful use of clindamycin in treating pa-\ntients with D-test-positive isolates (3, 9). We report a clinical\nfailure with documented emergence of resistance. In order to\navoid poor clinical outcomes but retain the usefulness of clin-\ndamycin, it would be helpful to know the prevalence of induc-\nible resistance in clindamycin-erythromycin discordant bacte-\nria. This prevalence varies by geographic location, patient age,\nbacterial species, and bacterial susceptibility proﬁle (4, 5, 10,\n11, 13, 14, 16). For example, a pediatric population in Houston,\nTex., with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) had a D-test\npositivity rate of 2.2% (9) compared to a similar population of\nchildren with MRSA in Chicago, Ill., whose D-test positivity\nrate was 94% (3). We determined the prevalence of D-test\npositivity in clindamycin-erythromycin discordant S. aureus iso-\nlates in our institution in early 2004. We tested isolates from\ninfected body sites where clindamycin might be considered for\ntherapy.\nThe patient was a 44-year-old man with fever, chills, and\nincreased low back pain 10 days after a lumbar discectomy. At\nadmission he had a temperature of 102.4°F and complained of\n3 days of erythema, bloody drainage, and pain along his inci-\nsion. He had a wound exploration, and the tissue Gram stain\nshowed white blood cells and gram-positive cocci. Fluid and\nblood cultures grew clindamycin-erythromycin discordant me-\nthicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), which was treated with\n2 weeks of oxacillin followed by 2 weeks of oral clindamycin.\nTen days after completing clindamycin therapy, he had severe\nback pain, chills, a temperature of 101.6°F, and purulent drain-\nage from his wound. A magnetic resonance image showed new\nevidence of lumbar osteomyelitis, discitis, and enhancement of\nparavertebral musculature with a small ﬂuid collection. On\nvancomycin, he had surgical debridement. Bone, blood, and\nwound cultures all grew MSSA with the same antibiogram as\nthat of his prior isolate except for new clindamycin resistance.\nHe successfully completed therapy with intravenous (oxacillin)\nand oral (combinations of minocycline, trimethoprim-sulfame-\nthoxazole, and rifampin) antibiotics for a total of 5 months.\nThe D-test on the original ﬂuid isolate was positive (Fig. 1);\nhowever, this result was not available at the time of his original\ntherapy. The original S. aureus wound isolate and the blood\nand bone isolates collected after completion of primary ther-\napy were indistinguishable by ribotyping with EcoRI restriction\nenzyme (Christiana Care Health Services, Wilmington, Del.).\nWe collected all 168 S. aureus isolates from wounds, ab-\nscesses, bone, cerebrospinal ﬂuid, pleural ﬂuid, ascitic ﬂuid,\nand joint ﬂuid from 1 January to 28 February 2004 at Temple\nUniversity Hospital (Philadelphia, Pa.). The strains (adult, pe-\ndiatric, inpatient, and outpatient) were stored in glycerol at\n74°C until batch testing in April 2004. Antibiotic susceptibil-\nities were determined by the Vitek-1 test (bioMerieux, Hazel-\nwood, Mo.); erythromycin-intermediate strains were considered\nresistant. The D-test was performed on clindamycin-erythromycin\ndiscordant strains by preparing an 0.5 McFarland suspension of\nbacteria in tryptic soy broth (2) inoculated on Mueller-Hinton\nplates incubated at 35°C for 18 to 24 h wi",

         "I. I\nHE Slepian-Wolf theorem [1] states that separate encod-\ning of the outputs of two correlated sources can be as\nefﬁcient as joint encoding, assuming that the two compressed\nsignals can be jointly decoded. The achievable rate region for\nsuch a system is given by: R  ≥ H(X|Y ), R  ≥ H(Y |X)\nand R  + R  ≥ H(X, Y ).\nAlthough this theoretical result has been known for about\nthree decades, it is only recently that practical coding ap-\nproaches have been proposed. In [2], a ﬁrst coding technique\nusing channel coding principles was introduced. Practical\ndesigns mainly based on Turbo and LDPC codes have since\nbeen presented in several other papers (see [3], [4], [5] for\nexample). Most of these approaches focus on the asymmetric\nscenario, where one of the two sources is transmitted perfectly\nto the receiver.\nFor practical applications, it might be necessary to have\nmore ﬂexibility in the repartition of the bit-rates between\nthe encoders. In [6], Pradhan and Ramchandran proposed\na technique based on their original work (DISCUS [2]) in\norder to achieve any point of the Slepian-Wolf achievable rate\nregion. Their method creates two sub-codes of a single channel\ncode by splitting the original generator matrix in two. Each\nencoder uses then one of these sub-codes to encode its data.\nIn this letter, we propose a constructive approach that allows\nfor a ﬂexible repartition of the transmission rates between\nthe encoders. Our technique uses a single linear channel code\nthat can be non-systematic. The performance of our approach\ndepends only on the quality of the channel code used. Actually,\nthe two correlated sources can be seen respectively as the\ninput and the output of a certain channel used to model their\ncorrelation. We refer to this virtual channel as the correlation\nchannel of the two sources. If we can ﬁnd a code that achieve\nthe capacity of this correlation channel, then our distributed\nsource coding approach can reach the Slepian-Wolf bound and\nis therefore optimal.\nNotice that similar approaches have recently been proposed\nin [7], [8] and [9]. Although our own approach is relatively\nsimilar in spirit to the one in [7], our scheme can also be\nused with non-systematic codes, whereas their technique can\nonly be used with systematic codes. Note that good capacity\nachieving LDPC codes are usually non-systematic. In [8]\nand [9], iterative decoding procedures are proposed in order\nto decode the two correlated blocks simultaneously. Their\nmain strategy is to apply the standard sum-product algorithm\n(message-passing decoding [10]) on an extended factor graph,\ncorresponding to two standard LDPC decoders connected\nthrough correlation nodes modeling the joint distribution be-\ntween the sources. In Section III, we show that our approach\ndoes not require the use of such extended graphs since our\nmethods only needs to decode one single block (the difference\npattern). A standard iterative decoding scheme similar to the\none proposed in [5] can therefore be used in our case. Our\napproach can thus be seen as an intuitive extension of the\nasymmetric approach proposed in [5] in order to achieve the\nentire Slepian-Wolf achievable rate region.\nII. A S      E                H       (7, 4) C\nWe consider the Hamming (7, 4) code C whose parity check\nmatrix is given by:\n⎛\nH =\n⎝\n⎞\n⎠ .\n(1)\nWe know that a codeword x belongs to the Hamming code C\nif and only if its syndrome is equal to zero:\ns  = Hx  = 0 ⇐⇒ x ∈ C.\n(2)\nThe minimum distance between any two of the 16 codewords\nof the Hamming code is three. This code is therefore able to\ncorrect up to one bit error per codeword. Assume e  is the\nerror pattern corresponding to an error at bit position i (e  has\nsix 0s and one 1 at position i). We deﬁne y = x ⊕ e  where\n⊕ corresponds to the binary addition. This codeword y does\nclearly not belong to C since its distance from x is equal to\none. Its syndrome is given by:\ns  = Hy  = H(x ⊕ e )  = Hx  ⊕ He\n= He\n.\n(3)\nthe syndrome of an erroneous\nWe can therefore see that\ncodeword does not depend on the original codeword but only\non the error pattern. This means that if we change the i   bit\nof all the codewords of C, this produces 16 new codewords, all\nhaving syndrome He\n. This new set of codewords is called\ncoset number i and has the same properties as C (coset 0),\nthat is, the minimum distance between any two codewords is\nstill three. All the 2  possible 7-bit blocks are thus distributed\nin 8 distinct cosets. Notice that this Hamming (7, 4) code has\na particular structure such that the syndrome of an erroneous\ncodeword gives the binary representation of the error position,\nor similarly, the coset number.\nConsider now two discrete memoryless uniformly dis-\ntributed 7-bit binary random variables x and y, correlated such\nthat their Hamming distance is at most one (d  (x, y) ≤ 1).\nAssume that x and y belong to cosets i and j respectively.\nThe difference between x and y is given by the error pattern\ne  = x ⊕ y (x and y differs at position k).

         "The Journal of Immunology\nCbl proteins have been implicated in ligand-induced TCR/CD3 down-modulation, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. We\nanalyzed the effect of mutation of a cbl-binding site on ZAP-70 (ZAP-Y292F) on dynamics, internalization, and degradation of the\nTCR/CD3 complex in response to distinct stimuli. Naive CD8 T cells expressing the P14 transgenic TCR from ZAP-Y292F mice\nwere selectively affected in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to antigenic stimulation, whereas neither anti-CD3 Ab-, and\nPMA-induced TCR down-modulation, nor constitutive receptor endocytosis/cycling were impaired. We further established that\nthe defect in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to Ag was paralleled by an impaired TCR/CD3 internalization and CD3\ndegradation. Analysis of T/APC conjugates revealed that delayed redistribution of TCR at the T/APC contact zone was paralleled\nby a delay in TCR internalization in the synaptic zone in ZAP-Y292F compared with ZAP-wild-type T cells. Cbl recruitment to\nthe synapse was also retarded in ZAP-Y292F T cells, although F-actin and LFA-1 redistribution was similar for both cell types.\nThis study identiﬁes a step involving ZAP-70/cbl interaction that is critical for rapid internalization of the TCR/CD3 complex at\nthe CD8 T cell/APC synapse. The Journal of Immunology, 2005, 175: 3140 –3149.\nhe Ag-speciﬁc TCR, TCR is expressed at the cell sur-\nface when associated with the CD3 complex composed of\nthe CD3/CD3, CD3/CD3, and CD3- dimers. Its\nlevel of surface expression is ﬁnely tuned by mechanisms control-\nling its assembly, membrane dynamics, and degradation, which\nvary along T cell development and as a consequence of T cell\nactivation. In particular, T cell stimulation by APC presenting the\ncognate peptide/MHC complex leads to a rapid decrease in the\nlevel of surface-expressed TCR. This phenomenon, known as\nTCR/CD3 down-modulation, occurs mainly by internalization of\nthe whole receptor complex through endosomal pathways (1, 2),\nalthough mechanisms invoking exocytosis of vesicles containing\nthe receptor have also been described (3).\nAg-induced TCR down-modulation is intimately linked to TCR\nsignaling and, in particular, to protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)  ac-\ntivation, including Src family PTKs p56    and p59   . These ki-\nnases phosphorylate tyrosines in the ITAM motifs of CD3 cyto-\nplasmic domains, allowing for binding of the ZAP-70 PTK via its\nSH2 domains. Subsequent phosphorylation of adaptor molecules\nand protein-protein interactions further transduce positive and neg-\native signals for functional activation of the T cells (4). In this\ncontext, TCR/CD3 down-modulation has been suggested to be one\nof the mechanisms that contribute to the arrest of signaling initi-\nated by Ag. Alternatively, it could be reasoned that the failure to\ndisengage peptide/MHC complexes by receptor clearance would\nprevent the serial engagement of new receptors that is required for\noptimal T cell stimulation by the limiting amount of peptide/MHC\ncomplexes available on the APCs (4, 5).\nApproaches at unraveling the complexities of TCR dynamics\nand signaling have included the analysis of T cells expressing\nTCR/CD3 complexes modiﬁed at potential internalization motifs,\nor in components of the receptor endocytosis/degradation pathway.\nIn particular, each CD3 cytoplasmic domain contains tyrosine-\nbased motifs in their ITAMs that are able to bind to the \nchain\nof the clathrin adaptor AP2 (6). Furthermore, the CD3 and CD3\nchains each present a di-leucine motif (7) capable of binding the \nsubunit of the AP2 complex (8). The CD3 chain di-leucine motif\nappears necessary for TCR/CD3 constitutive cycling (9), whereas\nthe proximal serine-126 on CD3is additionally required for phor-\nbol ester-induced TCR/CD3 internalization (10), a protein kinase\nC (PKC)-dependent event\ninvolves receptor sequestration\nwithout subsequent degradation (11). For mAb-induced TCR/CD3\ndown-regulation, a process dependent upon tyrosine kinase activ-\nity (12–14), but not PKC, absence of both CD3 and CD3 cyto-\nplasmic domains led to deﬁcient receptor down-modulation, sug-\ngesting that upon T cell activation, unveiling of the di-leucine and\ntyrosine-based motifs present in each of these chains may be in-\nvolved (1). However, Ag-induced TCR down-modulation was not\naffected by the combined truncations of CD3 and CD3 cyto-\nplasmic domains (15), suggesting that a distinct mechanism in-\nvolving ZAP-70 activity (14), was rate limiting in this process.\nthat\nThe Journal of Immunology\nThe particularity of Ag-induced TCR down-modulation is that it\noccurs upon engagement of the TCR by peptide/MHC complexes\nwithin the immune synapse (IS) formed at the T cell/APC contact\nzone. This specialized structure, associated with a redistribution of\nmembrane receptors, develops over a 5–30 min period. It subdi-\nvides the T cell/APC interface into supramolecular activation clus-\nters (SMACs) that are spatially organized into a central (c-SMAC)\nregion where TCR-MHC/peptide and CD28-CD80 interactions\ntake place, and a peripheral (p-SMAC) area enriched in cytoskel-\netal components and adhesion molecules such as LFA-1 (16, 17),\nand CD2 (18). However, the rapid induction of PTK activation\nupon Ag-induced T cell stimulation precedes the redistribution of\nthe TCR/CD3 complex in the c-SMAC (19 –21). The observation\nthat surface TCR disappeared from the c-SMAC may signify its\nlocalized internalization (21).\nTyrosine-292 in ZAP-70, when phosphorylated upon TCR ac-\ntivation, is a binding site for c-cbl and cbl-b via the cbl tyrosine\nkinase binding domain (22–24). Contrasting results were reported\nfor thymocytes of mice expressing an altered c-cbl mutated in its\ntyrosine kinase binding domain, because this led to constitutive\nactivation of rac without affecting ZAP-70 phosphorylation (25).\nHowever, the effect of this mutation could not be studied in pe-\nripheral T cells, where mostly cbl-b is expressed.\nAdaptor proteins of the Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa\n(CIN85) family have recently been shown to bind both cbl and\nendophilins, and thereby to regulate the endocytosis of activated\nreceptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) (26 –29). Cbl is also involved in\nRTK monoubiquitination allowing for receptor binding to the\nclathrin adaptor Eps15 (28, 30, 31). In T cells, the CIN85 family\nmember CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) has recently been im-\nplicated in the pathway of TCR/CD3 down-modulation (32, 33).\nFurthermore, we have recently described that T cells from mice\nexpressing ZAP-Y292F presented hyper-tyrosine-phosphorylation\nin response to TCR/CD3 engagement but were partially inhibited\nin Ag-induced TCR down-modulation (34).\nIn the present work, we analyzed the mechanisms by which\nTCR down-modulation is impaired in CD8 T cells expressing the\nZAP-Y292F mutation. Our results showed that the defect in TCR\ndown-modulation was speciﬁc for Ag-induced TCR internalization\nand was associated with a delayed recruitment of TCR and cbl at\nthe T/APC synapse zone.\nMice\nAg-presenting cells\nT cell preparation\nAbs and reagents for immunoﬂuorescence\nFluorescence analysis\nMeasurement of internalized TCR\nConfocal analysis\nROLE FOR ZAP/cbl INTERACTION IN Ag-INDUCED TCR INTERNALIZATION\nAg-induced TCR down-modulation is defective in ZAP-Y292F\ncompared with ZAP-wild-type (WT) CD8 T cells\nOur previous results indicated that TCR down-modulation in re-\nsponse to antigenic stimulation was partially inhibited in CD8 T\ncells from mice expressing ZAP-Y292F molecules (34). We ﬁrst\nconﬁrmed this ﬁnding in a kinetic experiment shown in Fig. 1. As\nseen in Fig. 1A, exposure of ZAP-WT CD8 T cells to APC loaded\nwith the gp33 LCMV peptide at 10   M decreased the level of\nsurface TCR from 830 to 400 MFI units after 60 min, and to MFI\n113 after 270 min. A similar treatment of the ZAP-Y292F CD8 T\ncells decreased the level of surface TCR from 870 to 590 after 60\nmin, and to 330 after 270 min. The rate of TCR down-modulation\nin response to gp33 10   M/APC by the ZAP-Y292F CD8 T cells\nwas about half (20%/h) that observed for the ZAP-WT CD8 T cells\n(38%/h) (Fig. 1B). The large SDs of the 60-min time points cor-\nrespond to the variability of TCR down-modulation observed from\none experiment to the other at that early time, but the respective\nrelative values for mutant to WT T cells were very reproducible in\nthe different experiments (decreased rate of TCR down-modulation\n52  11%). The loading of the RMA-S used as APC was per-\nformed with gp33 concentrations between 10   and 10   M, and\nwe observed a linear dose effect on TCR down-modulation and\nactivation, with a differential rate of TCR down-modulation be-\ntween ZAP-WT and ZAP-Y292F T cells maintained at all con-\ncentrations tested (results not shown).\nWe next analyzed the effect of this mutation on other means of\ninducing TCR down-modulation, such as anti-CD3 mAb or PMA\nstimulations (15, 47). The rate of TCR down-modulation induced\nby anti-CD3 mAb was the same for the ZAP-WT and ZAP-Y292F\nT cells, i.e., 55%/h (Fig. 1B). Receptor down-modulation was\nalso similar for the two types of T cells at any dose of anti-CD3\nmAb used, whether soluble (Fig. 1C) or plastic-coated (results not\nshown). When cells were stimulated by PMA, we also observed a\nsimilar rate of TCR down-modulation for both strains (results not\nshown) (see Fig. 2B).\nAll experiments were controlled for T cell activation by mea-\nsuring the induction of CD69, and we conﬁrmed that there was no\ndifference between the two strains in tha",

Here, we describe the identiﬁcation and characteriza-\ntion of a new member of the NLRR family, NLRR4, and its potential role in long-lasting memory. We generated\nNLRR4-deﬁcient (NLRR4   ) mice and found that they showed impaired memory retention. In hippocampus-\ndependent learning tasks, NLRR4    mice were able to learn and maintain the memories for one day but\nunable to retain the memories for four days after learning. In contrast, in a hippocampus-independent task,\nNLRR4    mice were able to retain the memory normally for at least seven days. These results suggest that\nNLRR4 plays a key role in hippocampus-dependent long-lasting memory.\nThe hippocampus plays a role in declarative memory such as\nepisodic and spatial memories, but unimodal memories such as\ncued fear memories occur independently of the hippocampus.\nHippocampal lesions result in severe amnesia of contextual\nand spatial learning and memory but do not affect normal\nlearning, as seen by the cued fear-conditioning test (3, 19, 24).\nMemory formation can be divided into three phases by differ-\nences in the length of the time from acquisition; short-term\nmemory, long-term memory, and long-lasting memory (22).\nNew protein synthesis is not required for short-term memory\nbut is required for long-term memory (18, 21).\nThe hippocampus plays a role in the acquisition of short-\nterm memory and also for the conversion of short-term mem-\nory to long-term memory within several hours after acquisition,\na process known as cellular memory consolidation (22). Long-\nterm memory is converted to long-lasting memory that is per-\nmanently stored in the cortex (7, 8). This process is known as\nsystem consolidation, and the memory acquired in the past is\nkept intact even if the hippocampus is damaged. Some proteins\nimplicated in cellular memory consolidation have been re-\nported, such as N-methyl- -aspartate receptor, calcium-calm-\nodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), and cyclic\nAMP (cAMP)-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) in\nmice (5, 16, 18, 26). Cellular consolidation requires new pro-\ntein synthesis directed by CREB-mediated transcription.\n-Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)\nis the only molecule known to be involved in system consoli-\ndation, and CaMKII heterozygous mice are defective in long-\nlasting memory and cortical long-term potentiation (7). How-\never, how CaMKII is involved in this process is not fully\nunderstood.\nIn this study, we describe a novel type I transmembrane\nprotein termed NLRR4 which exhibits similarity to neuronal\nleucine-rich repeat proteins NLRR1 to NLRR3. NLRR1 and\nNLRR2 are expressed in the developing nervous system (4, 14,\n28, 29). NLRR3 is induced by brain injury and regulated by\nRas-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (9, 10, 15).\nHowever, their functions remain to be studied. To uncover the\nfunction of NLRR4 in vivo, we generated NLRR4-deﬁcient\n(NLRR4   ) mice by replacing its exons with the -galactosi-\ndase gene by homologous\nrecombination. Homozygous\nNLRR4    mice were viable and fertile. We found that their\nlong-term memory in hippocampus-dependent tasks was se-\nlong-term potentiation\nverely impaired, while hippocampal\nwas intact. Interestingly, hippocampus-independent memory\nassessed by the cued fear conditioning in NLRR4    mice was\nnormal. These data indicate that NLRR4 is important for\nmaintenance of hippocampus-dependent memories.\nRESULTS\nMolecular cloning of the NLRR4 gene. In our studies on the\ndevelopment of hematopoiesis, we generated a number of\nmonoclonal antibodies against LO cells (12), a hemangioblast-\nlike cell line. B61 is one such antibody and recognizes a cell\nsurface molecule on LO cells. We employed an expression\ncloning strategy to identify the B61 antigen by using COS7 cells\nand an expression library of LO cells, and we obtained a 2.7-kb\ncDNA encoding the B61 antigen. While the B61 antigen was\nhighly expressed in the hemangioblast-like cell line LO, B61\nmRNA was not found in hematopoietic tissues (data not\nshown). Instead, we found its expression in neuronal tissues as\ndescribed below.

         "ort-term and the early phase of long-term plas-\nticity at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in the hippocampus.\nDISCUSSION\nWe isolated a cDNA encoding a new member of the NLRR\nfamily, a type I transmembrane protein with leucine-rich re-\npeats and a ﬁbronectin type III repeat. Leucine-rich repeats\nconsist of multiple copies of the conserved sequence. Proteins\nwith leucine-rich repeats mediate homophilic or heterophilic\nprotein-protein interactions. Slits function as a ligand for the\nRobo receptors through its leucine-rich repeat (2, 11), and\nNgR and Trks are receptors for Nogo and neurotrophic factors\n(6, 17), respectively. CAPS and connectin function as cell rec-\nognition molecules in neuromuscular development via their\nhomophilic interaction (23, 27). We therefore tested a ho-\nmophilic interaction of NLRR4 protein. However, cell aggre-\ngation assays using NLRR4-expressing cells failed to show any\ninteraction (data not shown), suggesting that NLRR4 may be\ninvolved in cell-cell interactions as a component or it may be a\nreceptor or a ligand for an unknown molecule.\nNLRR4-deﬁcient mice generated by inserting the -galac-\ntosidase cDNA into the NLRR4 gene locus developed nor-\nmally and exhibited no anatomical abnormalities. The NLRR4\nexpression revealed by -galactosidase activity indicates that\nNLRR4 is expressed in the hippocampus, layers V and VI in\nthe cortex and piriform cortex, the internal granule layer, and\nPurkinje cell in the cerebellum. The hippocampus plays a role\nin the initial storage and the cellular consolidation of spatial\ninformation (22, 26). Since NLRR4 is highly expressed in the\nhippocampus, it is possible that NLRR4 is involved in learning\nand/or memory. In fact, we found that\nthe memory of\nNLRR4    mice was severely impaired for two learning tests\nthat are dependent on the hippocampus; the contextual fear-\nconditioning and hidden-platform Morris water maze tests.\nIn the contextual fear-conditioning test, NLRR4    mice\nwere able to learn normally as shown by the normal freezing\nbehavior 1 day after training. However, NLRR4    mice failed\nto retain the memory longer as their freezing behavior was\nsigniﬁcantly reduced 4 and 7 days after training. We obtained\nsimilar results in the hidden-platform Morris water maze\ntest. Thus,\nin the hippocampus-dependent behavioral tests\nNLRR4    mice are able to learn and retain memories nor-\nmally memory 1 day after training. Consistently, NLRR4\nmice showed normal long-term potentiation in the hippocam-\npus, indicating that initial memory and cellular consolidation\nare normal in NLRR4    mice. Contextual and spatial mem-\nories are known to be retained in the hippocampus for several\ndays and long-lasting memory is permanently stored in the\ncortex (7, 8). As memory retention 4 days after training was\nseverely impaired in NLRR4    mutant mice, it is likely that\nNLRR4 is required for long-lasting memory.\nIn contrast to hippocampus-dependent memories, NLRR4\nmice showed normal cued fear memory in which a tone was\npaired with an electric foot shock. This task depends on the\namygdala but is independent of the hippocampus. It is known\nthat hippocampus lesion results in impaired spatial memory\nbut normal memory in the cued fear-conditioning tests (19).\nLikewise, the hippocampal CA1 region-speciﬁc knockout of\nthe NR1 gene encoding an essential subunit of the N-methyl-\n-aspartate receptor results in amnesia of contextual fear\nmemory without affecting cued fear memory (26). Axon of\nCA1 pyramidal cells mainly extend to the layer V in entorhinal\ncortex and NLRR4 is expressed in CA1, CA3, and dentate\ngyrus in the hippocampus and in layers V and VI in the cortex.\nThese results collectively suggest that the impaired retention of\nmemories in NLRR4    mice depends on the hippocampal\nfunction but is independent of the amygdala.\nAmnesia in NLRR4    mice is similar to that in CaMKII\nheterozygous mice, which exhibit severely impaired hippocam-\npus-dependent\nlong-lasting memory, while the molecular\nmechanism how CaMKII is involved in long-lasting memory\nstill remains to be elucidated, there may be a link between\nNLRR and CaMKII. CREB is required for the cellular con-\nsolidation of long-term memory, indicating that a protein(s)\nregulated by CREB plays a role in long-term memory (1, 5,\n18). Therefore, the impaired memory in NLRR4    mice\nmight be due to an alteration in this pathway. As NLRR4 is a\ntransmembrane protein with protein-protein interaction mo-\ntifs, it is tempting to speculate that NLRR4 may generate an\nintracellular signal that affects the CREB pathway in the hip-\npocampus. It will be of interest to ﬁnd a molecule that interacts\nwith NLRR4.",

Examples\nof semantic video analysis based on a priori information are\ntemplate matching, extraction of captions and text, face de-\ntection, and moving object segmentation. Template matching\nis used to implement the semantics when the shape objects\nwe want to segment is known a priori. In this case, which\nincludes in particular the detection of captions and text, the\nextraction method searches for speciﬁc object features in terms\nof geometry. For segmenting faces of people, color-based\nsegmentation can be used [16]. The face detection task consists\nin ﬁnding the pixels whose spectral characteristics lie in a\nspeciﬁc region in the chromaticity diagram. For extracting\nmoving objects, motion information can be used as semantics.\nSeveral applications, such as sport broadcasting and video\nsurveillance, deal with segmenting moving objects.\nA typical tool used to tackle the problem of object segmen-\ntation based on motion is change detection. Different change\ndetection techniques can be employed for moving camera\nand static camera conditions. If the camera moves, change\ndetection aims at recognizing coherent and incoherent moving\nareas. The former correspond to background areas, the latter\nto video objects. If the camera is static, the goal of change\ndetection is to recognize moving objects (foreground) and the\nstatic background. The semantic analysis we use addresses\nthe static camera problem and is applicable in the case of a\nmoving camera after global motion compensation. The change\ndetector decides whether in each pixel position the foreground\nsignal corresponding to an object is present. This decision\nis taken by thresholding the frame difference between the\ncurrent frame and a frame representing the background. The\nframe representing the background is dynamically generated\nbased on temporal information [17]. The thresholding aims\nat discarding the effect of the camera noise after frame\ndifferencing. A locally adaptive threshold, τ (i, j), is used that\nmodels the noise statistics and applies a signiﬁcance test. To\nthis end, we want to determine the probability that frame\ndifference at a given position (i, j) is due to noise, and not to\nother causes. Let us suppose that there is no moving object in\nthe frame difference. We refer to this hypothesis as the null\nhypothesis, H . Let g(i, j) be the sum of the absolute values\nof the frame difference in an observation window of q pixels\naround (i, j). Moreover, let us assume that the camera noise is\nadditive and follows a Gaussian distribution with variance σ.\nGiven H , the conditional pdf of the frame difference follows\na χ\ndistribution with q degrees of freedom deﬁned by\nf\nH\ng(i, j)\n|\n=\n2   σ Γ(q/2)\ng(i, j)       e\n,\n(1)\nwhere Γ(\n) is the Gamma function, that can be evaluated as\n·\nΓ(x+ 1) = xΓ(x), and Γ(1/2) = √π.

Forty\npercent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. In particular, 2% were penicillin\nresistant and 20% had intermediate penicillin resistance. Multidrug resistance to macrolides, lincosamides,\nand tetracycline was the most frequent antibiotype (17% of all isolates). Serotyping and molecular typing by\npulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis were performed for 202 out of 237 drug-resistant pneumococci (DRPn). The\nmost frequent serotypes were 6B (26%), 14 (22%), 19F (16%), 23F (10%), and nontypeable (12%). The majority\n(67%) of the DRPn strains were representatives of nine international clones included in the Pneumococcal\nMolecular Epidemiology Network; eight of them had been detected in previous studies. Fourteen novel clones\nwere identiﬁed, corresponding to 26% of the DRPn strains. The remaining 7% of the strains were local clones\ndetected in our previous studies. Comparison with studies conducted since 1996 in Portuguese DCCs identiﬁed\nseveral trends: (i) the rate of DRPn frequency has ﬂuctuated between 40 and 50%; (ii) the serotypes most\nfrequently recovered have remained the same; (iii) nontypeable strains appear to be increasing in frequency;\nand (iv) a clone of serotype 33F emerged in 1999. Together, our observations highlight that the nasopharynxes\nof children in DCCs are a melting pot of successful DRPn clones that are important to study and monitor if\nwe aim to gain a better understanding on the epidemiology of this pathogen.\nThe ecological niche of Streptococcus pneumoniae is the na-\nsopharynxes of humans. Although pneumococci are widely\nspread in the community, carriage rates are particularly high in\npreschool children attending day care centers (DCCs) (24, 45).\nS. pneumoniae can cause a spectrum of diseases including\ninvasive disease, such as meningitis, bloodstream infections,\nand pneumonia, as well as infections of the upper respiratory\ntract. S. pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mor-\ntality in young children (6). In the last decade an increasing\nproportion of pneumococci that are not susceptible to penicil-\nlin has been observed, reaching up to 50% in some areas of the\nworld (1, 10, 16, 37, 39, 43).\nIn 1996 our group began yearly surveillance of the nasopha-\nryngeal carriage of pneumococci and other bacterial respira-\ntory tract pathogens in DCCs located in the Lisbon area of\nPortugal. Since 1996, a total of 23 DCCs and over 1,800 chil-\ndren participated in this study. Serotypes, antibiotypes, and\nmolecular types of the majority of drug-resistant S. pneu-\nmoniae isolates were determined during these annual surveil-\nlances (8, 9, 34, 35), allowing one to obtain a view of temporal\nchanges of drug-resistant pneumococci (DRPn) inhabiting the\nnasopharyngeal ﬂora, an important ecological reservoir which\nmay be a major source of drug-resistant strains causing pedi-\natric and adult disease. The importance of such surveillances\nfor both the national and international communities has been\nhighlighted in recent reports (15, 32, 38).\nIn the study described here we provide new data on the\nnasopharyngeal carriage of drug-resistant pneumococci during\nthe 1999 surveillance. We also summarize temporal changes\nnoted in the same surveillance system between 1996 and 1999.\nRESULTS\nStudy population.

         "lso of type 33F\n(Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study was a follow-up of the Lisbon Day Care Center\nInitiative which started in 1996 and was conducted on a yearly\nbasis (8, 9, 34, 35). The main purpose of the initiative was to\nmonitor the prevalence of drug-resistant pneumococcal strains\namong children attending DCCs and to characterize the strains\nby serotyping and molecular typing techniques. No such stud-\nies had ever been conducted in Portugal and, to our best\nknowledge, this remains the only surveillance program of this\ntype in the country. In addition, although other studies on the\npneumococci carried by DCC attendees have been conducted\nin other countries (3, 4, 19, 29), we are not aware of efforts that\nhave lasted for several years and are of such large magnitude,\nwhere all DRPn (including strains susceptible to penicillin)\nhave been extensively characterized by serotyping and geno-\ntyping (and antibiotyping), with the possible exception of a\nstudy described by Nilsson and Laurell (29) in Malmo, Sweden,\nwhich included close to 3,000 children attending 63 DCCs\nduring a 3-year period (1995 to 1997). In that study, molecular\ntyping was done by AP-PCR and BOX-A PCR. Other DCC\nstudies carried out in Greece (4), The Netherlands (3), and\nIsrael (19) have been described. These studies had smaller\nnumbers of children and of pneumococcal isolates. In addition,\nthese studies were point-prevalence ones and did not include\nyearly surveillances like ours, and they also had different de-\nsigns. In particular, the Israeli study was a 5-month longitudi-\nnal study of 252 children; the authors used ribotyping to char-\nacterize the 594 pneumococci (19). Two Greek studies were\nperformed since December of 1995. The ﬁrst one was per-\nformed with 338 children attending seven day care centers. The\nstudy was conducted from December of 1995 to February of\n1996. The second study, was conducted from February of 1997\nto February of 1999, but only 95 of the 2,448 children sampled\nattended day care centers; the authors used RFEL and MLST\nto characterize 128 isolates susceptible to penicillin but resis-\ntant to other antimicrobials (4). A study from The Netherlands\ncompared 259 children attending 16 DCCs with 276 children\nwho did not attend DCCs. Children were sampled twice from\nJanuary to March of 1999, and a total of 305 pneumococci were\nrecovered (3).\nIn fact, in the 4 years of the study, 23 DCCs and 1,800\nchildren were enrolled, generating 3,053 nasopharyngeal sam-\nples of which 1,687 were positive for pneumococci. All pneu-\nmococcal isolates were characterized by antibiotype. Of the\n740 DRPn recovered, 615 pneumococci strains were com-\npletely characterized by serotyping and PFGE typing (8, 35).\nThese data have been a rich source of information on the\npneumococcal population and have enabled us to observe\ntrends of the DRPn in its ecological niche. In addition, these\nstudies have provided a good baseline for two intervention\nstudies that began in 2001 aimed to decrease carriage of\nDRPn: one based on education on antibiotic use and hygiene\ncontrol measures (the EURIS project, European Resistance\nIntervention Study) and the other based on the licensed 7-va-\nlent conjugate vaccine Prevenar (in preparation). The EURIS\nproject is now being continued in a sequel named PREVIS\n(Pneumococcal Resistance, Epidemicity, and Virulence—an\nInternational Study) and, by 2006, we will have completed a\ndecade of annual-biannual surveillance of pneumococci car-\nried by DCC attendees.\nThe data from the 1999 surveillance described here indicate\nthat the carriage rate of S. pneumoniae in Portuguese DCCs\nhas increased continuously since 1996, from 47% to 48, 60, and\n63% in subsequent years (35). The reasons for this increase are\nnot clear. We can only speculate that the nurses who collected\nthe samples have been mastering their sampling technique,\nyielding higher pneumococcal recovery rates. Similar high\nrates of pneumococcal carriage in DCC children have been\nreported in other countries such as Iceland (50%) (23), Swe-\nden (52%) (22), Lithuania (51%) (23), France (54.7%) (12),\nIsrael (63%) (45), and Greece (48%) (44).\nComparison of the 1999 results with results of the previous\nyears of surveillance indicated that the proportion of DRPn\nranged between 40 to 50% of all isolates. The carriage rate of\npenicillin-resistant and penicillin-intermediate pneumococci\nalso ﬂuctuated—ranging from 2 to 8% and 12 to 27%, respec-\ntively—over time. Interestingly, 1999 was the year with the\nlowest rate of penicillin resistance (2%) (Fig. 3).\nAnalysis of Portuguese invasive strains, recovered between\n1999 and 2001 from pediatric patients of the same age group,\nidentiﬁed higher values of DRPn (63.8%) and of resistance to\npenicillin (4.7%) (38). However, drug resistance to antimicro-\nbials other than penicillin was 15.9% among invasive pediatric\nisolates, a value comparable to the 18% carriage rate of such\nstrains identiﬁed in our study.

Because of compulso-\nry pasteurization of milk products and strict control of the\ndisease  in  dairy  cattle,  the  incidence  of  brucellosis  has\nsteadily  declined  in  most  industrialized  countries  during\nthe last 50 years. However, the disease remains among the\nmost commonly recognized causes of laboratory-transmit-\nted infections; 2% of all brucellosis cases are laboratory-\nacquired (1,3–9).\nThe Organism\nSeveral  biologic  characteristics  make  brucellae  easily\ntransmissible within the close confinement of the clinical\nmicrobiology laboratory, including the facts that the infect-\ning dose for humans is low, and the organism may enter the\nbody in many ways relevant to laboratory practices (e.g.,\nthrough  the  respiratory  mucosa,  conjunctivae,  gastroin-\ntestinal tract, or abraded skin) (1,2). Rare cases of acquisi-\ntion of the organism through organ transplantation, sexual\ncontact,  breastfeeding,  or  the  transplacental  route  have\nalso been reported (1). Because person-to-person transmis-\nsion does not occur, infected persons do not pose a threat\nto their surroundings.\nand\nfusion\nreproducing\nSoon  after  entry  into  the  body  through  the  skin  or\nmucous  membranes,  brucellae  are  ingested  by  polymor-\nphonuclear and mononuclear phagocytes. The organism is\nable to escape phagocytic killing by inhibiting the phago-\nsome-lysosome\ninside\nmacrophages  (1,10).  After  a  variable  incubation  period\nranging  from  <1  week  to  several  months  (usually  2–4\nweeks),  nonspecific  systemic  symptoms  such  as  fever,\nheadache,  malaise,  night  sweats,  and  arthralgia  follow,\nresembling a flulike disease (1,2). During the early stages\nof  the  disease,  patients  are  frequently  bacteremic.  This\nbacteremia  has  a  continuous  pattern,  making  circulating\nbrucellae  easily  detectable  by  blood  culture.  Once  in  the\nbloodstream, the organism is seeded to multiple organ sys-\ntems and especially to those rich in reticuloendothelial tis-\nsue,  such  as  the  liver,  spleen,  and  the  skeletal  and\nhematopoietic systems, where it may cause localized dis-\nease such as hepatitis or arthritis (1,2).\nBecause  of  the  variable  manifestations  of  human  bru-\ncellosis, a wide array of different clinical specimens may\ncontain viable brucellae, including pus, blood, bone mar-\nrow,  synovial  fluid  and  tissues,  and  more  rarely,  cere-\nbrospinal  fluid,  urine,  and  genital  exudates.  The\nconcentration  of Brucella organisms  in  the  blood  (11,12)\nand synovial fluid (13) of patients with brucellosis is usu-\nally low, and therefore, these clinical specimens probably\npose  a  low  risk  for  contagion  for  laboratory  personnel.\nHowever,  the  danger  of  clinically  relevant  exposure\nincreases exponentially after incubation of both solid and\nliquid media. Seeded media harbor considerable amounts\nof  viable Brucella organisms,  and  routine  bacteriologic\nprocedures  such  as  preparing,  centrifuging,  and  vigorous\nagitation (vortexing) of bacterial suspensions, performing\nsubcultures  and  biochemical  testing,  and  particularly  the\ncatalase test, may create dangerous aerosols and the poten-\ntial for accidental spillage (14).\nMost  cases  of  laboratory-acquired  brucellosis  have\nbeen  caused  by  the  more  virulent  Brucella  melitensis\nspecies  (3,4,6,8,14–29).  B.  suis (4,6),  B.  abortus (3,6,8),\nand B. canis (30) have also been implicated, and transmis-\nsion of the attenuated B. abortus 19 and B. melitensis Rev-\n1 vaccine strains has also been reported (31,32).\nClinical Manifestations of\nLaboratory-acquired Infections\nPatients involved in laboratory outbreaks of brucellosis\nhave shown almost the entire range of clinical manifesta-\ntions of the disease, ranging from the common prolonged\nfebrile  syndrome  (undulant  fever)  (14)  and  a  flulike  dis-\nease (25,27), to focal signs and symptoms, such as hepati-\ntis (17,33), lymphadenopathy (17,25), uveitis (14), breast\nabscess  (28)  epididymitis  (29),  arthritis  (17),  discitis\n(29,34), pneumonitis (17), deep vein thrombosis (29), and\nmeningitis  (31).

Overview of the Problem\nThe problem of autonomous navigation has attracted a lot\nof interest for various robotic systems during last decades.\nTwo main paradigms have arisen to tackle this problem, the\ndeliberative approaches resulting in global motion planning\nschemes, i.e. the determination of a complete plan based on a\npriori known information and the reactive approaches taking\ndecision from real-time data by means of exteroceptive sen-\nsors, while moving. Though ﬁrst problems involved mostly\nsimple systems evolving among a stationary environment,\nit became clear that for real applications, dynamic systems\nas well as a dynamic environment had to be considered.\nthe system has\nWithin a dynamic environment however,\nthe obligation to make a decision, within a bounded time,\notherwise it might be in danger by the sole fact of being\npassive. This limited available time for the system to make\na decision, i.e. plan a motion, depends on the nature and\ndynamicity of the environment and is a hard real\ntime\nconstraint. Unfortunately, global motion planning schemes\nbased on techniques from computational geometry that were\nused for the ﬁrst problems [1], did not give much hope to\nfulﬁl such a timing constraint due to their inherent NPHard\ncomplexity [2]. Hence, reactive methods have been preferred\nand several schemes have been presented [3], [4], [5]. Nev-\nertheless, reactive approaches exhibit strong limitations. In\norder to take fast decisions, these methods explore locally\nthe velocity space of the system from which one admissible\ncontrol is selected at a time. As a consequence these methods\nexhibit a lack of lookahead, conducting the robot\nto be\ntrapped in local minima during its trip, and a weak goal\ndirectedness keeping the robot from reaching the objective.\nDespite recent modiﬁcations on a few schemes in order to\nimprove these techniques, once systems with kinematic or\ndynamic constraints are considered, speciﬁc schemes are pro-\nposed [3], [6], [7] but cannot handle such complex systems\nin a general form. Fortunately, in the mid 90’s, probabilistic\nplanners appeared [8] and brought a new powerful\ntool\nfor rapid exploration of high dimensional state-time space,\nframework presented in [9] used for complex systems and\ndynamic environment description. Some recent work could\ndemonstrate fast planning within a dynamic environment\nusing probabilistic techniques [10] and [11].\nHowever, this work does not take into consideration the\nfact that a complete trajectory to the goal might not be\nfound before the available allotted time has elapsed. In fact,\nas [12], we believe that for complex systems or environment,\na complete trajectory to the goal cannot be found over a\nlimited time, in general. In such a case, it becomes of the\nutmost importance to consider the behaviour of the system\nat the end of the trajectory. What if a car ends its trajectory\nin front of a wall at high speed? It becomes clear that strong\nguarantees should be given to this trajectory in order to\nhandle the safety issues raised by such a partial planning.\nA few papers only have addressed the issue of safety\nfor partial or incomplete trajectory by providing, in another\ncontext braking policies [13] or more recently by calculating\nevasive plan [14] or by insuring the system to be collision\nfree during an empirical period of time τ [12]. We believe\nthat these methods propose partial answers to the problem of\nsafety. In Fig. 1 we consider a selected milestone of a point\nmass robot with non zero velocity moving to the right (a state\nof P is therefore characterised by its position (x, y) and its\nspeed v). Depending upon its speed there is a region of states\n(in grey) for which P, even though it is not in collision and\nis τ -safe, will not have the time to brake and avoid collision.\nThese states for which no matter what the future trajectory of\nthe system is, a collision with the obstacle occurs, have been\ncharacterized by [15] as Inevitable Collision States (ICS).\nThe framework of ICS provides a suitable framework to\nestablish the relation of the collision states and the dynamic\nconstraints in order to have strong safety guarantees.\nB. Contribution of the Paper\nIn this paper, we ﬁrst detail the mechanism of a Partial Mo-\ntion Planner (PMP) designed to handle the partial plans that\nwould result from planning under hard real time constraint\nwithin a dynamic environment. Then, we address the safety\nissue related to such a scheme by calculating trajectories\nof safe states using the framework of ICS. We provide a\nsufﬁcient condition for hard safety guarantee for the PMP,\nallowing discrete calculation of the ICS, thus reducing the\ncomputational complexity of the scheme while insuring the\nsafety of the whole trajectory.\nThe paper is organised as follows: §2 brieﬂy reviews\nthe work related to trajectory planning within a dynamic\nenvironment and detail the existing safety guarantees that\nhave been provided in recent approaches. After introducing\nin §3 useful notations and deﬁnitions, we detail in §4 the\nmechanism of the PMP algorithm for which we provide\nand demonstrate in §5 a sufﬁcient hard safety condition. We\npresent ﬁnally in §6 our preliminary results for a car-like\nrobot and draw our",

         "In eukaryotic cellular proteins, protein N-myristoylation has been recog-\nnized as a protein modiﬁcation that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic or\nnucleoplasmic proteins. In this study, to search for a eukaryotic N-myris-\ntoylated transmembrane protein, the susceptibility of the N-terminus of\nseveral G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to protein N-myristoylation\nwas evaluated by in vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling. It was found that\nthe N-terminal 10 residues of B96Bom, a Bombyx mori GPCR, efﬁciently\ndirected the protein N-myristoylation. Analysis of a tumor necrosis factor\n(TNF) fusion protein with the N-terminal 90 residues of B96Bom at its\nN-terminus revealed that (a) transmembrane domain 1 of B96Bom func-\ntioned as a type I signal anchor sequence, (b) the N-myristoylated N-ter-\nminal domain (58 residues) was translocated across the membrane, and (c)\ntwo N-glycosylation motifs located in this domain were efﬁciently N-gly-\ncosylated. In addition, when Ala4 in the N-myristoylation motif of\nB96Bom90-TNF, Met-Gly-Gln-Ala-Ala-Thr(1–6), was replaced with Asn\nto generate a new N-glycosylation motif, Asn-Ala-Thr(4–6), efﬁcient N-gly-\ncosylation was observed on this newly introduced N-glycosylation site in\nthe expressed protein. These results indicate that\nthe N-myristoylated\nN-terminus of B96Bom is translocated across the membrane and exposed\nto the extracellular surface. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report show-\ning that a eukaryotic transmembrane protein can be N-myristoylated and\nthat the N-myristoylated N-terminus of the protein can be translocated\nacross the membrane.\nCovalent attachment of fatty acids to proteins is a\nwell-recognized form of protein modiﬁcation. Two\nforms of protein fatty acylation, protein N-myristoy-\nlation and protein palmitoylation, occur on a wide\nvariety of\neukaryotic and viral proteins. Protein\nN-myristoylation is the attachment of myristic acid, a\n14-carbon saturated fatty acid, to the N-terminal Gly\nof proteins [1–5]. Many of the N-myristoylated pro-\nteins play key roles in regulating cellular structure and\nfunction. They include proteins involved in a wide\nvariety of cellular signal-transduction pathways such\nas protein kinases, phosphatases, guanine nucleotide-\nbinding proteins, and Ca  -binding proteins. In many\ncases, the functions of these N-myristoylated proteins\nare regulated by reversible membrane binding medi-\nated by protein N-myristoylation.\nProtein N-myristoylation has been recognized as a\nprotein modiﬁcation that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic\nand nucleoplasmic proteins, and no eukaryotic trans-\nmembrane protein has been demonstrated to be\nN-myristoylated so far. In viral proteins, however,\nprotein N-myristoylation has been found to occur on\ntransmembrane proteins such as the large L envelope\nprotein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), a polytopic mem-\nbrane protein [6,7]. Therefore, it seemed possible that\nN-myristoylated eukaryotic transmembrane proteins\nexist. In this study, we tried to search for eukaryotic\ntransmembrane proteins\nthat are N-myristoylated.\nAs protein palmitoylation, another type of protein\nacylation,\nis often observed on G-protein-coupled\nreceptors (GPCRs) [8], which are seven transmembrane\nreceptors, we focused our attention on these recep-\ntors to search for N-myristoylated transmembrane\nproteins.\nGPCRs represent a superfamily of proteins\nthe\nfunction of which is dependent on heterotrimeric\nGTP binding and hydrolyzing proteins (G-proteins).\nThey link the cells to their environment by receiving\nstimuli, relaying the message to the cells, and regula-\nting the cellular response [9,10]. GPCRs represent one\nof the largest protein superfamilies in the eukaryotic\ngenome [11,12]. In fact,  9000 entries are listed in the\nGPCR database which is available as a public WWW-\nserver (http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/) [13]. To search for\nN-myristoylated GPCRs, possible candidates with an\nN-myristoylation consensus motif at their N-termini\nwere ﬁrst extracted from the GPCR database and then\nthe susceptibility of the proteins to protein N-myristoy-\nlation was examined experimentally. It was found that\nthe N-terminus of B96Bom [14,15], a Bombyx mori\nGPCR (tyramine receptor), is efﬁciently N-myristoylat-\ned and that\nthe N-myristoylated N-terminus of\nB96Bom is translocated across the membrane and\nexposed to the extracellular surface. To our knowledge,\nthis is the ﬁrst report showing that a eukaryotic trans-\nmembrane protein can be N-myristoylated and that the\nN-myristoylated N-terminus of\nthe protein can be\ntranslocated across the membrane.\nThe N-terminus of B96Bom, an insect GPCR,\nis N-myristoylated\nTo search for N-myristoylated transmembrane pro-\nteins, the susceptibility of the N-terminal sequence of\nseveral GPCRs to protein N-myristoylation was evalu-\nated by metabolic labeling using an in vitro translation\nsystem.

         "Service de Bacte´riologie-Virologie, Hoˆpital de Biceˆtre, Assistance Publique/Hoˆpitaux de Paris, Faculte´ de\nMe´decine Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin Biceˆtre, France\nSeveral expanded-spectrum -lactamase bla      genes are associated with ISEcp1-like elements in Enter-\nobacteriaceae. We found that ISEcp1B was able to mobilize the adjacent bla         gene by a transpositional\nmechanism in Escherichia coli by recognizing a variety of DNA sequences as right inverted repeats.\nAn increasing number of reports of expanded-spectrum\n-lactamases of the CTX-M type and plasmid-mediated cepha-\nlosporinases of the AmpC type in Enterobacteriaceae raise the\nquestion of their acquisition (5, 24, 26). The bla      genes\nbelonging to three out of the ﬁve known clusters (the CTX-\nM-1, -M-2, and -M-9 clusters) are associated with ISEcp1-like\ninsertion sequences (IS) (2, 5–7, 11, 12, 18, 21, 23). Neverthe-\nless, the distance that separates the -lactamase gene from\nISEcp1 varies within a given cluster of CTX-M-type genes,\nindicating that different insertion events have occurred (13,\n19). Analysis of GenBank databases reveals that some plasmid-\nencoded cephalosporinase genes, such as the bla   -type\ngenes, may also be associated with ISEcp1 (3, 10, 17).\nISEcp1 is an IS weakly related to other IS elements and\nbelonging to the IS1380 family (IS Database HomePage\n[http://www-is.biotoul.fr/page-is.html]) (8). Nothing is known\nabout the mobilization properties of ISEcp1. Recently, we\ncharacterized ISEcp1B associated with a bla         gene in a\nKlebsiella pneumoniae ILT-3 clinical\nisolate from Vietnam\n(21). ISEcp1B differs from ISEcp1 (GenBank accession no.\nAJ242809) by three nucleotide substitutions. Their inverted\nrepeat (IR) sequences are identical, and their transposases\ndiffer by a single amino acid change (18). Since ISEcp1-like\nelements are located upstream of several -lactamase genes,\nanalysis of the variable sequences separating these IS elements\nfrom the initiation codons of these genes allowed us to deter-\nmine its boundaries.\nRecently, it has been shown that ISEcp1B brought promoter\nsequences for high-level expression of the bla            ,\n-lactamase genes that belong to\nbla        , and bla\nthe same bla        subgroup (5, 6, 18) and might be also\nresponsible for their mobilization. The aim of this study was to\nanalyze the mobilization process mediated by ISEcp1B.\nISEcp1B possesses two imperfect IRs likely made of 14 bp,\npreviously estimated to be 18 bp (18), with 12 of these 14 bp\nbeing complementary (Table 1). A detailed analysis of a ca.\n9.5-kb DNA fragment from natural plasmid pILT-3 from K.\npneumoniae ILT-3 revealed that the gene encoding ORF1 in\ntransposon Tn1721 was interrupted by a 4.8-kb potential trans-\nposon bracketed on the left side by the left IR (IRL) of\nISEcp1B and on the right side by an imperfect right IR (IRR)\nnamed IRR1 made of a 14-bp sequence belonging to a gene\nencoding a putative iron transport protein (Fig. 1) (18). This\npotential transposon comprises ISEcp1B, bla        , IS903D,\nand part of the gene encoding an iron transport protein. We\nhave hypothesized that ISEcp1B could mobilize adjacent se-\nquences by transposition.\nSeveral transposition experiments were performed to deter-\nmine (i) the mobility of this potential transposon, (ii) the role\nof ISEcp1B in mobilizing the adjacent -lactamase gene, and\n(iii) the role of IS903D. Different recombinant plasmids were\nconstructed by inserting PCR products that encompassed ei-\nther one or both ISs that bracketed the bla         gene in\nplasmid pILT-3 into the EcoRV site of plasmid pACYC184\n(Table 2) and then transformed into Escherichia coli reference\nstrain DH10B. Recombinant plasmids were constructed with\nthe pACYC184 backbone to prevent overexpression of the\nISEcp1B transposase. Plasmid pC-1 contained the sequences\nof the potential transposon identiﬁed in plasmid pILT-3,\nwhereas the following constructs lacked the right part of it\n(Fig. 1). Plasmid pC-2 possessed the ISEcp1B sequence but\nlacked part of IS903D, and plasmid pC-3 possessed the entire\nIS903D sequence and a truncated ISEcp1B transposase gene\n(Fig. 1; Table 2). E. coli RR1023 (pOX38) was transformed by\nelectroporation with these recombinant plasmids (Table 2) (9).\nPlasmid pOX38 is a self-conjugative and IS-free plasmid.\nTransposition events were searched between inserts of several\nrecombinant plasmids and recipient plasmid pOX38 after 24 h\nof growth in Trypticase soy broth. Transfer of the recombinant\nplasmids with the pOX38 backbone into streptomycin-resistant\nE. coli reference strain DH10B (Table 2) was then performed by\nconjugation as described previously (20), and transconjugants\nwere selected on agar plates containing 100 g of amoxicillin per\nml (plasmid resistance marker) and 20 g of streptomycin per ml\n(chromosomal marker). Several amoxicillin-resistant transconju-\ngants were extracted and sequenced in part.\nSusceptibility to chloramphenicol was always observed in\ntransconjugant strains, thus ruling out full integration (chlor-\namphenicol resistance) of the recombinant plasmids derived\nfrom pACYC184 into plasmid pOX38. Detection of ISEcp1B\nand IS903D was performed using two sets of primers (primer\nISEcp1A [Table 2] in combination with primer ISEcp1B [5-T\nTTCCGCAGCACCGTTTGC-3] and primer IS903A [5-CA\nCATGAAATCATCTGCGC-3] in combination with primer\nIS903B [Table 2], respectively).\nAmoxicillin-resistant\ntransconjugants were not obtained\nwhen E. coli RR1023 (pC-3) lacking ISEcp1B (Fig. 1) was used\nas a donor, suggesting that the IS903D element located down-\nstream of the -lactamase gene did not mobilize this latter\ngene. On the other hand, amoxicillin-resistant transconjugants\nwere obtained when E. coli RR1023 (pC-1) and E. coli RR1023\n(pC-2) were used as donors with a transposition efﬁciency of\nca. 10   per donor. These results indicated that ISEcp1B was\nessential for movement of the bla         gene.\nUsing E. coli RR1023 (pC-1) as a donor, all amoxicillin-\nresistant transconjugants except one contained ISEcp1B and\nIS903D elements, with the bla         gene and DNA se-\nquences being located on the right part of IS903D in plasmid\npILT-3 (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, none of the 11 transconjugants\nthat were sequenced had the entire potential transposon iden-\ntiﬁed in natural plasmid pILT-3. Nevertheless, the transposi-\ntion mechanism mediated by ISEcp1B was evident, since 5-bp\nduplications were observed at the insertion sites in plasmid\npOX38 (see below). These data suggested that the IRR se-\nquences recognized by ISEcp1B were located inside the poten-\ntial transposon. Analysis of the boundaries of the transposed\nfragments identiﬁed sequences, similar to that of the IRR of\nISEcp1B and deﬁned as IRR-like sequences, that had been\nrecognized as such by the transposase of ISEcp1B during a\nmobilization process.\nFive different IRRs (IRR4 to IRR8) (Table 1) were identi-\nﬁed in ﬁve amoxicillin-resistant transconjugants that were an-\nalyzed, four of them being located in the gene encoding the\niron transport protein and one of them being located in the\ntnpA gene of IS903D (Table 2; Fig. 1). The number of identical\nbase pairs among the sequence deﬁned as IRR varied from\nthree to six, corresponding to less than 50%.\nAnalysis of E. coli RR1023 (pOX38) transconjugants resis-\ntant to amoxicillin, obtained with plasmid pC-2 as a donor, and\nthus lacking the sequence used as IRR in pILT-3, also showed\nthat transposition had occurred using nearby sequences of\npACYC184. The IRR-like sequences bracketing the trans-\nposed fragment in these transconjugants remained unchanged.\nThey shared 9 of 14 bp of the perfect IRR sequence (Table 1)\nand corresponded to a segment belonging to the cloning vec-\ntor. In order to rule out\nthe speciﬁc sequence of\nthat\npACYC184 may play a role in this transposition process, the\nsame inserted PCR product of pC-2 was cloned into the SmaI\nsite of pBK-CMV, giving rise to pC-2K (Table 2; Fig. 1).\nAnalysis of several amoxicillin-resistant transconjugants ob-\ntained with plasmid pC-2K as a donor also showed that trans-\nposition had occurred by involving sequences of pBK-CMV.\nThe IRR-like sequences bracketing the transposed fragment in\nthese transconjugants were always the same and shared 9 of\nthe 14 bp of a perfect IRR (Table 1). These results indicated\nthat sequences of pACYC184 (IRR2) or of pBK-CMV (IRR3)\nmight be used as IRRs by ISEcp1B, but further repeated ex-\nperiments are needed to assess this hypothesis. The reason why\nthe IRR1 of the potential transposon of pILT-3 was not the\nboundary of the transposed fragments in these in vitro exper-\niments remains intriguing. One explanation could be that\nIRR2 and IRR3 share greater nucleotide identity in their 3\nextremities (7 and 8, respectively, of last 10 bp) to a perfect\nIRR than IRR1 (only 6 of last 10 bp).\nNo consensus sequence could be determined by comparing\nthese 14-bp-long IRR sequences of recombinant plasmids and\nthe IRR sequences of ISEcp1B in pILT-3 (Table 1). Neverthe-\nless, a guanosine residue located at the 3 end of these IRRs\nwas always found, likely indicating that this nucleotide was\nnecessary in the transposition process. In addition, the last two\nnucleotides of these IRR sequences were either GG or CG.\nThese data indicated that ISEcp1B was involved in a transpo-\nsition process with weakly related IRRs.\nAnalysis of the insertion sites of ISEcp1B-mediated trans-\nposition revealed variable sequences in recombinant plasmids\n(AAGAA, TATAA, TATTA, GCTGA, ATATC, TAATA,\nTTTAC, AATGA, TTATA, ATAAG, and TGATT). No con-\nsensus sequence was identiﬁed among the 5-bp duplicated\nsites, whereas an AT-rich content that may target ISEcp1-\nmediated transposition as observed for IS1 was noticed (16,\n27). In silico analysis of six ISEcp1-like sequences associated\nwith bla     -like or bla   -like -lactamase genes available\nin the GenBank databases did not identify target site duplica-\ntions just bracketing the insertion sites of ISEcp1-like se-\nlikely indicates that after insertion,\nquences. This result\nISEcp1-like elements may be responsible for mobilization of\nthe adjacent sequences. In addition, this in silico analysis con-\nﬁrmed that the 5-bp sequences adjacent to the IRLs and IRRs\nof ISEcp1 elements were always AT rich.\nISEcp1B may use a wide range of DNA sequences as IRRs\nduring a mobilization process that involves its adjacent se-\nquences, therefore explaining its ability to mobilize structurally\nunrelated -lactamase genes. Similar observations have been\nmade for IS1247 of Xanthobacter autotrophicus, which also\nbelongs to the IS1380 family (25). A single copy of IS1247 may\nmobilize sequences located at its right-end extremity in what is\nconsidered a one-ended transposition process since only a sin-\ngle IS is involved.\nThese results may also be compared to those obtained with\nother IS elements, such as IS91 and IS911, that are responsible\nfor mobilization of adjacent sequences by a one-ended trans-\nposition mechanism (4, 22). In addition, transposition of other\nelements belonging to the Tn3 family, such as Tn21, generates\nvariable endpoints as a consequence of one-ended transposi-\ntion (1, 15). This peculiar process is the consequence of rec-\nognition of several different IR sequences by the Tn21 trans-\nposase, generating novel joint molecules (14). However, in our\ncase, some homology between the different IRRs used by\nISEcp1B is noticed, whereas one-ended transposition (for ex-\nample, with Tn21) requires one ﬁxed end and another random\none.\nIn the present study, we have demonstrated the ability for\n-lactamase gene.

         "Tissue remodelling is dependent on the integration of signals\nthat control turnover of ECM (extracellular matrix). Breakdown\nand endocytosis of collagen, a major component of the ECM, is\ncentral to this process. Whereas controlled secretion of matrix-\ndegrading enzymes (such as matrix metalloproteinases) has long\nbeen known to mediate ECM breakdown, it is becoming clear\nthat uPARAP/Endo180 (where uPARAP stands for urokinase\nplasminogen activator receptor-associated protein) serves as a\nreceptor that mediates endocytosis of collagen by several types of\ncells. In the liver, the stellate cells play a major role in turnover\nof ECM including collagens. These cells synthesize various colla-\ngens and also produce matrix metalloproteinases. In the present\nstudy, we investigated the capacity of rat hepatic stellate cells\nto endocytose and degrade    I-labelled heat-denatured collagen\nI. It was found that the collagen is efﬁciently taken up and\ndegraded by these cells. Degradation was inhibited by inhibitors of\nlysosomal proteases (leupeptin and E-64d) and the vacuolar pro-\nton pump (concanamycin A), indicating that it takes place in lyso-\nsomes. Furthermore, endocytosed FITC-labelled collagen was\nshown to reach late endocytic compartments in which it co-\nlocalized with LysoTracker (a marker of late endocytic compart-\nments). Competition experiments showed that uPA and unlabelled\ncollagen are capable of inhibiting binding and uptake of [   I]col-\nlagen in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Western-blot\nanalysis of cell lysate (using a polyclonal rabbit human-Endo180\nantiserum) revealed a single band at 180 kDa. In addition,\nthe antiserum was capable of reducing [   I]collagen binding\nto the cell surface. Finally, using two primers designed from the\nhuman uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA sequence, the expression of\nuPARAP/Endo180 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase–\nPCR. These results together suggest\nthat uPARAP/Endo180\nmediates endocytosis of collagen in rat liver stellate cells.\nKey words: collagen receptor, denatured collagen, lysosomal de-\ngradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, urokinase plasminogen\nactivator receptor-associated protein (uPARAP).\nHepatic stellate cells are located within the perisinusoidal space\nbetween the basolateral surface of hepatocytes and the endothelial\ncells [1]. They are relatively scarce, < 10 % of the total resident\nliver cells are stellate cells [2]. A number of important functions\nhave been attributed to stellate cells. They store vitamin A,\nreceived from the neighbouring hepatocytes [3,4], and, since they\nencircle the hepatic sinusoids and have contractile properties,\nthey may regulate blood ﬂow through the sinusoids [5–7]. They se-\ncrete cytokines and express a number of receptors that play a\ncentral role in cell–matrix and cell–cell interactions, both in\nnormal and in injured liver [2,8]. The stellate cells exhibit two\nmain phenotypes, the ‘quiescent state’ and the ‘activated state’.\nThe quiescent cells have low proliferation rate and low ﬁbrogenic\nactivity, but after any injury to the liver the cells shift towards\na myoﬁbroblastic-like phenotype [2,5,8]. A similar activation\nprocess is observed when primary stellate cells are kept in culture\non plastic support [9,10]: the cells elongate, lose their vitamin A\ndroplets and develop myoﬁlaments in their cytoplasm [5,8]. The\nactivated cells gain functions such as proliferation and produce\nvarious growth factors and most of the ECM (extracellular\nmatrix) components [9–12]. Activated stellate cells also produce\nenzymes that can degrade the normal pericellular ECM before\nsynthesis of ﬁbrous tissue. Such enzymes include MMPs (matrix\nmetalloproteinases), a family of zinc-dependent enzymes [13,14].\nAlthough activated stellate cells produce several factors needed\nfor ECM degradation, it is conceivable that they in addition may\nremove components of the ECM by means of endocytosis. Very\nfew studies have focused on this process in stellate cells. It was\nshown by using an in vitro system that retinol-binding protein,\nreleased from hepatocytes may be internalized in the stellate cells\nby receptor-mediated endocytosis [4]. A similar mechanism may\noperate when stellate cells take up retinol-binding protein from\nblood [15].\nThe aim of the present study was to determine whether stellate\ncells are able to endocytose collagen, a main component of the\nECM. To this end we used cultured rat stellate cells, and heat-\ndenatured collagen I, labelled with    I, was chosen as a repres-\nentative ligand. Initial experiments demonstrated that the stellate\ncells internalize and degrade [   I]collagen, and that the degrad-\nation is reduced by inhibitors of lysosomal function, indicating\nthat the cells are able to endocytose [   I]collagen. Moreover, the\nbinding of [   I]collagen was shown to be saturable, indicating\nthat it is receptor-mediated. Further investigations indicated that\nthe receptor in question could be the surface receptor uPARAP/\nEndo180 [where uPARAP",

         "The amygdala is important in generating emotional context for\nsituations and events (LeDoux, 2000; Everitt et al., 2003; Phillips\net al., 2003). For example, functional neuroimaging studies in\nhumans show that the amygdala is activated during recognition\nof fearful and happy facial expressions (Morris et al., 2002; Hare\net al., 2005). The amygdala also appears to be involved in evalu-\nating the reward value of a stimulus (Malkova et al., 1997; Par-\nkinson et al., 2001). All of these findings are consistent with the\nview that the amygdala is important for assessing the affective (or\nemotional) valence of a stimulus and/or production of a specific\naffective state (Everitt et al., 2003; Phillips et al., 2003).\nWe have been studying how the brain uses external stimuli,\nparticularly visual cues, to predict how much work (compare\nwith number of trials) is needed to get a reward (visually cued\nreward schedule task) (Bowman et al., 1996). The visual cue,\nwhich predicts the work load remaining in the current schedule,\naffects the monkey’s motivational and probably emotional states;\nbecause the visual cue progressively indicates that more work\nremains, the error rates and reaction times increase. The increases\nin error rates and reaction times indicate the monkeys are less\nmotivated. This decrease in motivation in turn shows that the\ncues indicating that more work remains negatively affect the\nmonkey’s emotional state in that the monkeys become less in-\nclined to complete the current trial correctly. Single neuron re-\ncording studies have identified robust signals related to this type\nof reward expectancy in the ventral striatum (Shidara et al.,\n1998), the perirhinal cortex (Liu and Richmond, 2000), and the\nanterior cingulate cortex (Shidara and Richmond, 2002).\nHere we report on single neuronal recordings from monkeys\nperforming this reward schedule task in the basolateral complex\nof the amygdala, a region that receives input from the anterior\ntemporal lobe, including area TE (Cheng et al., 1997) and rhinal\ncortex (Stefanacci et al., 1996), and is high in dopamine (Sadikot\nand Parent, 1990). The signals carried by amygdala neurons, by\ncoding for schedule and the reward contingency, could be used to\nresolve ambiguity about the upcoming reward. The anatomical\nconnections and timing relations of the signals suggest that the\namygdala may be part of a temporal lobe network that takes\ninformation about stimulus identity from temporal lobe sensory\nareas and generates signals that interpret the external stimuli or\nevents by providing an emotional context, allowing the animal to\norganize its behavior.\nSurgical preparation\nRecording of single neuronal activity\nRecording sites localization\nData analysis\nAnimals, behavioral task, and visual stimuli\nBehavioral and electrophysiological data were collected while two\nadult rhesus monkeys performed the visually cued reward sched-\nule task (Fig. 1).\nBehavioral analysis\nAs seen previously (Bowman et al., 1996; Shidara et al., 1998; Liu\nand Richmond, 2000; Shidara and Richmond, 2002), the mon-\nkeys were sensitive to the cue and the work schedule in the valid\ncue condition (Fig. 2 A). The error rates and reaction times were\nindistinguishable across the three rewarded trials, 1/1, 2/2, and\n3/3 (single-factor ANOVA to the two monkeys together; mean\n 1.79, p  0.05; mean reaction times, F\nerror rates, F\n 0.0022, p  0.05). The error rates and reaction times were\nsignificantly different across the first trials, 1/1, 1/2, and 1/3 (sin-\n 46.72, p  0.0001;\ngle factor ANOVA; mean error rates, F\n 73.7, p  0.0001), showing that\nmean reaction times, F\nthe monkeys were sensitive to the information provided by the\ncue about the schedule.\nBoth monkeys reacted progressively more quickly as the re-\nwarded trial approached in the two- and three-trial schedules\n(single-factor ANOVA with repeated measures for effect of\n 314.3, p \nschedule progress, two-trial schedule, F\n 324.8, p  0.0001).

Kloos , Carlo M. Croce*, and Albert de la Chapelle*\napillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common\nmalignancy in thyroid tissue, accounting for 80% of all\nthyroid cancers. The incidence of PTC in the United States has\nincreased in recent years (1). Genetically, PTC is characterized\nby alterations in the RETPTC-RAS-BRAF signaling pathway\n(2, 3). Activating mutations in BRAF and RETPTC gene\nrearrangements are frequent genetic changes in PTC tumors\n(4–6). A strong inherited genetic predisposition is suggested by\ncase-control studies showing a 3- to 8-fold risk in first-degree\nrelatives, one of the highest of all cancers (7, 8). Despite\nunequivocal evidence of an inherited predisposition, large fam-\nilies displaying Mendelian inheritance of PTC are rare, and no\npredisposing gene mutations have been found, even though\nseveral putative loci have been identified by linkage analysis\n(9–11).\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a previously uncharacter-\nized class of gene products that are believed to function as\nnegative regulators of gene expression (12–16). Recently,\nmiRNA genes have been implicated in several cancers (14,\n17–25). The expression of miRNAs varies between cancer and\nnormal cells and varies among different types of cancer. In most\ncancers studied so far, the expression of miRNAs seems to be\nlower than in the corresponding normal tissue (17, 18, 21, 22, 24).\nWe reasoned that the previous failure to identify genes\npredisposing or contributing to PTC might be because these\ngenes show low penetrance. The mechanisms may require the\ninteraction of two or more genes; thus, regulatory, rather than\nprotein-encoding, genes might be involved. We undertook this\nstudy to elucidate the role of regulatory genes such as the\nmiRNAs in the predisposition and development of PTC.\nMethods\nAfter approval of the Institutional Review Board and patient\nconsent, fresh samples from the tumor tissue PTC (T-PTC) and\nnormal thyroid tissue adjacent to PTC tumors (N-PTC) were\nobtained from 20 patients with sporadic PTC undergoing sur-\ngical resection. The samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen\nand stored at 80°C. Clinical data and information on the\nspecimens are shown in Table 2, which is published as supporting\ninformation on the PNAS web site. Normal thyroid tissue\n(N-Thy, n  6) was collected from consenting individuals who\nhad surgery because of laryngeal malignancy but no thyroid\ndisease. Other samples included: paraffin blocks of thyroid tissue\nfrom Finnish sporadic PTC patients (n  135); blood DNA\nindividuals (n  100);\nsamples of random Finnish control\nlymphoblastoid cell DNA samples (n  24) from Centre d’Etude\ndu Polymorphisme Humain control individuals who are not\ngenetically related. Thyroid cancer cell lines K1, K2, and NPA87\nwere cultured in DMEM mixed with F12 and MCDB (ratio\n2:1:1) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and glutamine in a\n5% CO  incubator. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted\nfrom the samples by standard techniques. Total RNA was\nextracted with TRIzol solution (Invitrogen), and the integrity of\nRNA was assessed by using an Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agi-\nlent, Palo Alto, CA).\nBiotin-labeled miRNA was hybridized on\nmiRNA chips as described in ref. 26. Briefly, 5 g of total RNA\nfrom each sample was reverse transcribed by using biotin end-\nlabeled random octamers. Hybridization was carried out on our\nnew custom miRNA microarray chip (OSUCCC version 2.0),\nwhich contained 460 mature miRNA probes spotted in quadru-\nplicate (235 Homo sapiens, 222 Mus musculus, and 3 Arabidopsis\nthaliana) with annotated active sites. The hybridized chips were\nwashed and processed to detect biotin-containing transcripts by\nstreptavidin-Alexa647 conjugate and scanned by using an Axon\n4000B (Axon Instruments). Scanned images were quantified by\n(Axon Instruments).\nAffymetrix HG-U133 plus two chips\n(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were used to evaluate genome-\nwide gene expression levels. The experimental procedure was\naccording to the Affymetrix Gene-Chip Expression Analysis\nmanual. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized by using the\nSuperscript Choice System, followed by an in vitro transcription\nreaction with a T-7 (dT24) primer to produce biotinylated\ncRNA. The full-length cRNAs were fragmented to 20 to 200 bp\nand hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133\nPlus 2.0 Array.\nRaw data\nfrom miRNA chips were assembled by using BRB ArrayTools\n(Richard Simon and Amy Peng Lam, National Cancer Institute,\nBethesda). BRB ArrayTools generated an average value of the\nfour spot replicates for each miRNA. Background subtracted\nintensities were thresholded to 10 and log transformed.

         "5, which is published as supporting\ninformation on the PNAS web site).\nDiscussion\nA relatively unexpected finding of ours was the highly prefer-\nential\nincrease rather than decrease in transcript of many\nmiRNA genes in the tumors compared with paired unaffected\nthyroid tissue. Such up-regulation has previously been noted in\na few cancers, but decreases in the tumor seem to be more\ncommon (21, 22, 24). For example, miR-15 and miR-16 are\nfrequently down-regulated in B cell chronic lymphocytic leuke-\nmia (17); miR-143 and miR-145 showed decreased expression in\ncolorectal tumors (34); miRNA let-7 was down-expressed in\nhuman lung cancer, which is associated with poor prognosis (24).\nDown-expression of miRNAs was also found in cancers of the\nbreast, kidney, prostate, and uterus (21, 22). Over-expression of\nmiRNAs was reported in some tumors: miR-155 was overex-\npressed in Burkitt’s lymphomas and human B cell lymphoma\n(35), and a cluster of miRNAs, the miR-17–92 polycistron, were\noverexpressed in B cell lymphoma patients (23). Although we\nhave no clear explanation of the preferential up- rather than\ndown-regulation of miRNAs in PTC, we note that this cancer has\nunusually little loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (36, 37). If LOH is\ngenerally associated with loss of mRNA transcript, then the\npaucity of LOH might, in part, explain our findings. It follows\nthat genomic amplification might explain abundant miRNA\ntranscript.\nComparatively little is known about genetic changes in PTC,\nand no predisposing mutations have been described. Our find-\nings are compatible with the hypothesis that RNA-based regu-\nlatory mechanisms involving miRNAs, and possibly other RNA\ngenes, characterize this tumor. The existence of regulatory\nnetworks, including inherited changes therein, is now established\nin principle, although almost nothing is known about the genes\nthemselves (38).\nWe observed that miR-221 expression was not only up-\nregulated in PTC tumors, but also showed clear-cut variation in\nthe unaffected thyroid tissue among patients with PTC. In at\nleast 3 of 15 patients, the up-regulation was strong. This obser-\nvation suggests that unaffected normal thyroid tissue adjacent to\ntumors may harbor genetic changes before the appearance of\nmorphological malignancy. Overexpression of miR-221 could be\na premalignant change in PTC. Taken together, miRNA dereg-\nulation in the thyroid could be a critical component of PTC\ninitiation and development. We hypothesize that miR-221 may\nfunction as an oncogene in the thyroid. Future study is warranted\nto explore the significance of the overexpression of miRNAs in\nthyroid tissues from PTC patients.\nKit is an important tyrosine kinase receptor in cell differen-\ntiation and growth; it functions as an oncogene in many cancers\n(39, 40). The transcript level of KIT in PTC tumor cells is known\nto be extremely low (41, 42), which is consistent with our data.\nIn contrast, reports about the protein level in PTC are contra-\ndictory (43, 44). Although in several PTC tumors we found Kit\nprotein to be down-regulated, this observation did not apply to\nall tumors, emphasizing the complexity of these regulatory\npathways, which may well be organ- or cell-specific.\nComputational predictions and experimental approaches sup-\nport the idea that different miRNAs target the same mRNA\n(29). Multiple miRNAs have been predicted to target KIT,\nincluding those overexpressed in PTC (27, 29, 31). We show here\nthat in most PTCs at least three miRs (221, 222, and 146)\ntargeting KIT were up-regulated. It is entirely possible that the\nmultiple interaction opportunities provided by networks or\n‘‘signatures’’ of miRNA dysregulation create different responses\nin target genes under different circumstances and combinations.\nPerhaps most interestingly, our results highlight the role of the\ntarget genes themselves in their responses to miRNA interaction.\nWe found a SNP in KIT precisely in the crucial region of the 3\nUTR-binding domain for miR-221 and -222, and another SNP\nprecisely in the crucial region of the exonic binding domain for\nmiR-146a and -146b. The crucial region is a stretch of seven\nnucleotides in the miRNA:mRNA duplex, usually located in the\n5 end of the miRNA, starting at the first or second position. It\nis likely that variants within the binding regions can acquire new\nmiRNAs as regulating factors due to sequence changes such as\nSNPs. Remarkably, of 10 tumors in which the key miRNA genes\nwere up-regulated, all 10 showed low or very low KIT transcript,\nand 5 of these patients were the only ones (of 15 tested) showing\nheterozygosity for the germline SNPs. These findings suggest\nthat not only changes in miRNAs but also in their target genes\n(inherited or perhaps acquired) profoundly influence PTC car-\ncinogenesis. Our association study suggests that these events are\ndownstream of the putative genetic initiating or predisposing\nevents. More detailed functional studies must address questions\nsuch as how miR-221, -222, and -146b in",

         "rogrammed cell death occurs during organ development, and\nplays an important role in cellular homeostasis.  Three types of\ncell death are known: apoptosis (type I), autophagy (type II), and\nnecrosis (type III).  Apoptosis is induced by a number of stimuli,\nincluding anticancer drugs, growth factor deprivation, and irradia-\ntion. The molecular mechanism by which apoptosis occurs has been\nextensively examined. Apoptosis in response to chemotherapy is\nknown to correlate with a reduction in tumor volume, and resistance\nto apoptosis causes drug resistance.    Introduction of a proapoptotic\ngene such as Bax,    and inhibition of an antiapoptotic gene such as\nBcl-2,    enhances the effects of chemotherapy. Thus, apoptosis\nclearly inﬂuences the antitumor effect(s) of chemotherapeutic agents.\nIn solid tumors, hypoxia and glucose deprivation enable tumor\nprogression,   whereas depletion of adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP)\nresults in necrosis. The production of lactic acid under anaerobic\nconditions does not necessarily induce necrosis, rather, autophagic\ncell death may depend on susceptibility to apoptosis, which can be\ninhibited by activation of Akt by environmental stimuli.      Drug\nresistance might involve resistance to autophagic cell death, as well as\napoptosis. In fact, treatment with tamoxifen causes autophagy of\nMCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, as well as apoptotic cell death via a\ncaspase 3-independent pathway.   Autophagy is also induced by au-\nrintricarboxylic acid via activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in\nRas-mutated HT-29 colon carcinoma cells.   In addition, a human\ntumor suppressor gene, known as Beclin 1, induces autophagy.\nReduced expression of this gene occurs in breast and\novarian carcinoma due to a 40 –75% deletion of the\ngene.   Although resistance to autophagy and apopto-\nsis is likely involved in tumor progression and acqui-\nsition of drug resistance by solid tumors, the exact\nmolecular mechanism(s) by which this occurs, and the\nrelation between autophagy and apoptosis, remain\nunknown. Here, we review evidence regarding the\nmolecular mechanism(s) of anticancer drug-induced\ncell death and discuss potential therapeutic targets by\nwhich signal transduction pathways leading to cell\ndeath might be modulated by cancer therapy.\nGiven that a number of anticancer agents induce ap-\noptosis, a lot of research has focused on the various\npathways that mediate apoptosis. Two are known to\nmediate anticancer drug-induced apoptosis, a death\nreceptor-dependent (extrinsic) and a mitochondria-\ndependent (intrinsic) pathway.   The death receptor-\ndependent pathway involves activation of death re-\nceptors, such as Fas and TRAIL receptors (DR4, DR5).\nDeath receptor activation is mediated by a death-\ninducing signaling complex, which is formed by re-\ncruitment of a Fas-associated death domain and pro-\ncaspase 8 to the death receptor, thereby activating\ncaspase 8.     Caspase 8 directly activates caspase 3,\nleading to apoptosis (type I cell death).   The mito-\nchondria-dependent pathway involves cleavage of a\nproapoptotic protein, Bid, resulting in the production\nof truncated Bid (tBid), by caspase 8, within the mito-\nchondria. Heterodimerization of tBid and Bak results\nin release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and\nactivation of caspase 3 and caspase 9 (type II cell\ndeath).   The predominance of one pathway over an-\nother depends on cell type.\nUnlike the death receptor-dependent pathway,\nthe mitochondria-dependent pathway is mediated by\nBax/Bak and involves the release of cytochrome c.\nIn general, Bax is associated with 14-3-3 protein,\nwhich anchors Bax in the cytoplasm. However, in the\npresence of DNA damage, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal ki-\nnase phosphorylates 14-3-3, resulting in dissociation\nof Bax from this protein.

         "from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas\nPhytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in\nsome cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many\nbacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemi-\ncal and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phyto-\naeruginosa\nchrome\n(PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features\nof a bonaﬁde phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the\nchromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXa, which is pro-\nduced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore\nwas shown to be covalently attached via its A-ring endo-vinyl group to a\ncysteine residue outside the deﬁned bilin lyase domain of plant and cyano-\nbacterial phytochromes. Site-directed mutagenesis identiﬁed Cys12 and\nHis247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility,\nrespectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red-light-absorbing\nPr form and immediately converted into a far-red-light-absorbing Pfr-\nenriched form. It shows the characteristic red ⁄ far-red-light-induced photo-\nreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that\nlacks the\nC15 ⁄ 16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to\na 15Z ⁄ 15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphoryla-\ntion of PaBphP was demonstrated, conﬁrming its role as a sensor kinase of\na bacterial two-component signaling system.\nPhytochromes are biliprotein photoreceptors in plants\nbut have recently also been discovered in bacteria [1].\nIn plants, the family of phytochromes sense red and\nfar-red light and therefore play a key role in mediating\nresponses to light quality, quantity, direction and dur-\nation throughout plant development [2]. Plant phyto-\nchromes are homodimers composed of  125-kDa\nsubunits each with a thioether-linked phytochromobi-\nlin prosthetic group [3]. Unlike the light-harvesting\ncyanobacterial phycobiliproteins which require a lyase\nfor the covalent attachment of the linear tetrapyrrole\n(bilin) chromophore, bilin attachment to apo-phyto-\nchromes is autocatalytic [4]. The action of phyto-\nchrome depends on its ability to photointerconvert\nbetween the red-light-absorbing Pr form and the far-\nred-light-absorbing Pfr form, a property conferred by\nthe covalently bound phytochromobilin in the plant\nholophytochrome. The ﬁrst phytochrome from a bac-\nterial source to be discovered was Cph1 (cyanobac-\nterial phytochrome 1) from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803\nwhich was followed by the discovery of bacterial phy-\ntochromes (BphPs) from nonphotosynthetic bacteria\n[1,5,6]. BphPs are typical sensor kinases of a two-com-\nponent signaling system. Most BphPs including that of\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP) carry a C-terminal\nhistidine kinase module, and it has been shown that\nmany of them, such as Synechocystis Cph1 [6], Agro-\nbacterium Agp1 and Agp2 [7,8] and also Pseudomonas\nsyringae BphP [9], are light-regulated histidine kinases.\nUnlike plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes,\nwhich carry a phytochromobilin or phycocyanobilin\nchromophore, BphPs have been shown to utilize a bili-\nverdin chromophore [9]. Apart from Cph1, most mem-\nbers of the BphP family lack the conserved cysteine\nresidue in the conserved bilin lyase domain (BLD).\nThis domain has been deﬁned as the minimal GAF\ndomain, capable of autocatalytic assembly with bilin\nchromophores [10]. GAF domains are small\nligand-\nbinding domains found in vertebrate cGMP-speciﬁc\nphosphodiesterases, cyanobacterial adenylate cyclases\nand the formate hydrogen lyase transcription activator\nFhlA [11]. In most phytochromes, the BLD is preceded\nby the P2 domain, which is often recognized as a PAS\ndomain in the Pfam database (protein families data-\nbase; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/)\n[12].\nPAS domains are tandem repeats ﬁrst described in the\ntranscriptional regulatory proteins period clock (PER)\nfrom Drosophila melanogaster,\nthe murine aromatic\nhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)\nand single minded (SIM) from D. melanogaster [13].\nInterestingly, a cysteine residue in this P2 domain has\nbeen shown to be the site of chromophore attachment\nin Agp1\n[7,14].\nAnother characteristic domain in phytochromes is the\nPHY domain which corresponds to a GAF-related\ndomain located C-terminally to the BLD (Scheme 1).\nfrom Agrobacterium tumefaciens\nRecently we have shown that BphP from P. aerugi-\nnosa is able to bind biliverdin IXa and biliverdin IXd,\nwhich are produced by the two heme oxygenases BphO\nand PigA [15]. As bphO is chromosomally located\nupstream of bphP and the afﬁnity for biliverdin IXa\nwas about ﬁvefold higher than for biliverdin IXd, we\nconcluded that biliverdin IXa is the natural chromo-\nphore of PaBphP. Furthermore, we presented data\nindicating an involvement of BphP in biliverdin release\nfrom BphO, as this is the rate-limiting step of the\nBphO reaction.\nHere we describe the further biochemical and spect-\nroscopic characterization of BphP.\nExpression, puriﬁcation and initial characterization\nof recombinant P. aeruginosa phytochrome\nThe P. aeruginosa bphP was expressed using a tet pro-\nmoter-driven C-terminal Strep tag expression system.\nRecombinant BphP was always puriﬁed in the apo\nform, and the homogeneity after puriﬁcation was\n 98% (Fig. 1,\ninset). A single band migrating at\n 80 kDa was obtained on SDS ⁄ PAGE, which corre-\nlates with the predicted molecular mass calculated\nfrom the amino-acid composition (80.1 kDa). The\nyield of puriﬁed BphP was typically 5 mg per litre of\nbacterial culture. Analytical gel permeation chromato-\ngraphy revealed that the apo form, as well as the\nassembled holo form, of BphP is eluted as a dimer\nfrom a Superdex 200 column (data not shown; [15]).\nAssembly and chromophore binding\nPaBphP is able to autocatalytically form a photocon-\nvertible holo-phytochrome with the proposed natural\nchromophore biliverdin IXa. Illumination of recombin-\nant holo-BphP with saturating red light (630 nm) resul-\nted in the formation of the Pfr form (Pfr-enriched)\nwhich could be converted back into the Pr form through\nillumination with far-red light (750 nm) (Fig. 1A). The\nresultant calculated difference spectrum shows the char-\nacteristic phytochrome signature (Fig. 1B) with maxima\nof 700 and 754 nm for the Pr and Pfr form, respectively.\nThese far-red absorbance maxima seem to be typical of\nbiliverdin-binding phytochromes and represent the most\nred-shifted phytochrome forms described so far [7,16].\nThe covalent binding of biliverdin IXa was conﬁrmed\nby zinc-induced red ﬂuorescence (Fig. 3C).\nThe form initially synthesized after the addition of\nbiliverdin IXa to apo-BphP in the dark is the Pr form,\nwhich is immediately converted nonphotochemically\ninto a Pfr-enriched form. This nonphotochemical con-\nversion reaches an equilibrium between Pr and Pfr\nforms after 90 min (Fig. 2A). Irradiation with far-red\nlight leads to the formation of the Pr form with one\npeak at 700 nm, which can be converted back into the\nPfr form by irradiation with red light. Both the Pr and\nthe Pfr form are unstable in the dark and convert back\ninto a dark form, a Pfr-enriched mixture of Pr and Pfr\n(Fig. 2B,C).\nChromophore–protein interaction\nTo determine which part of the bilin chromophore is\ninvolved in covalent attachment to the protein, various\nbiliverdin derivatives were used (see Fig. 3B for chem-\nical structures). The resultant chromoproteins were\ncharacterized by red ⁄ far-red-light-induced difference\nspectroscopy (Fig. 3A). The spectral properties are\nsummarized in Table 1. BphP is able to covalently bind\nbiliverdin IXd and biliverdin XIIIa, which was con-\nﬁrmed by zinc-induced red ﬂuorescence (Fig. 3C). Fur-\nthermore, these biliverdin adducts were able to form\na photoconvertible holophytochrome. No characteristic\ndifference spectrum nor covalent binding was observed\nwith biliverdin IXb, biliverdin IXc, mesobiliverdin,\n3 ,3 -dihydrobiliverdin and biliverdin IIIa (Fig. 3B,C\nand [15]). The common feature of all covalently bound\nbiliverdin derivatives is an A-ring endo-vinyl group,\nindicating that this side chain is absolutely required for\ncovalent attachment. Furthermore, these results imply\nthat the ring substituents of the other pyrrole rings do\nnot seem to be critical for photoconversion.\nPhotoisomerization of PaBphP\nThe primary photoreaction of plant phytochromes is\nknown to be the 15Z ⁄ 15E isomerization of the phyto-\nchromobilin chromophore [17]. If the C15 double bond\nis missing (i.e. in phycoerythrobilin), the corresponding\nphytochrome adduct is unable to undergo photoiso-\nmerization but instead is highly ﬂuorescent [18]. This\nﬂuorescent adduct of phytochromes is also known as a\nphytoﬂuor [19]. To elucidate whether the photoisomeri-\nzation in PaBphP is also due to a 15Z ⁄ 15E isomeriza-\ntion of\nthe bilin prosthetic group (in this case\nbiliverdin), we incubated apo-BphP with 15,16-dihydro-\nbiliverdin (see Fig. 4 for structure). 15,16-Dihydrobiliv-\nerdin can be synthesized in vitro from biliverdin by the\nferredoxin-dependent bilin reductase PebA [20]. Apo-\nBphP is able to bind 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin and is\norange ﬂuorescent under UV light\n(312 nm). This\nphenomenon was investigated ﬂuorospectrometrically.\nExcitation at 570 nm resulted in a ﬂuorescent phyto-\nﬂuor with an emission maximum of 630 nm (Fig. 4).\nChromophore attachment site\nBphP lacks the conserved cysteine residue involved in\ncovalent bilin attachment in plant and most cyanobac-\nterial phytochromes, and therefore the site and kind of\nattachment of the bilin chromophore in the bacterial\nphytochromes is controversial [1,21,22]. To investigate\nwhether the chromophore is attached via a thioether\nlinkage to a cysteine residue, the protein was treated\nwith iodoacetamide. This reagent speciﬁcally modiﬁes\ncysteine residues. If a chromophore-binding cysteine is\naccessible to iodoacetamide, a subsequent covalent\nchromophore attachment should be inhibited. Addition\nof increasing amounts of iodoacetamide leads to a\nreduction in photoisomerzation, as visualized by differ-\nence spectroscopy and covalent chromophore binding\n(i.e. decreased zinc-induced red ﬂuorecence). Full inhi-\nbition was observed with 1 mm iodoacetamide (data\n[7,21]. C248 is\nnot shown). These results imply that the site of chro-\nmophore attachment in P. aeruginosa BphP is most\nlikely a cysteine residue. BphP contains twelve cysteine\nresidues, two of which, at position 12 and 248, could\npossibly serve as the chromophore-binding site. A cys-\nteine corresponding to position 12 has already been\nreported to be the site of chromophore attachment in\nAgp1 from A. tumefaciens\nlocated\nwithin the BLD and is adjacent to the chromophore-\nbinding site in cyanobacterial and plant phytochromes.\nTo further investigate the potential site of chromo-\nphore attachment, site-directed mutants (C12A, C12S\nand C248A) were generated and analyzed using the\nabove methods. Neither BphP C12A nor C12S showed\ncharacteristic difference spectra. The difference spectra\nof these variants (Fig. 5A) were very similar to the\niodoacetamide-blocked wild-type spectra (data not\nshown). The variant BphP C248A was able to form a\nphotoconvertible holoform with maximum and mini-\nmum identical with those of the wild-type (Table 2).\nOnly the C248A variant showed covalent biliverdin\nbinding, as demonstrated by zinc-induced red ﬂuores-\ncence (Fig. 5B). The covalent attachment of biliverdin\nto BphP was further conﬁrmed using a biliverdin\nreductase (BVR) assay. In this assay, only free biliver-\ndin can be converted by BVR into bilirubin. The addi-\ntion of BVR and NADPH to C12A:biliverdin and\nC12S:biliverdin resulted in the conversion of the bound\nbiliverdin into bilirubin, which was accompanied by a\ncolor change from green to yellow, indicating the forma-\ntion of bilirubin. No biliverdin conversion was detected\nafter addition of BVR to wild-type BphP and the other\nvariants investigated (data not shown). Overall, these\nresults are in agreement with the data from Agp1 and\nindicate the importance of Cys12 in covalent chromo-\nphore binding.\nBesides this N-terminally located cysteine residue, a\nhistidine residue in the BLD has been discussed as the\nchromophore-binding site in Deinococcus radiodurans\nBphP and Calothrix sp. PCC7601 CphB [1,23]. This his-\ntidine residue is located adjacent to the conserved cys-\nteine residue in cyanobacterial and plant phytochromes.\nTo investigate the role of this histidine residue, a H247Q\nmutant was generated. H247Q was able to form a pho-\ntoconvertible holoform with blue-shifted extrema (694\nand 746 nm) (Table 2). For this variant, covalent bili-\nverdin binding was demonstrated using zinc-induced\nred ﬂuorescence and the BVR assay (data not shown).\nAutophosphorylation of BphP\nLight-regulated His phosphorylation has been demon-\nstrated for several bacterial phytochromes. Amino-acid\nsequence analysis revealed that BphP also contains a\nhistidine kinase module (Scheme 1). Autophosphoryla-\ntion of BphP was determined after incubation of puri-\nﬁed apo-BphP and holo-BphP (Pr and Pfr form) with\n[  P]ATP[cP]. Both forms of BphP displayed auto-\nphosphorylation activity (Fig. 6A). Although the Pfr-\nenriched form shows slightly higher kinase actvity, no\nstrong light-dependence could be detected. BphP was\nconﬁrmed to be a histidine kinase, as the phosphoryla-\ntion was stable in alkaline solution and labile in acid\n(Fig. 6B). This was further conﬁrmed by replacing the\npotential phosphorylation site (H513) by alanine. No\nautophosphorylation was detected in this H513A\nmutant (data not shown).\nPaBphP is a bacterial phytochrome using a\nbiliverdin chromophore\nPaBphP was among the ﬁrst bacterial phytochromes\nto be discovered, and it has already been shown that\nthis BphP together with other members of this phyto-\nchrome class utilizes a biliverdin chromophore [1,9,15].\nthe\nOur laboratory has recently demonstrated that\nPaBphP chromophore is produced by one of the two\nP. aeruginosa heme oxygenases. The BphO heme oxy-\ngenase is encoded in the same operon as bphP, and we\nwere able to show that BphP is involved in the release\nof the biliverdin produced from BphO. The major\nfunction of BphP remains unknown, but these results\nprovide biochemical evidence that recombinant BphP\nhas all the characteristics of a red ⁄ far-red-light-respon-\nsive photoreceptor.\nTo date only a few bacterial phytochromes have\nbeen biochemically characterized in detail. Among\nthem are Agp1 and Agp2 (also known as AtBphP1\nand AtBphP2) from A. tumefaciens. The most interest-\ning spectral observation for several BphPs including\nPaBphP is the Pfr-like ground state [8,16]. Assembly\nof PaBphP with biliverdin ﬁrst generates a transient\nPr-like intermediate, which is then nonphotochemically\ntransformed into a stable Pfr-enriched form (Fig. 2A).\nInterestingly, illumination with red light does not fully\nconvert this form into a solely Pfr form (Fig. 2C). The\nPfr-enriched form found after dark assembly is differ-\nent from that obtained through dark conversion of\neither the Pr or Pfr forms (Fig. 2B,C). Incubation of\npre-illuminated BphP always resulted in the formation\nof a Pr ⁄ Pfr equilibrium in the dark.\nAlthough autophosphorylation activity was demon-\nstrated for BphP, only a weak light-dependence has\nbeen observed with the Pfr-enriched form diplaying\nhighest kinase activity. However, this may also be due\nto the amount of Pr present in the Pfr-enriched form.\nThe observed Pfr ground state is the opposite of that\nused by almost all other known members of the classic\nphytochrome family [12,24]. More recent reports also\nrevealed the presence of the Pfr ground state in Agp2\nfrom A. tumefaciens and the BphPs of Rhodopseudo-\nmonas palustris and Bradyrhizobium ORS278 [8,16].\nFor the latter organisms, the Pfr ground state has been\nimplicated to be necessary for maximal photoregula-\ntion of photosynthesis by not overlapping with chloro-\nphyll absorption [16]. The reason for the Pfr ground\nstate in Agp2 and PaBphP is still not known, but if\nPaBphP indeed functions as a photoreceptor\nin\nP. aeruginosa, it would be expected to serve as a sensor\nof the ratio between far-red and red light.\nAn A-ring endo-vinyl group is required for\ncovalent attachment\nOur data obtained using biliverdin derivatives and site-\ndirected mutagenesis of PaBphP are in agreement with\ndata obtained for Agp1 from A. tumefaciens [7,21].\nBoth BphPs seem to covalently bind the biliverdin\nchromophore at a conserved cysteine residue in the P2\ndomain close to the N-terminus of the protein. An\nA-ring endo-vinyl group of the chromophore is abso-\nlutely required for this covalent attachment [15,21].\nOur data support the proposal that the lack of the\nconserved cysteine residue in the BLD correlates with\nthe use of biliverdin as the chromophore and the bind-\ning to a conserved cysteine residue in the P2 domain\n[25]. Nevertheless, the BLD still seems to be quite\nimportant for the photochemical reaction, as a H247Q\nmutation resulted in a spectral shift of the Pr and Pfr\nforms. Therefore, the BLD may play a role in stabil-\nthe chromophore and\nization and co-ordination of\npossibly its covalent attachment to Cys12 (i.e. the bilin\nlyase function).\nInterestingly, PaBphP Cys12 mutants assembled bili-\nverdin, but the afﬁnity of biliverdin was about ﬁvefold\nlower than wild-type BphP. The assembled Cys12 vari-\nants displayed a Pr-like aborption spectrum, which did\nnot alter upon red-light illumination (data not shown).\nThis observation is in contrast with data obtained for\nAgp1. An Agp1 C20A mutant was fully photoreversi-\nble, but had a reduced absorption coefﬁcient, a blue-\nshifted Pfr maximum, and a reduced ratio of Pfr to Pr\nabsorption [7]. In the case of PaBphP, the mutation of\nthis conserved cysteine residue is much more dramatic\nthan in Agp1. It seems that, in PaBphP, mutation of\nthis residue not only abolishes covalent binding, but\nstabilization of the Pfr form is also lost. This may be\ndue to a loosely or wrongly oriented biliverdin in the\nchromophore pocket. At this point it is worth men-\ntioning that, although many of our data point towards\nCys12 as the site of covalent chromophore attachment,\nit still cannot be ruled out that this cysteine residue\nonly plays a structural role (i.e. disulﬁde bond forma-\ntion). Consequently, its mutation would lead to a loss\nof the structural environment necessary for covalent\nbinding.\nPhotoconversion of BphPs involves 15Z ⁄ 15E\nisomerization\nit has always been\nSince the discovery of BphPs,\nassumed that the photochemical reaction is similar to\nthat found in plant phytochromes, which involves a\n15Z ⁄ 15E isomerization of the phytochromobilin chro-\nmophore [17]. This assumption has not yet been\nexperimentally conﬁrmed. We used a chromophore\nanalog that lacks the C15 ⁄ C16 double bond to investi-\ngate the photoisomerization of BphP. The phytoﬂuor\nthe\nadduct obtained conﬁrmed the involvement of\nC15 ⁄ C16 double bond in photoisomerization, as the\ndihydrobiliverdin adduct is highly ﬂuorescent. Further-\nmore, these data imply that, although the chromo-\nphore is attached at a different position, the geometry\nin PaBphP is\nof\nprobably similar to that of plant phytochromes.\nthe chromophore-binding poc",

         "MRC International Nutrition Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E 7HT,\nUK and MRC Keneba, Keneba, The Gambia\nThe obesity epidemics of many afﬂuent nations have\nrecently started to coalesce and to engulf many less-\nafﬂuent countries. Quite remarkably, it is even penetrating\nthe world’s poorest countries in their urban areas (van der\nSande et al. 2001), as well as the rural areas of countries a\nlittle more advanced along the epidemiological transition.\nThe very high levels of obesity in some of the least-\nprivileged peoples, in whom circumstance has encouraged\na rapid acculturation of diets and lifestyle (e.g. the Pima\nIndians of Arizona and Nauruan Polynesians), have\ngenerated seminal studies of obesity and diabetes over\nrecent decades, and have illustrated the investigative power\nof studying rapid cultural and behavioural\ntransitions\n(Bindon & Baker, 1997; Zimmet et al. 1997). The purpose\nof the present review is to try to extend these speciﬁc\nexamples to a more general interpretation of lessons that\nmight be learnt by considering the early development of\nthe obesity trend within populations assumed to have been\nadapted to frugal environments until the very recent past.\nSpecial attention will be given to the twin concepts of the\n‘thrifty phenotype’ and ‘thrifty genotype’.\nThrifty phenotypes\nThe thrifty phenotype concept, of an adaptively growth-\nrestricted organism, has existed for many decades but has\nbeen most clearly articulated by Hales & Barker (1992,\n2001), who also coined the term ‘thrifty phenotype’. The\nconcept has been described in some detail in another paper\nin this symposium (Stocker et al. 2005), so current\ncomments will be restricted to a few speciﬁc observations\nin relation to the developing country setting.\nIt\nis in such countries that\nthe majority of growth-\nrestricted (or small-for-gestational-age) babies are born.\nThe currently-accepted thesis is that\nthis early growth\nrestriction will represent a successful adaptation (although\nso long as the nutritional\nnot being without costs)\ncircumstances in later life continue to match those that\nhave induced the initial adaptation. Hence, it has been\nshown in The Gambia that small babies, including those\nborn during a nutritionally-debilitating hungry season,\nmaintain excellent cardiovascular health into adulthood,\nwith a complete absence of the metabolic syndrome, so\nlong as they retain their ‘lean, ﬁt and frugal’ lifestyle in the\nrural areas (Moore et al. 2001). In practice, however, this\nlifestyle is frequently not retained and many individuals\nwho have experienced fetal and early-life nutritional\nhardships transfer to the urban areas and to a diet of\nrelative energy excess with high intakes of fats and reﬁned\ncarbohydrates (Popkin, 2001, 2002; Adair & Prentice,\n2004). It is this rapid transition within a single lifespan that\nis implicated by many researchers as a crucial causative\nagent in the explosion of non-communicable diseases in\nmany such urban areas.\nFetal growth restriction in developing countries has\nmultifactorial origins, but attempts to quantify the con-\ntribution attributable to each cause indicate that under-\nnutrition is likely to be the most important single factor\n(Kramer, 1987, 2003). Both acute and chronic exposures\ncan be critical, although it seems likely that acute energy\nor nutrient insufﬁciency has to be quite harsh before it has\nreproducibly demonstrable effects on the baby (Susser,\n1991). Chronic food shortages have their effect by creating\na small mother, which imposes ‘maternal uterine con-\nstraint’ on the fetus probably mediated through a complex\ninterplay between insulin-like growth factors and their\nbinding proteins (Kelsey et al. 1999). These constraints\nthe fetus does not outgrow the\nattempt\nmother’s capacity to carry it safely to term and to deliver it\nnaturally. Such growth-restricted babies may be ‘small but\nperfectly formed’, and it\nto assume that\nthey necessarily carry the same perinatal risks as a low-\nbirth-weight baby of a much larger mother (Wilcox, 2001;\nMelve & Skjaerven, 2003). They may be thought of as\nhaving a harmonious growth well adapted for their uterine\nenvironment. Since the uterine environment\nis itself a\nreﬂection of the historic dietary conditions of the family,\nthe baby can be viewed as well adapted to its recent\nhistory, and hence to its best available prediction of likely\nfuture circumstances.\nto ensure that\nis incorrect\nProblems arise when this harmony of growth is\ndisrupted. The best documented evidence of this dishar-\nmony comes from collaborative studies between Ranjan\nYajnik and colleagues in Pune, India and Caroline Fall and\ncolleagues in Southampton, UK (Bavdekar et al. 1999;\nYajnik, 2000; Yajnik et al. 2002a,b). They have demon-\nstrated a phenomenon that Yajnik (Yajnik et al. 2002a,b)\ndescribes as the ‘thin–fat’ baby syndrome (Prentice, 2003).\nThe Indian mothers are small but carry a disproportion-\nately high level of abdominal fat. Comparison between\nthe Indian and Southampton babies reﬂects a similar\npicture, with the Indian babies being much smaller than\ntheir UK counterparts in all dimensions except triceps and\nespecially subscapular skinfolds, suggesting that they are\nrelatively fat. Raised glucose and insulin levels are already\npresent in the cord blood of the Indian babies (Yajnik et al.\n2002b) and studies later in childhood also reveal early\nevidence of insulin resistance (Bavdekar et al. 1999;\nYajnik, 2000). There are several possible interpretations of\nthese data, including the possibility that the relative fatness\nof\nIndian mothers has induced an altered\n‘disharmonious’ pattern of tissue deposition in the fetus\nthat already carries detectable metabolic penalties.\nthe small\nin view of\nPostnatal inﬂuences have so far attracted less interest in\nthe developmental origins of health and adult disease ﬁeld\nthan prenatal inﬂuences. However, they are now beginning\nthe\nto receive much greater attention,\nit may be the accelerated catch-up\ndemonstrations that\ngrowth of some small babies that\nis most strongly\ncorrelated with later ill-health outcomes (Lucas et al.\n1999; Forse´n et al. 2000).\nIn the developing world\ndeviations in postnatal growth all\ntend to be in the\ndownwards direction and, by analogy with the speculations\nabout impaired fetal growth, might also create a disadapted\nphenotype if such children grow up into conditions of\nnutrient surfeit. Using data from rural Gambians it has\nagain been demonstrated that there is an absence of any\nimportant risk factors for CVD or diabetes in adults who\nwere malnourished as children but still live their traditional\nlifestyle (Moore et al. 2001). This ﬁnding\nfrugal rural\nholds true even in the lowest quartile of childhood\nnutritional status, for which the mean weight-for-age Z-\nscore is worse than –3.3. Such ﬁndings do not necessarily\nchallenge the developmental origins of health and adult\ndisease thesis, but do emphasise the need for datasets in\nwhich early malnutrition has been followed by later\nafﬂuence as part of a rapid demographic transition. Until\nsuch data are obtained, much of the current prediction that\nthe\nrapidly-developing nations will bear\ndevelopmental origins of health and adult disease thesis\nremains speculative.\nthe brunt of\nThrifty genotypes\nNeel (1962) at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis,\nMN, USA) coined the term ‘thrifty genotype’ in a paper\nentitled: Diabetes mellitus: a ‘thrifty’ genotype rendered\ndetrimental by ‘progress’. This phrase has become one of\nthose that are sufﬁciently catchy and self-explanatory to have\nentered the lexicon and achieved wide currency in both lay\nand scientiﬁc writing. In doing so it has gathered a cloak of\nmisuse that hampers constructive discussion of its possible\nrelevance in understanding the current susceptibility to\nobesity. An attempt will be made to deconstruct some of\nthis casual usage in order to try and deﬁne it better as a\ntheoretical construct. In attempting to do so it is recognised\nthat it may be deprived of one of its major attributes, i.e. a\nﬂexibility that has been part of its usefulness.\nGeneralisability of the thrifty genotype concept\nThe disciples of the original thesis of Neel (1962) have\nit could explain the very high\nfrequently argued that\nIt\nis argued that\nprevalence of obesity and diabetes within some isolated\npopulations, particularly on Polynesian islands (West,\n1974; Joffe & Zimmet, 1998).\nthe\nhighly-susceptible islanders are the descendants of a few\nfounders who had been selected as the survivors of a long\nsea crossing in which their less-thrifty shipmates died of\nhunger.

         "The outcome of mycobacterial infections is thought to\nbe  critically  dependent  on  the  nonopsonic  invasion  and\ncolonization of macrophages during primary infection of\ninhaled bacteria. This is why the initial step of mycobacte-\nria phagocytosis by macrophages received considerable at-\ntention, including efforts to delineate the molecular mech-\nanisms that underlie this process.\nNonopsonic  internalization  of  mycobacteria  in  macro-\nphages  can  be  mediated  by  different  kinds  of  receptors\nthat speciﬁcally recognize ligands expressed at the surface\nof bacilli (1, 2). Glycophosphoinositol-anchored receptors\nsuch as CD14 (3, 4), scavenger receptor (5), and transfer-\nrin receptor (6, 7) have been suggested as putative routes\nof entry for mycobacteria into macrophages. Additionally,\ncomplement  receptor  3  (CR3)  (8–10)  and  mannose  re-\nceptor (MR) (8, 11) are both well-known receptors for the\nbinding  and  internalization  of  mycobacteria  in  macro-\nphages.  Both  receptors  exhibited  lectin-like  properties.\nIndeed, MR is a monomeric transmembrane protein with\nan  extracellular  domain  containing  eight  carbohydrate\nrecognition  domains  with  C-type  lectin  properties  that\nrecognize mannose, fucose, and\n-acetylglucosamine resi-\ndues present on the cell surface of pathogens, such as my-\ncobacteria  (12–14).  CR3  is  a  heterodimeric  type  1  trans-\nmembrane  glycoprotein  consisting  of  a  CD18\nsubunit\nnoncovalently associated with the CD11b\nchain. The ex-\ntracellular portion of CD11b contained distinct functional\nbinding domains. One of these, called the I domain, is es-\nsential for the recognition and internalization of C3bi op-\nN\nsonized  particles  (15,  16).  Another  one,  located  on  the\ncarboxyl-terminal  end  of  the  extracellular  portion  of\nCD11b, is a nonopsonic binding site with lectin properties\n(17). This latter domain is mainly involved in phagocytosis\nof  particles  containing\n-glucan,  such  as  zymosan  (18),\nbut also interacts with mannose, glucose, and\n-glu-\ncosamine (17). More recently, a second nonopsonic bind-\ning  domain  distinct  from  the  lectin  one  has  been  pro-\nposed to bind and internalize mycobacteria (19).\n-acetyl-\nN\nd\ns\nmegmatis\nWe  recently  demonstrated  that  mycobacteria  express\nmolecules at their surface that play a role in their internal-\nization  by  human  macrophages  (20).  Using  a  biological\ntest  of  phagocytosis  inhibition,  we  found  that  lipids,  but\nnot proteins, isolated from the outermost layer of\nMycobac-\nterium\nby  a  mechanical  treatment  decrease  the\nnonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human mac-\nrophages without affecting the internalization of particles\nsuch as zymosan or latex beads (20). A detailed analysis of\nthe lipid fractions has indicated that the major inhibitory\ncompounds  belong  to  the  glycopeptidolipid  (GPL)  and\nphospholipid  families  (20).  When  the  former  family  was\nFig. 1\nchemically  and  structurally  analyzed,  several  inhibitory\nC-type GPLs were identiﬁed, among which a novel class of\nsuccinylated GPLs (\n) passed unnoticed until now (20).\nWe  have  also  proposed  that  their  capacity  to  inhibit  the\nphagocytosis  of  mycobacteria  is  dependent  on  common\nstructural features. Identiﬁcation of these molecules and\ntheir  putative  role  as  surface-exposed  ligands  of  phago-\ncytic receptors would help us understand the host-patho-\ngen interactions at the molecular level. The present study\nwas  designed  ﬁrst  to  identify  the  mycobacteria  surface-\nexposed  phospholipids  that  play  a  role  in  their  internal-\nization  by  human  macrophages  and  second  to  examine\nthe roles of GPLs and phospholipids as potential ligands\nof phagocytic receptors.\nReagents and antibodies\nMycobacteria\nExtraction and puriﬁcation of glycolipids\nMass spectrometry\nHuman MDM\nCoating of latex beads\nInfection of adherent macrophages and\nphagocytosis assay\nStatistics\nInhibitory activity of surface-exposed phospholipids on\nthe phagocytosis of\nM. smegmatis\nFig. 2\nand PIM\nM. smegmatis\nIn the present study, we ﬁrst attempted to identify the\nsurface-exposed phospholipids implicated in the internal-\nization  of  mycobacteria.  For  this  purpose,  lipid  extract\nfrom\nwas ﬁrst enriched in phospholipids by\nmethanol precipitation. As depicted in\n, the metha-\nnol-insoluble fraction, analyzed by TLC, contained several\ncompounds: PIMs, in particular PIM\n(Fig. 1) as\nthe  main  subspecies,  PI  (Fig.  2A),  PG  (Fig.  2B),  and  PE\n(Fig. 2B). Examination of the blocking effect of the meth-\nanol-insoluble fraction on phagocytosis was the approach\nchosen  to  determine  the  role  of  phospholipids  in  the\nphagocytic process of mycobacteria. MDM were pretreated\nfor 15 min with the phospholipid-enriched extract at con-\ncentrations  ranging  from  10  pg  to  100\ng  lipid/ml  and\nthen put into contact with\nfor 45 min. At the\nlowest tested concentration (i.e., 10 pg lipid/ml), treated\nand untreated macrophages equally internalized\nM. smeg-\nmatis\n2). In con-\ntrast, increasing lipid concentration to 10 ng/ml resulted\nin a 30% decrease in the uptake of\nM. smegmatis\n6% to 45\n2).

These  data  strongly  sug-\ngested  that  the  observed  inhibitory  activity  of  the  phos-\npholipid-rich  methanol-insoluble  fraction  was  essentially\nattributable  to  PIM.  This  hypothesis  was  further  con-\nﬁrmed using PIM-enriched fractions obtained from a\nM.\nsmegmatis\nlipid  extract  as  follows:  methanol-insoluble  lip-\nids  were  fractionated  by  ion-exchange  chromatography\ninto 14 fractions eluted with increasing concentrations of\nammonium  acetate  in  chloroform-methanol.  TLC  and\nMALDI-TOF analysis showed that the ﬁrst 8 fractions con-\ntained  traces,  if  any,  of  phospholipids  (data  not  shown),\nwhereas  fractions  9–14  contained  essentially  PIM  and  PI\nFig. 3A\n(\n). Therefore, these last six fractions were tested on\nphagocytosis of\nat 10 ng lipid/ml, the low-\nest active concentration for the phospholipid mixture. As\nshown in Fig. 3B, the tested fractions exhibited an inhibi-\ntory  effect  of\n50%.  This  set  of  experiments  indicated\nthat PIMs were the compounds responsible for the activity\nof  the  phospholipid  mixture  and  therefore  were  the  es-\nsential  phospholipids  involved  in  the  phagocytic  process\nof mycobacteria.\nM. smegmatis\nPIM\n(Ac\nM. bovis\nand PIM\nsubfamilies\nM. smegmatis\n(27).

However,  we  failed  to\nproperly separate PIM\nby the puriﬁcation pro-\nfrom PIM\ntocol  used.  This  prompted  us  to  use  puriﬁed  PIM\nand\nPIM\nBCG by Gilleron\net al. (24), which are structurally identical to those of\nM.\nsmegmatis\nand\nPIM\n.\nM.  smegmatis\nTheir inhibitory activity increased from 100 pg to 10 ng of\nlipid per milliliter, PIM\nbeing slightly more efﬁcient than\nPIM\n. A plateau of inhibition was then reached at 10 ng/\nml up to 10\nand PIM\ng/ml. Importantly, 10 ng/ml PIM\nsubfamilies did not affect zymosan internalization, used as\na control of phagocytic process (33\n11%,\nrespectively,  vs.  35\n3  and  4),  indicating  a\nspeciﬁc  inhibition  of  the  MDM-particle  interactions  by\nstructurally  deﬁned  molecules.  We  then  addressed  the\nquestion  of  whether  PIM\ninterfered  with  the\nphagocytosis  of  the  pathogenic  mycobacteria  (e.g.,\nM.\navium\n). When tested at 10 ng/ml, both\ncompounds  reduced  the  internalization  of  bacteria  (Fig.\n4B).

Nevertheless, these observations clearly demon-\nstrated that subfamilies of PIM are involved in the nonop-\nsonic phagocytic process of mycobacteria.\nRecognition of PIM and GPL by nonopsonic\nphagocytic receptors\nRecently,  we  reported  that  subfamilies  of  another  sur-\n,  GPL  (Fig.1),  in-\nface-exposed  glycolipid  of\nM.  smegmatis\nhibit the phagocytosis of mycobacteria (20). We have also\ndemonstrated  that  the  nonopsonic  phagocytosis  of  both\npathogenic  and  nonpathogenic  mycobacteria  by  human\nphagocytes is mediated at least in part by two major recep-\ntors, CR3 and MR (11, 29). Therefore, the ability of PIM\nand GPL to inhibit mycobacteria internalization by block-\ning their entry through these receptors was suspected and\ninvestigated. To this aim, latex beads were coated with pu-\nriﬁed PIM or GPL using the method previously described\nby  Schlesinger,  Hull,  and  Kaufman  (26).  As  PIM\nand\ntween the internalization of PIM - or GPL- and BSA-coated\nbeads (data not shown). As expected, pretreatment of MDM\nwith 2LPM (5 g/ml) for 30 min at 37C signiﬁcantly de-\ncreased  the  internalization  of  serum-opsonized  and  non-\nopsonized zymosan but did not affect the phagocytosis of\nBSA-coated beads (Fig. 5A). Such pretreatment also reduced\nby approximately one-third the entry of both GPL III- and\nPIM -coated beads but not that of GPL I (Fig. 5A), indicat-\ning  that  entry  of  PIM -  and  GPL  III-coated  beads,  but  not\nthat of beads coated with GPL I, involves CR3.\nPIM  displayed comparable activities on the phagocytosis\nof  mycobacteria,  PIM ,  the  quantitatively  major  constitu-\nent of PIM, was isolated from M. bovis BCG and used for\nthe  subsequent  experiment  as  representative  of  the  PIM\nfamily. Beads were also coated with either GPL III or GPL I\nfrom M. smegmatis, two classes of GPL that have been shown\nto exhibit different inhibitory activities on MDM (20).\nThe capacity of the coated beads to enter macrophages\nthrough MR or CR3 was then investigated using a compe-\ntition approach with blocking antibodies directed against\nreceptors or soluble ligands. Monoclonal antibody 2LPM\nwas selected for its capacity to prevent both opsonic and\nnonopsonic internalization through CR3 (19, 30, 31). Se-\nrum-opsonized  and  nonopsonized  zymosan  were  used  as\npositive CR3 binding particles (19) and BSA-latex beads as\na negative control. We did not observe any difference be-\nThe entry of beads through the MR was also evaluated\nusing a competitive ligand, Man-BSA (11), or a goat anti-\nhuman  MR  antiserum  selected  for  its  capacity  to  block\nMR-dependent  functions  (32,  33).  Man-BSA-  and  BSA-\ncoated latex beads were used as positive and negative con-\ntrols of MR-dependent phagocytosis, respectively (11). In\nthis  set  of  experiments,  GPL  III-coated  beads  were  inter-\nnalized as efﬁciently as beads coated with Man-BSA (45 \n5% vs. 33  7%; n  3), whereas PIM -coated beads were\nslightly better internalized (58  1% vs. 33  7%; n  3).\nAs  expected,  pretreatment  of  MDM  with  anti-MR  antise-\nrum (1:50) or 300 g/ml Man-BSA for 30 min at 37C dra-\nmatically  reduced  the  internalization  of  Man-BSA-coated\nbeads  (Fig.  5B).  Such  pretreatments  did  not  affect  the\nphagocytosis of either GPL I- or PIM -coated beads. In con-\ntrast,  both  treatments  slightly  but  signiﬁcantly  decreased\nthe  phagocytosis of GPL III-coated beads  (Fig.  5B), indi-\ncating that only GPL III-coated beads enter MDM through\nthe MR. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both\nPIM  and GPL III participate to the internalization of my-\ncobacteria and thereby are potential ligands of phagocytic\nreceptors expressed at the surface of MDM.\nThe  outermost  cell  envelope  layer,  also  called  a  cap-\nsule in the case of pathogenic mycobacteria, represents a\nprivileged interface between mycobacteria and host cells.\nSome  of  its  components,  such  as  glucan  (34)  and  GPL\n(20),  have  been  implicated  in  the  interaction  with  mac-\nrophages. Other constituents of the mycobacterial cell en-\nvelope  have  also  been  shown  to  induce  various  host  cell\nresponses (35), but their localization at the cell surface is\nstill a matter of debate. We show here that the outermost\nlayer  of  M.  smegmatis  contained  PIMs  that  also  partici-\npate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria. The\nPIMs, described by Ballou and colleagues (36) in the 1960s,\nare  based  on  PI  and  are  formed  of  one  to  six  mannosyl\nresidues  attached  to  the  inositol  moiety  of  the  phospho-\nlipid. The PIMs usually occur as a mixture of compounds\ndiffering  from  one  another  by  the  number  of  mannosyl\nresidues and fatty acyl groups. The nonpathogenic strain\nM.  smegmatis  ATCC  607  has  been  described  to  contain\nmainly  two  PIM  subfamilies,  PIM   and  PIM   (24,  27),  in\nagreement  with  the  composition  of  the  crude  PIM  frac-\ntions reported herein.\nAlthough other forms of PIM have been reported in the\nliterature (24), they were undetectable under our experi-\nmental  conditions,  probably  because  they  occur  in  too\nsmall quantities. Therefore, the crude PIM-dependent in-\nhibition  of  mycobacterial  phagocytosis  was  essentially  at-\ntributable to PIM  and PIM . This was further conﬁrmed\nusing enriched PIM  and PIM  fractions isolated from M.\nbovis  BCG.  Nanomolar  concentrations  of  PIM  decreased\nthe internalization of M. smegmatis by MDM, whereas much\nhigher concentrations of lipids were required to affect M.\navium  or  M.  tuberculosis  phagocytosis  to  the  same  extent.\nPIMs  are  found  on  the  bacterial  surface  of  both  patho-\ngenic  and  nonpathogenic  mycobacteria  (27,  37).  How-\never, there are strain differences in the surface exposure\nof  PIMs  that  are  inversely  correlated  with  the  abundant\nexpression of capsular polysaccharides composed of -glu-\ncan that can partially mask capsular PIM and directly act\non  phagocytic  receptor,  such  as  CR3  (30).  If  we  assume\nthat PIMs, exposed at the surface of M. smegmatis, have a\nlower afﬁnity for the phagocytic receptors than the outer-\nmost polysaccharides of pathogenic species (38), this may\nexplain why different PIM concentrations are required to\ninhibit  to  a  comparable  extent  the  phagocytosis  of  M.\nsmegmatis and M. avium or M. tuberculosis.\nIt has to be noted that the occurrence of a carbohydrate\nportion on phospholipid is critical for the inhibitory activ-\nity, because PI displayed no effect but PIM  did. However,\nsurprisingly,  the  length  of  the  oligomannosyl  chain  does\nnot appear to be important for the activity, because PIM\nand PIM  equally inhibited phagocytosis. Previous studies\nhave  reported  that  soya  PI  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  myco-\nbacterial PI inhibited the nonopsonic binding of M. tuber-\nculosis to murine macrophages (39, 40). This is in apparent\nconﬂict with the data presented here. Such a discrepancy\ncould  be  attributed  to  interspecies  differences  in  the\nPI  mode  of  action  between  murine  and  human  macro-\nphages. Our data, together with our previous report (20),\ncollectively  indicate  that  surface-exposed  PIM  and  GPL\nparticipate in the internalization of mycobacteria by mac-\nrophages and, as such, are potential ligands of phagocytic\nreceptors.  It  is  possible,  however,  that  other  constituents\nof  the  mycobacterial  envelope,  such  as  glucan  and  un-\nidentiﬁed molecules, could also be involved in the interac-\ntions of bacilli with macrophages, as illustrated by the vari-\nety of routes of entry of mycobacteria into host cells.\nThe  molecular  mechanisms  by  which  surface-exposed\nGPLs  and  PIMs  participate  in  the  phagocytosis  of  myco-\nbacteria deserve consideration. PIMs have been proposed\nto  participate  in  the  receptor-mediated  uptake  of  myco-\nbacteria (26, 41). For instance, they have been  shown to\nact  as  an  adhesin,  allowing  the  binding  of  M.  tuberculosis\nand  M.  smegmatis  to  hamster  ovary  ﬁbroblasts,  either  di-\nrectly or after opsonization with mannose binding protein\n(41). Here, we demonstrate that coating latex beads with\nPIM   favors  their  internalization  through  a  CR3-depen-\ndent process, probably through the lectin binding site of\nCR3, which might recognize the mannosyl moiety of PIM,\nas mentioned above. Like other mannosylated conjugates,\nPIMs have been suspected to be ligands of the MR. We ad-\ndressed  this  question  and  show,  for  the  ﬁrst  time,  that\nPIMs, at least PIM , do not in fact interact with this recep-\ntor in our cell model. As mentioned above, the length of\nthe  oligomannosyl  chain  was  not  critical  for  PIM  inhibi-\ntion of phagocytosis, suggesting that PIM  was not a part-\nner of MR. The mode of action of GPL as a putative ligand\nof  macrophages  has  been  poorly  investigated.  We  found\nthat  GPL  III  ensures  the  entry  of  particles  through  both\nCR3 and MR. Although all types of GPLs share the same\npeptidolipid core, GPL I, which is inactive, lacks the succi-\nnyl  substituent  that  occurs  in  GPL  III  and  is  3,4-O-acety-\nlated on the 6-deoxytalosyl moiety (",

Introduction\nMany believe that software vendors typically follow the policy of ‘sell today and fix it\ntomorrow’;  or  ‘I’d  rather  have  it  wrong  than  have  it  late’  (Paulk  et  al  1994;  Arora,\nCaulkins,  Telang  2004)  for  launching  software  products  in  the  market.  This  policy,\ndictated by the need to launch products quickly before competitors, seemed to work in the\npast because software errors which escape detection during pre-launch testing appear very\ninfrequently  in  normal  operations  (once  every  ‘5000’  years,  as  per  Adams,  1980).\nHowever,  Adams’  ‘5000-year  error’  theory  might  not  hold  in  the  internet  age  because\nhundreds  (if  not  thousands)  of  people  are  looking  for  flaws  in  other  vendors  software\nproducts,  drastically  increasing  the  chances  that  a  flaw  will  be  exposed.  Various  people\nsuch  as  hackers,  independent  security  firms  and  academic  researchers  are  interested  in\nfinding  flaws  in  other  vendors’  software  for  different  reasons.  Not  only  are  security\nsoftware products such as firewalls at risk, but software like operating systems, enterprise\nsoftware and database software also contain flaws which can be exploited to create security\nrelated attacks.\nThe  Organization  of  Internet  Safety  (OIS)  (www.oisafety.org)  defines  security\nvulnerability as : “security vulnerability is a flaw within a software system that can cause it\nto work contrary to its documented design and could be exploited to cause the system to\nviolate  its  documented  security  policy”.  Software  vulnerabilities  have  widespread  impact\nand can potentially cause billions of dollars in downtime and disruptions to firms (In this\npaper, the word ‘firms’ refers to companies which use software products; ‘vendors’ refers\nto  companies  which  develop  the  software  products).  A  study  by  NIST  in  2002  estimates\nthe cost of faulty software at $60 bn per year. Incidents like the Code Red virus (in 2001)\nand  the  Melissa  virus  (in  1999)  occurred  when  hackers  exploited  flaws  in  software.  The\ndamage  due  to  Code  Red  was  estimated  at  $2.1  bn  and  due  to  Melissa  at  $1.1bn .  The\nGartner  Group  estimates  that  the  system  downtime  caused  by  security  vulnerabilities\nwould triple from 5% of the total downtime in 2004 to 15% of the total downtime in 2008.\nIn  2003,  Computer  Emergency  Response  Team  (CERT)  reported  around  250,000  self\nreported incidences of system breaches, most of which exploit vulnerabilities in software\ncode  (Applewhite  2004).  Microsoft’s  $200m  campaign  for  .NET  was  marred  by  the\ndiscovery of a security flaw in Visual C++ .NET barely a month after Microsoft Chairman\nBill  Gates  directed  employees  to  focus  on  building  more  secure  software  (dubbed  the\n‘Trustworthy Computing’ initiative). Moreover, vulnerability disclosure is finding its way\ninto  firms’  strategy  toolkits  as  it  evident  from  a  WSJ  report  in  Feb  2004  that  software\nvendors are spending time and effort in discovering flaws in their rivals’ software products\nin  order  to  influence  the  rivals’  stock  prices.  For  example,  security  software  vendor  IDS\nreleased a vulnerability alert on rival Checkpoint’s firewall software on the day Checkpoint\nusually  holds  its  annual  US  investor  conference.  Some  examples  of  vulnerability\nannouncements reported in popular press are:\n•  News.com(04/25/2000)  “A  computer  security\nfirm  has  discovered  a  serious\nvulnerability  in  Red  Hat’s  newest  version  of  Linux  that  could  let  attackers  destroy  or\ndeface a Web site  - or possibly even take over the machine itself……..”\n•  WSJ(02/11/2004) “Microsoft Corp. warned customers about serious security problems\nwith  its  Windows  software  that  let  hackers  quietly  break  into  their  computers  to  steal\nfiles, delete data or eavesdrop on sensitive information……..”\nInspite  of  all  these  concerns  about  software  vulnerabilities,  not  much  has  been\nmentioned  in  literature  about  the  incentive  of  software  vendors  to  invest  in  defect-free\nsoftware. Literature on software risks fails to include any measure for security related risks\n(Wallace, Keil and Rai, 2004; Barki, Rivard and Talbot, 1993). The closest literature to the\ntopic of security vulnerabilities is that on software quality (Basili and Musa, 1991; Harter,\nKrishnan  and  Slaughter,  2000).  However,  in  traditional  literature,  quality  is  measured  in\nterms  of  reliability  and  integrity  of  the  source  code  –  which  essentially  tests  software\nagainst specified streams of input from users. However, in today’s internet age, software\ndesigners  must  not  only  think  of  users,  but  also  malicious  adversaries  (Devanbu  and\nStubblebine,  2000).  Some  quality  models  such  as  ISO9126  fail  to  include  computer\nsecurity  (Pfleegar  1997).  Therefore  software  which  has  been  certified  as  high  quality,\nbased  on  existing  definitions  of  software  quality,  can  have  many  security  flaws.\nResearchers in computer science are working on better integration of the two disciplines of\nsoftware  quality  and  software  security  while  designing  software  (Carr,  Tynan  and  Davis\n1991, Wang and Wang, 2003; McGraw 2004).\nSo far, there has only been anecdotal evidence that software vulnerabilities are causing\nvendors to lose market value. For example, the Wall Street Journal (11/09/2004) reported\nthat Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) is losing market share in the web browser market to\ncompetitors like Mozilla’s Firefox, due to numerous flaws discovered in IE. For example,\nnearly  8  million  people  have  downloaded  the  Firefox  browser  between  September-\nNovember 2004. While the damage that firms suffer as a result of security breaches can be\nmeasured  in  terms  of  downtime  and  maintenance  activity,  the  cost  implication  of\nvulnerability disclosures on the software vendors is neither clear nor well studied.  This is\nthe major goal of this paper. Using an event study methodology, we estimate how the stock\nprice of the software vendors is affected when vulnerability information in their products is\npublished in popular press.\nPrior  literature  on  product  defects  (Jarrell  and  Peltzman  1985)  predicts  that  product\nrecall announcements in drug and auto industries are associated with loss in market value\nof a firm. Davidson and Worrell (1992) confirm the negative impact of product defects on\nstock prices in non-auto industries and also analyze the impact of different types of recall\n(e.g.  total  product  recall  versus  a  recall  for  repair;  government  ordered  recall  versus\nvoluntary recall). However the results of these prior studies on product defects cannot be\ndirectly  applied  to  the  software  industry  because  of  the  following  characteristics  of\nsoftware products: One, software products generally come with a click-wrap agreement (or\nEULA  –  End  User  License  Agreement)  which  limits  the  vendors’  liability.  Two,  the\ngeneral philosophy held by software vendors, software customers and the US courts is that\nsoftware is a uniquely complex product that will probably have some defects (Cusumano\n2004).  Therefore  it  is  not  clear  whether  markets  will  react  adversely  to  the  news  of  a\nsoftware  vulnerability;  because  over  the  long  run,  markets  will  anticipate  the  effect  of  a\nvulnerability announcements on cash flows of software vendors, so the impact of a specific\nannouncement  might  not  be  significant.  Three, software vulnerability announcements are\ngenerally  accompanied  with  a  remedial  patch  which  potentially  protects  customers  from\nmalicious  exploits.  Hence,  the  market  may  not  behave  adversely  towards  a  vendor  if  it\nreleases  a  patch  along-with  the  vulnerability  announcement.    Finally,  vulnerability\nannouncements  are  directly  related  to  the  installed  base  of  a  software  product.  Popular\nsoftware like those from Microsoft are constantly subject to malicious and non-malicious\nattacks  and  as  such  have  a  greater  proportion  of  flaws  reported  in  them  as  compared  to\nsoftware by Apple, where the user base is comparatively smaller. Therefore, the presence\nof  vulnerabilities  may  not  always  signal  a  lower  quality  product;  it  may  in-fact  signal\nsuperiority  over  competition.  E.g.  John  Thomson,  CEO  of  Symantec,  predicts  that  the\nflaws  in  Linux  will  likely  increase  as  the  installed  base  increases.  In  view  of  these\narguments, it would be interesting to understand whether and how the market responds to\nvulnerability disclosures in software products.\nMotivated  by  these  observations,  in  this  research  we  try  to  quantify  the  losses  that\nsoftware  vendors  bear  when  a  vulnerability  is  disclosed  in  their  product.  The  main\nquestions that we seek to answer are:\n1.  What  is  the  impact  of  vulnerability  disclosures  on  the  market  value  of  a  software\nvendor?\n2.  How do the characteristics of the vulnerability impact this change in market value?\nOur  research  has  important  policy  implications  in  terms  of  understanding  vendors’\nincentive to improve pre- and post-launch quality of their software products.  While there\nis lot of hype surrounding the poor quality dished out by software vendors, their incentives\nto provide more secure software is still unclear. If we indeed find that the market is willing\nto  punish  vulnerability  announcements  because  it  perceives  these  announcements  as  a\nsignal of poor quality software which either increase vendor costs to fix them or erode their\nmarket share in the long run, then our research provides a direct evidence of incentives to\nprovide  more  secure  software.  Vulnerabilities  are  disclosed  by  vendors  or  by  third\nparty/competitors  with  or  without  a  patch.  Since  we  measure  if  there  are  significant\ndifferences in market reaction to such disclosures, our paper provides policy guidelines to\nvendors about whether and how they may disclose the information themselves. Moreover,\nthis  also  provides  evidence  on  what  is  the  value  of  patches  when  vulnerabilities  are\ndisclosed.  Finally,  we  also  examine  how  vulnerability  characteristics,  effect  of  9/11  etc\naffect the market reaction.\nUsing  an  event-study  approach,  we  collect  data  on  about  146  vulnerability  disclosure\nannouncements over the period of over 5 years for 18 publicly traded vendors. Our results\nconfirm  that  vulnerability  disclosure  adversely  and  significantly  affects  the  stock\nperformance  of  a  software  vendor.  We  show  that,  on  average,  a  software  vendor  loses\naround  0.63%  of  market  value  on  the  day  of  the  vulnerability  announcement.  This\ntranslates  to  a  dollar  amount  of  $0.86  bn  loss  in  market  value.  We  also  find  that\nvulnerabilities  where  the  vendor  fails  to  provide  a  patch  at  the  time  of  disclosure  yield\nmore negative returns than when the vendor discloses a patch. On average, a vendor loses\n0.8% more in market value when a patch is not available. This provides evidence as to why\nvendors are trying to push for legalizing the limited disclosure norms. We also show that\nvulnerabilities  which  create  confidentiality  related  breaches  result  in  a  greater  loss  than\nvulnerabilities  which  create  non-confidentiality  related  breaches.  For  example,  vendors\nlose  0.75%  less  in  market  value  when  the  vulnerability  can  lead  to  a  non-confidentiality\nrelated breach than when it can lead to a confidentiality related breach. We also find that\nmore severe software vulnerabilities result in a greater loss in market value than less severe\nvulnerabilities.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, section 2, we provide\na literature review. We develop our hypotheses in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the\nmethodology of data collection and also describe the event study methodology. In Section\n5, we present our results using multivariate regression analysis and test various hypothesis\nrelated  to  how  the  vulnerability  characteristics  effect  the  change  in  stock  prices.  Finally,\nwe present the concluding remarks in Section 6.\n2. Literature Review\nMost  prior  research  on  information  security  discusses  the  economics  of  such\ninvestments from a customer perspective, rather than from a software vendor perspective\n(Anderson  2001).  Gordon  and  Loeb  (2002)  show  that  firms  should  make  investments  in\ninformation  security  far  less  than  the  expected  loss  from  a  security  breach.  Gordon  et  al\n(2002),  Gal-Or  and  Ghose  (2003)  discuss  the  economics  of  information  sharing  among\nfirms  on  security  related  issues.  Prior  event  study  analyses  on  information  security  have\nfocused on the change in market value of firms whose systems are breached (Cavusoglu et\nal (2004) and Kannan, Rees and Sridhar (2004)). These studies show that announcements\nof  a  security  breach  negatively  impact  the CAR  (Cumulative  Abnormal  Return)  of  firms\nwhose information systems have been breached. Campbell et al (2003) conduct a similar\nevent  study  and  find  that  only  the  impact  of  confidentiality  related  security  breaches  is\nnegative and significant; the impact of non-confidentiality related security breaches is not\nsignificantly  different  from  zero.    Hovav  and  D’Arcy  (2003)  show  similar  results  by\nfinding  that  Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  type  attacks  are  not  associated  with  any  significant\nloss in value for firms .\nDisclosure of vulnerabilities has been one contentious area. Typically, a major portion\nof the vulnerabilities is reported by benign independent security analysts (ISA). Since no\nlegal  guidelines  exists  which  dictate  how  vulnerabilities  should  be  handled  by  the\ndiscoverer,  some ISAs report the vulnerability to the vendor and give it sufficient time to\ncome  up  with  a  patch  (The  OIS  recommends  a  time  period  of  30  days  to  be  given  to\nvendors  to  come  up  with  a  patch).  However,  some  other  ISAs  follow  the  policy  of  full\ndisclosure, i.e. they immediately post the vulnerability to a public listing like Bugtraq. One\nmajor goal of full disclosure is to eventually force vendors to come up with more secure\nsoftware.  The  debate  on  disclosure  policies  can  be  summarized  by  the  following  quotes\n(Applewhite  2000):  Jennifer  Granick  of  Stanford  University  defends  full  disclosure  as\n“You  want  a  free  flow  of  information,  just  like  in  other  scientific  fields,  ideally  without\nbetraying important interests.” Scott Blake of OIS opposes full disclosure as, “As soon as\nyou  tell  one  person,  you  have  tipped  the  balance  and  people  will  begin  producing\nexploits.”  Some  recent  academic  work  is  examining  this  issue  more  formally.  Arora,\nTelang and Xu (2004) study the optimal timing of vulnerability disclosure and show how\ndisclosure can force vendors to release patches quickly. Kannan and Telang (2004) explore\nthe welfare implications of a market mechanism for software vulnerabilities and report that\na market based mechanism for software vulnerabilities always underperforms a CERT-type\nmechanism.\nHowever  none  of  these  studies  measures  the  impact  of  disclosure  on  vendor’s  market\nvalue or profitability. While one major goal of full disclosure is to eventually force vendors\nto develop secure software, empirically, there is no evidence that suggests that disclosure\nindeed  creates  such  incentives.  Our  paper  provides  an  understanding  of  whether  such\ndisclosures create incentives for the vendors to produce secure software in the first place.\nOur  methodology  follows  closely  from  prior  event  study  analysis.  Campbell  et  al\n(1997)  present  a  useful  summary  of  the  event  study  analysis  highlighting  the  history  as\nwell  as  the  commonly  followed  methodologies.  Event  study  methodologies  are  well\naccepted for studying the implications of public announcements on stock prices. Hendricks\nand  Singhal  (1996)  study  the  impact  of  quality  award  winning  announcements  on  the\nmarket  value  of  firms  and  observe  positive  abnormal  returns  generated  by  winning  a\nquality  award.  They  further  note  that  awards  given  by  independent  organizations  and\nannouncements by small firms are more likely to have a significant impact on the firms’\nmarket  value.  In  the  field  of  Information  Systems,  Subramani  and  Walden  (2001)  used\nevent study analyses to show that e-commerce announcements lead to significant increases\nin the stock price of firms. Chatterjee, Richardson and Zmud (2001) examine the influence\nof  newly  announced  CIO  positions  on  shareholder  wealth.  Im,  Dow  and  Grover  (2001)\nexamine  the  changes  in  market  value  of  a  firm  in  response  to  IT  investment\nannouncements. Bharadwaj and Keil (2003) investigate the impact of IT failures on firms’\nmarket value.\nThe  main  contribution  of  this  research  is  that  this  is  one  of  the  first  comprehensive\nstudies,  to  our  knowledge,  that  has  tried  to  measure  the  impact  of  vulnerabilities  on\nsoftware  vendors.  Thus,  we  extend  prior  literature  on  product  defects  and  confirm  that\nsoftware  vendors  too  suffer  a  loss  in  market  value  when  a  flaw  is  discovered  in  their\nproduct.  This  is  inspite  of  the  fact  that  software  vulnerabilities  are  prevalent  among\nsoftware of almost all major vendors and that vendors face no legal liability if clients suffer\nlosses  due  to  the  software  flaw.  As  we  noted  in  the  introduction  that  this  has  important\nimplications in terms of vendors making investment in software quality as well as policy\nand legal issues which govern vulnerability disclosures.\n3. Hypotheses\nMuch of the prior literature on product defects (Jarrell and Peltzman (1985), Davidson\nand Worrell (1992)) shows that generally defective product and recall announcements are\nassociated  with  loss  in  market  value  of  a  firm.  Banker  and  Slaughter  (1998)  find  that\nunplanned and critical maintenance activities increase software maintenance costs.  Thus,\nfixing  bugs  entails  cost  to  firms.  For  example,  the  security  fixes  may  cost  about  $2000-\n$9000 when done during testing phase. However, they may cost more than 4-8 times when\nfixed after the application has been shipped.  Slaughter et al (1998) and Westland (2003)\nsuggest  that  software  defects  are  harder  and  costlier  to  fix  if  discovered  later  in  the\nsoftware  development  cycle  (e.g.  when  the  product  has  been  shipped  to  the  customer).\nMoreover, security breach announcements by the user organizations have been known to\nhave a negative impact on the share value for firms. Cavusoglu et al (2004) show that the\nmarket  capitalization  values  of  firms  decreases,  on  average,  by  $2.1  billion  within  two\ndays  of  a  security  breach.  Cyber  insurance  firm  J.S.  Wurzler  charges  an  additional\npremium  to  firms  for  using  Windows  NT  due  to  the  number  of  security  breaches  in  the\nsoftware  (Gordon,  Loeb  and  Sohail,  2003).  Clearly,  poor  security  costs  the  users  of  the\nsoftware.  Thus, the cost to the vendor can be written as\nCost of vulnerability disclosure to vendor = Cost of patching the vulnerability + λ * (Cost\nto the users of the software due to exploitation, and/or cost to patch the system)\nHere,  λ  is  the  internalization  factor.  That  is  the  user  loss  that  is  internalized  by  the\nvendor  due  to  lost  sale  or  reputation  loss  (or  liability  if  imposed  in  future).  Clearly,  λ\ndepends on how willing users are to “punish” the vendor, how competitive the market is\nand the characteristics of vulnerability (Arora, Telang and Xu 2004). For example, this is a\ntypical customer reaction.\n\"We  are  extremely  concerned  by  the  high  amount  of  vulnerabilities  and  patches  from\nMicrosoft. This goes against the credibility of what they have been saying,\"\nMichael Kamens, global security director at Thermo Electron Corp.\nGiven the fact the competitors seem to be using vulnerability disclosure as a strategic way\nto  undermine  the  rivals’  reputations,  it  seems  that  vulnerability  disclosure  signals  a\npotential loss in future cash flows for a software vendor owing to customer dissatisfaction\nbecause customers suffer a loss if their systems get breached. It also signals an increase in\nproduct  related  costs  due  to  the  time  and  effort  that  the  vendor  spends  in  developing  a\npatch or a fix for the flaw. Therefore, we hypothesize that\nH1: A software vendor suffers a loss in market value when a security related vulnerability\nis announced in its products.\nOur second hypothesis pertains to whether the software vendor releases a patch for the\nproduct  at  the  time  of  the  vulnerability  announcement.    As  per  the  popular  convention\nfollowed in the vulnerabilities market, vendors are given some time to work on a patch for\nthe vulnerability before it is made public. Vendors may also provide a workaround (such as\ndisabling features of the software) when a vulnerability is disclosed and choose to address\nthe  vulnerability  in  a  future  upgrade.  Presence  of  the  patch  is  also  likely  to  reduce\ncustomers’  loss  if  they  apply  the  patch.  Since  presence  of  patch  also  reflects  vendor’s\ncommitment  to  its  customers  we  expect  that  vulnerabilities  disclosed  with  a  patch  will\ncompensate, to an extent, the negative signal due to vulnerability disclosure. Vendors are\nalso  pushing  for  limited  disclosures  so  that  they  can  release  the  remedial  patch  in  time.\nThis also suggests that patches play a critical role. Therefore our second hypothesis is:\nH2: CAR (Cumulative Abnormal Return) [negative] of a stock is greater for vulnerabilities\nwhere  the  software  vendor  does  not  release  a  patch  at  the  time  of  the  vulnerability\ndisclosure.\nThe  damages  suffered  by  a  software  vendor’s  customers  due  to  a  vulnerability  in  the\nvendor’s software  depend on the  type of security breach that the vulnerability  facilitates.\nCampbell  et  at  (2003)  classify  the  security  breaches  as  confidentiality  related  and  non-\nconfidentiality  related.  Confidentiality  related  breaches  involve  attacks  where  an  intruder\ncan  gain  access  into  a  system  and  can  steal  sensitive  information.  Non-confidentiality\nrelated breaches include attacks like denial of service (DoS) attacks where the most likely\nscenario  is  a  disruption  and/or  a  downtime.  Campbell  et  al  (2003)  further  show  that  the\nloss  in  market  value  is  more  for  confidentiality  related  breaches  than  for  non-\nconfidentiality related breaches. Hovav and D’Arcy (2003) show that DoS attacks are not\nassociated with any significant loss in market value for a firm. Therefore we would expect\nthat  the  vendor  loses  more  market  value  if  the  vulnerability  in  its  software  causes  a\nconfidentiality  related  breach.  The  intuition  is  that  the  negative  reaction  due  to  the\nvulnerability  is  more  if  the  customers  can  potentially  suffer  greater  losses  due  to  the\nvulnerability. Therefore, our next hypothesis is:\nH3:  CAR  is  greater  for  a  vulnerability  which  can  potentially  cause  a  breach  in\nconfidentiality as compared to non-confidentiality related breaches.\nThe  impact  of  a  software  flaw  on  a  vendor  also  depends  on  how  severe  the\nvulnerability is. Davidson and Worrell (1992) conduct an event study with product defect\nannouncements  in  the  tire  industry  and  showed  that  the  impact  of  severe  flaws  (which\ninvolve  a  recall)  is  more  than  that  of  less  severe  flaws  (which  involve  repairs  but  nor\nrecall). Sometimes an ‘exploit’ exists for the vulnerability at the time of announcement. An\n‘exploit’  is  a  piece  of  code  which  anyone  can  use  to  compromise  the  security  of  the\nsoftware product and subsequently of other information assets. Therefore, we propose our\nnext set of hypotheses as:\nH4a:  The  loss  in  market  value  of  a  software  vendor  is  greater  if  the  announced\nvulnerability has a higher severity.\nH4b: The loss in market value of a software vendor is greater if an exploit exists publicly\nat the time of the vulnerability announcement.\nA  recent  article  in  the  Wall  Street  Journal  hinted  that  firms  are  using  vulnerability\ndisclosure as a strategic weapon against competitors. E.g. ISS disclosed a vulnerability in\nrival  Checkpoint’s  flagship  firewall  product  just  ahead  of  Checkpoint’s  investor  summit.\nVendors themselves disclose vulnerability information in their products routinely. In fact,\nmany believe that vendors would prefer not to disclose information at all but they fear that\nsomeone  else  would  do  it.  Generally  vendors  are  likely  to  be  more  careful  about  the\ndisclosure  as  opposed  to  third  party.  Moreover,  disclosure  by  vendors  would  signal  their\ncommitment to providing secure software, we hypothesize that\nH5:  The  loss  in  market  value  for  a  software  vendor  is  lower  in  case  the  security\nvulnerability is discovered by the vendor itself rather than by rivals or third party security\nfirms.\nOur  final  hypothesis  relates  to  the  publication  where  vulnerability  is  reported.  Some\nvulnerabilities are reported in popular press. Others find mention only in industry sources\nlike  CERT  or  technology  news  portals  like  news.com.  The  question  which  arises  is\nwhether  both  sources  are  equally  influential  in  affecting  a  stock’s  CAR?  One  would\nsuspect the popular press of being more influential than industry sources because it reaches\na broader audience. So our next hypothesis is:\nH6:  The  magnitude  of  CAR  is  more  when  the  vulnerability  is  reported  in  popular  press\nthan in industry sources.\n4. Data Description & Methodology\n4.1 Vulnerability Disclosure Process\nThe typical process of vulnerability disclosure takes place as shown in Figure 1.\nThe  process  starts  with  the  vulnerability  discovery.  There  are  various  sources  for\nvulnerability discovery. Some vulnerabilities are discovered by amateur researchers or by\nindependent  security  analysts  (ISA)  like  eEye  Security.    If  the  ISA  chooses  to  follow\n‘limited  disclosure’,  it  reports  the  vulnerability  to  the  concerned  vendor  or  to  an\nindependent body like CERT who disclose the vulnerability to public later (generally after\nthe  fix  has  been  made  available)  in  a  limited  way .    Sometimes,  the  vendor  itself  might\ndiscover  a  vulnerability  in  its  products.",
         "1. Introduction\nMany believe that software vendors typically follow the policy of ‘sell today and fix it\ntomorrow’;  or  ‘I’d  rather  have  it  wrong  than  have  it  late’  (Paulk  et  al  1994;  Arora,\nCaulkins,  Telang  2004)  for  launching  software  products  in  the  market.

         "Many believe that software vendors typically follow the policy of ‘sell today and fix it\ntomorrow’;  or  ‘I’d  rather  have  it  wrong  than  have  it  late’  (Paulk  et  al  1994;  Arora,\nCaulkins,  Telang  2004)  for  launching  software  products  in  the  market.  This  policy,\ndictated by the need to launch products quickly before competitors, seemed to work in the\npast because software errors which escape detection during pre-launch testing appear very\ninfrequently  in  normal  operations  (once  every  ‘5000’  years,  as  per  Adams,  1980).\nHowever,  Adams’  ‘5000-year  error’  theory  might  not  hold  in  the  internet  age  because\nhundreds  (if  not  thousands)  of  people  are  looking  for  flaws  in  other  vendors  software\nproducts,  drastically  increasing  the  chances  that  a  flaw  will  be  exposed.

Moreover, vulnerability disclosure is finding its way\ninto  firms’  strategy  toolkits  as  it  evident  from  a  WSJ  report  in  Feb  2004  that  software\nvendors are spending time and effort in discovering flaws in their rivals’ software products\nin  order  to  influence  the  rivals’  stock  prices.  For  example,  security  software  vendor  IDS\nreleased a vulnerability alert on rival Checkpoint’s firewall software on the day Checkpoint\nusually  holds  its  annual  US  investor  conference.  Some  examples  of  vulnerability\nannouncements reported in popular press are:\n•  News.com(04/25/2000)  “A  computer  security\nfirm  has  discovered  a  serious\nvulnerability  in  Red  Hat’s  newest  version  of  Linux  that  could  let  attackers  destroy  or\ndeface a Web site  - or possibly even take over the machine itself……..”\n•  WSJ(02/11/2004) “Microsoft Corp. warned customers about serious security problems\nwith  its  Windows  software  that  let  hackers  quietly  break  into  their  computers  to  steal\nfiles, delete data or eavesdrop on sensitive information……..”\nInspite  of  all  these  concerns  about  software  vulnerabilities,  not  much  has  been\nmentioned  in  literature  about  the  incentive  of  software  vendors  to  invest  in  defect-free\nsoftware. Literature on software risks fails to include any measure for security related risks\n(Wallace, Keil and Rai, 2004; Barki, Rivard and Talbot, 1993). The closest literature to the\ntopic of security vulnerabilities is that on software quality (Basili and Musa, 1991; Harter,\nKrishnan  and  Slaughter,  2000).  However,  in  traditional  literature,  quality  is  measured  in\nterms  of  reliability  and  integrity  of  the  source  code  –  which  essentially  tests  software\nagainst specified streams of input from users. However, in today’s internet age, software\ndesigners  must  not  only  think  of  users,  but  also  malicious  adversaries  (Devanbu  and\nStubblebine,  2000).  Some  quality  models  such  as  ISO9126  fail  to  include  computer\nsecurity  (Pfleegar  1997).  Therefore  software  which  has  been  certified  as  high  quality,\nbased  on  existing  definitions  of  software  quality,  can  have  many  security  flaws.\nResearchers in computer science are working on better integration of the two disciplines of\nsoftware  quality  and  software  security  while  designing  software  (Carr,  Tynan  and  Davis\n1991, Wang and Wang, 2003; McGraw 2004).\nSo far, there has only been anecdotal evidence that software vulnerabilities are causing\nvendors to lose market value. For example, the Wall Street Journal (11/09/2004) reported\nthat Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) is losing market share in the web browser market to\ncompetitors like Mozilla’s Firefox, due to numerous flaws discovered in IE. For example,\nnearly  8  millio",

The  F-test  (p-value  0.001)  for  the  overall  model\nsuggests that our model is highly significant. The constant in the regression is simply the\naverage  of  all  the  fixed  effects  in  the  model.  Our  regression  provides  several  interesting\nobservations regarding the effect of the vulnerability characteristics on the stock price of\nthe vendor.\n1.  Severity: The coefficient on the SEVR variable in Table 6 is negative and significant\n(though  at  p  =  0.1).  This  is  consistent  with  results  in  Table  5.  More  severe\nvulnerabilities have a higher potential to cause damage and hence have a larger adverse\nimpact  on  CAR.  On  average,  a  severe  vulnerability  can  cost  a  software  vendor  0.6%\nmore than a non-severe vulnerability, providing support to hypothesis H4.\n2.  Patch:  We  also  find  that  the  non-availability  of  a  patch  is  positive  and  significantly\ncorrelated with the market value. This provides support to hypothesis H2 because the\ncoefficient  on  the  PATCH  variable  suggests  that  on  average,  firms  which  do  not\nprovide a patch at the time of the vulnerability disclosure suffer a loss of 0.83% more\nthan firms which provide a patch.\n3.  Confidentiality:  The  coefficient  of  the  DOS  variable  is  0.0076.  This  implies  that\nvulnerabilities which result in a non-confidential breach (denial of service, disruptions\nin  service)  have  an  abnormal  return  of  0.76%  higher  than  the  vulnerabilities  which\nresult in a confidentiality-related breach. This confirms our hypothesis H3.\nNone of the other coefficients are significant (except time coefficients). Thus our results\nfail to provide support for hypothesis H5 and H6. From table 5 also, we can observe that\nnone  of  the  sub-samples  (other  than  the  Press  sub-sample)  has  a  significant  coefficient.\nThe rejection of hypothesis H5 is especially interesting because it suggests that the markets\ndo not penalize a vendor any more if the vulnerability is discovered by a third party than\nby the vendor itself.\nWe also control for the effect of the time period during which the vulnerabilities were\nannounced  to  control  for  time-specific  investor  sentiments  which  can  affect  abnormal\nreturns.  We  find  that  software  vendors  suffered  the  greatest  abnormal  returns  in  the  one\nyear period post 9/11; for example, on average, vendors lost 2% more in market value for\neach vulnerability announcement in the year following 9/11 than they did in the baseline\nperiod  (2003-04).  This  suggests  that  security  concerns  among  investors  were  highest\nduring this period, as an aftermath of September 11. The next highest period of abnormal\nreturns was the one-year time frame after the dot-com crash, i.e. from Sept 2000 to Sept\n2001.  In  this  period,  software  vendors  lost,  on  average,  1.0%  more  on  vulnerability\nannouncements than in the baseline period. The results also suggest that year 2003-04 is\nwhen the vendors suffered the least. It is possible  that  vulnerability  announcements  have\nbecome  commonplace  and  are  not  affecting  the  vendors  as  much.  But,  more  research  is\nneeded to provide a definitive answer.\n6. Conclusions and Discussion\nTo  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  to  analyze  the  impact  of  product\ndefects on software vendors. We also analyze the information content of the vulnerability\ndisclosure  announcement  and  classify  vulnerabilities  into  various  sub-types  based  on  the\nfollowing  characteristics:\nthe  source  of  vulnerability  disclosure,  severity  of\nthe\nvulnerability, availability of a fix, whether an exploit was publicly available at the time of\ndiscovery,  the  type  of  security  breach  caused  by  the  vulnerability  and  the  source  of\nvulnerability discovery. Our results show that vulnerability disclosure leads to a significant\nloss  of  market  value  for  software  vendors.  This  indicates  that  the  stock  markets  react\nnegatively  to  the  news  of  a  vulnerability  disclosure,  because  the  discovery  of  a\nvulnerability  could  suggest  a  loss  in  future  cash  flow  of  the  software  vendors.  Software\nvulnerabilities affect the cash flows of a vendor in two main ways: One, the vendor has to\nspend time and effort in providing a patch for the vulnerability, which increases the overall\ncost  of  the  software  product  and  hence  reduces  profits.  Vulnerabilities  may  also  lead  to\ncustomer  dissatisfaction  because  the  customer  has  to  spend  time  and  effort  in  installing\npatches  and  is  exposed  to  a  risk  of  security  related  attacks.  This  could  further  lead  to\ncustomers  shifting  to  competitor’s  products  and  hence  reduces  the  cash  flow  for  the\nvendors’  products.  This  has  implications  for  software  vendors  to  invest  in  improving  the\nquality of their software. While vendors would like to launch software products as soon as\npossible, our study shows that vendors need to focus testing in  areas that can potentially\ncontain  greater  number  of  security  vulnerabilities.  We  also  show  that  the  effect  of  a\nvulnerability  announcement  is  quickly  incorporated  into  the  stock  price  and  after  the\nsecond day, there is no significant impact on the stock prices. We check for the robustness\nof our results in terms of checking for outliers and checking for momentum effects in the\nstock returns. We find that our results are also robust to the effect of investor sentiments\nsince we control for the effect of various time periods in our regression.\nOur study also provides preliminary evidence that firms should integrate security into\nsoftware  quality  practices.  In  a  firm  with  limited  resources,  this  would  mean  focusing\ntesting  efforts  in  areas  that  have  a  greater  number  of  security  vulnerabilities.  Although\nresearchers  in  computer  science  have  stressed  on  this  fact  (McGraw  2004),  there  hardly\nexists  any  literature  in  software  engineering  economics  which  measures  the  return  on\ninvestment  of  incorporating  security  based  metrics  in  software  quality  or  software  risk\nassessment.  While  software  quality  traditionally  deals  with  functional  testing,  complete\nsecurity  testing  would  incorporate  non-functional  testing  we  well,  i.e.  subjecting  the\nsoftware to misspecified input streams (Potter and McGraw 2004).\nOur  results  also  show  that  vulnerabilities  which  are  severe  or  which  can  cause  a\nconfidentiality  related  attack  are  likely  to  result  in  a  greater  loss  in  market  value  for  a\nvendor. This has implications for the software vendor in terms of allocating resources for\nsoftware  testing  and  quality  improvements.  For  example,  vendors  should  focus  on\nspending more resources in testing those software modules where a flaw is more likely to\ncause  a  confidentiality  related  breach.  Campbell  et  al  (2003)  show  that  confidentiality\nrelated breaches cause a greater loss to firms; we complement that result by showing that\nsoftware vulnerabilities which cause a confidentiality related breach are likely to result in a\ngreater loss in market value for the vendor.\nComparison with prior event studies:\nIt is interesting to compare how the abnormal returns in our event study compare with\nresults in prior event studies. Specifically, we compare our results with event studies in the\nfollowing  categories:  security  breach  related  announcements,  IT  investment  related\nannouncements and product defect related announcements.\nTable-7  shows  that  our  results  are  comparable  to  prior  studies  on  product  defects  and\nproduct  recall  announcements.  It  is  especially  interesting  to  note  that  the  loss  in  market\nvalue that vendors suffer due to a security vulnerability is much less than that suffered by\nfirms  during  a  security  breach.  A  possible  reason  could  be  that  software  vendors  are\nprotected  by  click-wrap  agreements  and  have  only  limited  liability  for  any  flaw  in  their\nproducts.  Another  reason  is  that  firms  usually  supply  a  patch  with  the  vulnerability\ndisclosure (almost 76% of observations in our sample have a patch available at the time of\ndisclosure).  Therefore  security  breaches  are  not  so  much  caused  due  to  unprotected\nvulnerabilities as due to lack of adequate patching done by firms. E.g. the SQL Slammer\nvirus, which affected millions of servers worldwide, was created when hackers exploited a\nsix month old vulnerability in SQL. Microsoft had already released a patch for the same,\nbut,  as  demonstrated  by  the  Slammer,  many  firms  had  not  adequately  protected  their\nservers by applying the patch.\nTable 7: Summary of previous event studies\nClassification of Event\nStudy\nImpact of Vulnerability\nDisclosures on\nSoftware Vendors\nImpact of Security\nBreaches on Firms\nAuthors\nTelang R and S Wattal (2004)\nTime\nPeriod\n1999-2004\nCAR\n-0.63%\nCampbell K, Gordon LA, Loeb MP\nand L Zhou (2003)\nCavusoglu H, Mishra B and S\nRaghunathan (2004)\n1995-2000\n-2.0%*\n1998-2000\n-2.1%\nImpact of Product\nRecall Announcements\nImpact of IT\nInvestment\nAnnouncements\nHovav A and J D’Arcy (2003)\n1998-2002\nKannan K, Rees J and S Sridhar\n(2004)\nJarrell G and S Peltzman (1985)\n1997-2003\n1967-1981\n1968-1987\n1987-1998\nDavidson WL III and DL Worrell\n(1992)\nChatterjee D, Richardson VJ and\nRW Zmud (2001)\nIm KS, Dow KE and V Grover\n(2001)\nSubramani M and E Walden (2001)  Oct 1998-\nDec 1998\n1981-1988\nDos Santos BL, Peffers K and DC\nMauer (1993)\n1981-1996\nNot\nSignificant\n-0.73%\n-0.81%\n(for auto)\n-0.36%\n(day -1)\n1.16%\nNot\nSignificant\n7.5%\n1%\nImpact of Winning a\nQuality Award\nHendricks KB and Singhal VR\n(1996)\nImplications for Software Quality and Disclosure Policy\n1985-1991\n0.59%\nAs we noted in introduction, one major argument given by the full disclosure group\nis that it will eventually force the vendors to improve the quality of their product. From our\nanalysis, there seems to be some support for this argument. Disclosure, in general (with or\nwithout a patch) adversely affects the market valuation of the vendors. It is more severe in\ncase  of  without  patch  (which  is  what  generally  happens  during  full  disclosure).  Thus,\ndisclosure clearly creates some incentives for vendors to produce better quality software.\nHowever,  market  value  is  only  one  metric  to  capture  the  impact  of  disclosure.

         "ions and mechanisms\nfor dealing with the heterogeneity of sensor nodes should be provided. All mechanisms\nprovided by a middleware system should accommodate special characteristics of WSN,\nwhich mostly boils down to energy eﬃciency, robustness, and scalability”.\nNode Localization\nThis thesis describes a middleware service called node localization and presents a\nnew method for node localization. Node localization, also known as self-localization, is\nthe problem of localizing physical sensor nodes in a given sensor network deployment.\nLocalization is an essential tool for the deployment of low-cost sensor networks for\nuse in location-aware applications [27, 33, 24] and ubiquitous networking [7, 19]. In\na typical sensor network application each sensor node monitors and gathers local\ninformation. This local information has signiﬁcance if it can be tied to the physical\nlocation it belongs to. For example in a habitat monitoring application a temperature\nor humidity measurement by a smart sensor doesn’t provide the complete information\nbut once combined with the physical location of the sensor, the measurements can be\nused to build a temperature or humidity map of the local region. In location-critical\napplications, such as shooter-localization, sub-meter accuracy of 3D node locations is\nan absolute necessity for the correct operation of the system [12].\nLocalization can be either range-free [34] or range-based. Range-free localization\ntechniques provide rough estimates of node positions only. Ranging methods for\nrange-based localization fall into two main classes: acoustic and radio signal strength-\nbased. The latter requires extensive calibration, yet it still achieves low accuracy and\nlimited range. Acoustic ranging has relatively high accuracy, but short range. The\nmain reasons are the limited acoustic energy a sensor node can emit and the relatively\nhigh environmental noise. Having a speaker or sounder on every node adds size and\ncost also. When stealthy operation is required, only ultrasound can be used. But\nultrasonic ranging has even more limited range and directionality constraints.\nSensor Network Deployment\nThere are many sensor network deployment scenarios suggested for practical and\nuseful application. Simple but impractical deployment schemes include manually\nplacing the nodes on speciﬁed locations or random deployment of nodes in a rec-\ntangular grid. We propose a new practical sensor network deployment scenario with\nmany favorable characteristics in numerous application areas is the dispersal of sensor\nnodes from a low-ﬂying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. An acoustic beacon\nmounted on the aircraft can send a radio message followed by an acoustic signal at\nrandom intervals. All the nearby sensor nodes can estimate their distance from the\nbeacon by measuring the time-of-ﬂight of the sound.

         "on\nthe signiﬁcance of deployment strategy and localization algorithm presented in this\nthesis.\nCHAPTER II\nAPPLICATIONS\nCurrent and potential application areas for wireless sensor networks include habi-\ntat monitoring, geophysical monitoring, precision agriculture, military systems, sur-\nveillance systems, traﬃc monitoring, business processes management, smart building\nmanagement, and in the future, possibly smart homes for everybody.\nTwo very interesting applications are described in this chapter. The ﬁrst one is\nthat of habitat monitoring of Great Duck Island oﬀ the coast of Maine designed by\nUniversity of California at Berkeley [1], and the second is a countersniper system\ndesigned and developed at Vanderbilt University [12].\nHabitat Monitoring\nIn fragile habitats, such as a small island, human intervention for observation and\ndata gathering can adversely aﬀect the small ecosystem. Sensor networks provide\nnon-invasive methods of observation of such fragile ecosystems. Sensor networks also\nenable life science researchers to observe and monitor habitats that are not easily\naccessible to humans.\nSensor nodes with weather sensor boards were deployed in the observation area\nand their location were recorded. The weather sensor boards had temperature, light,\nbarometric pressure, humidity and passive infrared sensors. The data recorded by\nsensors would be transmitted to the base-station. Base-stations would transfer the\ndata over network to data storage or client data processing units. In this way sensor\nnetworks allow clients to remotely monitor the habitat. Figure II.1 [1] shows the\nsystem architecture for habitat monitoring.\nFigure II.1: System architecture for habitat monitoring\nShooter Localization\nCountersniper systems are important tools for armed forces and law enforcement\nagencies. Many systems have been developed in the past but only a few can meet the\nrequirements in complex environment as urban terrain. Simon [12] notes that “the\nmain problems degrading the performance of these systems are the poor coverage due\nto the shading eﬀect of the buildings and the presence of multipath eﬀects”.\nSeveral physical phenomenon associated with shot ﬁring can be used for shooter\nlocalization. The most obvious acoustic event due to ﬁring of a conventional weapon\nis the muzzle blast. The countersniper system in [12] utilizes this muzzle blast and\nthe shockwave generated by the supersonic bullet to localize the shooter. Figure\nII.2 [12] shows the simpliﬁed geometry of the bullet trajectory and the associated\nmuzzle blast and shockwave fronts. The muzzle blast produces a spherical wave\nfront, traveling at the speed of sound (v ) from the muzzle (A) to the sensor (S). The\nshock wave is generated in every point of the trajectory of the supersonic projectile\nproducing a cone-shaped wave front, assuming the speed of the projectile is constant\nFigure II.2: Muzzle blast and shock wave\nv . The shockwave reaching sensor S was generated in point X. The angle of the\nshockwave cone is determined by the speed of the projectile. The sensor nodes detect\nand measure the time of arrival (TOA) of shockwaves and muzzle blasts. The system\nthen utilizes the measurements to localize the source of muzzle blast.\nIt is crucial to have accurate sensor node locations for the correct and accurate op-\neration of shooter localization application described above. The shooter-localization\napplication localizes the shooter based on the TOA of muzzle blast and shockwaves\nand the locations of the sensor nodes that detect muzzle blast. The errors in sensor\nnode locations are propagated to the shooter localization errors. A more detailed il-\nlustration of eﬀect of node location errors on shooter location error is given in chapter\nV.\nCHAPTER III\nEXISTING LOCALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES\nSelf localization, due to its importance in sensor network applications, has been\nan active research area for the past few years. An early survey of localization systems\nin presented by Hightower and Boriello in [14]. Many of these systems adopt a simple\nconnectivity based ranging approach, while some of them further reﬁne range esti-\nmates between node pairs by measuring the received radio signal strength. However,\nRSS based ranging requires extensive calibration and still yields inaccurate range es-\ntimates [22] resulting in coarse localization. A number of recent localization systems\nuse acoustic time of ﬂight for ranging. The calibration required for acoustic ranging\nis minimal. The localization system presented in this work uses acoustic ranging.\nOne of the earliest and most popular localization systems is GPS or Global Po-\nsitioning System [13]. GPS was designed by and is controlled by the United States\nDepartment of Defense. GPS is a satellite navigation system used for global outdoor\nlocalization and providing highly accurate global time reference, which is useful, for\nexample, in military operations. The project, started in 1978, uses a multi-million\ndollar infrastructure of 52 GPS satellites, the latest of which was launched in 2004.\nDespite the popularity and easy accessibility of GPS receivers they are not suitable\nfor localization in wireless sensor networks. The reasons for this are the cost factor,\npower consumption and the localization accuracy. Even the best GPS receivers do\nnot claim more than 2-3 meter resolution and can have up to 10-20 meter localization\nerror. This accuracy is acceptable for applications like vehicle navigation or landmark\nlocalization but it is not suﬃcient for many sensor network applications.\nRadio Connectivity and Hop Based Ranging\nMany localization algorithms are based on simple circular radio connectivity model\n[8]. In this approach the radio transmitter is sitting at the center of the circular region\nand all nodes within this region are considered connected to the transmitter. This\nmodel is very simple and doesn’t require any special ranging infrastructure. The\nnetwork routing infrastructure can be used for radio connectivity based ranging. The\nlocalization systems that are based on this approach are [28, 10]. There are several\nproblems with ranging based on radio connectivity. Asymmetries in the environment\nor in the antenna’s orientation can aﬀect radio connectivity. Furthermore, the radio\nranges show probabilistic behavior i.e.\ntwo radio nodes are connected with some\nprobability. This link quality is illustrated in Figure III.1 [8]. Apart from the problem\nFigure III.1: Radio connectivity over distance\nof being probably connected links there are two more issues with this approach. Even\nif two radio nodes are connected to a transmitter, the model is insuﬃcient to tell\nwhich node is closer. Finally, many pairs whose connectivity falls near the boundary\nwill oscillate between being connected and disconnected.\nA simple connectivity-based localization system by Bulushu [28] employs a grid\nof reference nodes with overlapping regions. Unknown nodes localize themselves to\nthe centroid of their proximate reference nodes. The accuracy of localization is then\ndependent on the separation distance between two adjacent reference nodes and the\ntransmission range of these reference nodes. Experiments show localization accuracy\nof about one third of separation distance between reference nodes.\nNiculescu and Nath [10] proposed a distributed hop by hop localization algorithm\ncalled APS (Ad hoc Positioning System). The idea here was to propagate the anchor\nnode location information in the network. Nodes with unknown location note the\nshortest hop count to each of the anchor nodes and multiply this with an average hop\ndistance to get an approximate distance to each of the anchor nodes. Nodes can then\nperform triangulation to get an estimate of their locations. They describe three diﬀer-\nent propagation methods, DV-Hop, DV-distance and Euclidean propagation methods,\neach providing diﬀerent tradeoﬀ between accuracy, signaling complexity, coverage and\nisotropy of the network. Typical location errors were of the order of 20 − 150% of\nradio range.\nDoherty [21] formulated self localization as a geometric constraint feasibility prob-\nlem based on node connectivity. The problem was formulated as, given anchor node\nlocations ﬁnd a possible position for each unknown node subjected to the proximity\nconstraints between node pairs imposed by known connections. The problem was\nsolved using convex optimization. Additionally, rectangular bounds on node posi-\ntions were used for tighter geometric constraints. Doherty noted that provided tight\nenough geometric constraints, simulations show that the node estimates become close\nto actual node locations. For sensor network of 200 nodes in a 10×10 R region, where\nR was the maximum range. The simulations show that the mean location errors were\n1 − 9 R for diﬀerent anchor nodes ratios.\nRadio Signal Strength Based Ranging\nSeveral localization systems use received radio signal strength to estimate ranges\nbetween transmitter and receiver. Recent research projects in ad-hoc localization\nusing signal strength are SpotON [15] and AHLoS [4] among others. For a symmetric\ntransmitting antenna in a near-ideal environment signal strength at a receiver with\ndistance r from a transmitter can be described by RADAR equation,\nP  =\nP G A\n4πR\n(III.1)\nwhere P  is the received power, P  is the transmit power, G  is antenna gain, A  is\nthe eﬀective receiver area and R is the distance between transmitter and receiver.\nSince receiver area A  is constant, signal strength is eﬀectively inversely proportional\nto square of the distance. This simple radio signal strength model is unreliable in\ncomplex indoor or urban environments due to obstacles and reﬂections. Figure III.2\n[11] shows the observed mean and standard deviation of signal strength with distance\nin a near-ideal environment i.e. outdoor ﬁeld.\nSavarese [5] follows two phase localization algorithm,, containing a start-up and\na reﬁnement phase. The start-up phase utilizes the hop-TERRAIN algorithm which\nis similar to DV-hop [10]. The hop-TERRAIN algorithm ﬁnds the number of hops\nfrom a node to each anchor nodes and then multiplies this hop count by an average\nhop distance to estimate the range from anchors. The nodes with distances from\nanchors and known anchor location triangulate their estimated position. The second\nstage called the reﬁnement is an iterative algorithmic step that uses the ranges and the\nlocation estimates from hop-TERRAIN phase. Reﬁnement updates the node positions\nFigure III.2: Radio signal strength\nin a number of steps. Savarese [5] also introduces a crude notion of conﬁdence value,\na metric for the quality of location estimate.\nSavvides [3] solves for unknown node position estimates by setting up a global non-\nlinear optimization problem and solving it using iterative least-squares. The method\nrequires the known beacons to surround the unknown nodes, which the author calls\nbeacon-unknown node convexity. However, this topology constraint is hard to satisfy\nwith airborne deployment of sensor nodes in hostile urban areas.\nAcoustic Time of Flight Based Ranging\nThe ranging techniques based on time of ﬂight (TOF) measurements of signals\nprovide better results that are suﬃcient for ﬁne-grained localization [18]. RF time of\nﬂight based techniques, like GPS, have limited applicability in sensor networks. Much\nbetter ranging results can be achieved when acoustic and RF signals are combined\n[22, 2]. Recently, several localization methods have been proposed that utilize distance\nestimates using time-of-ﬂight measurements [32, 2, 30]. Acoustic signals, however,\nare temperature dependent and require an unobstructed line of sight. In a typical\nindoor or urban environment non-line of sight range measurements, or multi-paths\nproduce false ranges that are diﬃcult to separate from good ranges. Also, the ratio of\nmulti-paths to line-of-sight range measurements is considerable, thus any algorithm\nlocalizing nodes in such scenarios has to consider multi-path propagation.\nCricket [30, 31] is an indoor location support system for pervasive and sensor-\nbased computing applications. Cricket is intended for use indoors or in urban areas\nwhere outdoor systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS) don’t work well.\nCricket uses a combination of RF and ultrasound to provide a location-support ser-\nvice to users and applications. Wall and ceiling-mounted beacons are spread through\nthe building, publishing location information on an RF signal. With each RF adver-\ntisement, the beacon transmits a concurrent ultrasonic pulse. The listeners receive\nthese RF and ultrasonic signals, correlate them to each other, estimate distances to\nthe diﬀerent beacons using the diﬀerence in RF and ultrasonic signal propagation\ntimes, and therefore infer the space they are currently in.\nWe use acoustic time of ﬂight based ranging developed at Vanderbilt University\n[18] in our localization system. It is described in detail in section IV.\nThere are few approaches that deal with multi-path propagation. One such ap-\nproach for two dimensions is presented by Moore [9].\nIt identiﬁes multi-paths as\ngeometric impossibilities. Moore et. al.\nformulated node localization as a two-\ndimensional graph realization problem. They identiﬁed that due to insuﬃcient or\nnoisy data there could be ambiguity or uncertainty in node positions. The two types\nof ambiguities in a graph that prevent unique realization are ﬂip and ﬂex ambiguities\nas shown in Figure III.3[9]. As deﬁned in [9], “Flip ambiguities (Figure III.3a) occur\nfor a graph in a d-dimensional space when the positions of all neighbors of some ver-\ntex span a (d − 1)-dimensional subspace. In this case, the neighbors create a mirror\nFigure III.3: (a) Flip ambiguity. Vertex A can be reﬂected across the line connecting\nB and C with no change in the distance constraints. (b) Discontinuous ﬂex ambiguity.\nIf edge AD is removed, then reinserted, the graph can ﬂex in the direction of the arrow,\ntaking on a diﬀerent conﬁguration but exactly preserving all distance constraints.\nthrough which the vertex can be reﬂected. Discontinuous ﬂex ambiguities (Figure\nIII.3b) occur when the removal of one edge will allow part of the graph to be ﬂexed\nto a diﬀerent conﬁguration and the removed edge reinserted with the same length”.\nThey introduce the concept of robust quadrilaterals to overcome these ambiguities.\nIn terms of graph theory a robust quadrilateral is a set of four fully-connected nodes\nthat are unique up to a global rotation, translation and reﬂection, i.e. it is globally\nrigid. The idea can be extended to three dimensions but as [9] noted, under low\nconnectivity or high measurement noise conditions the algorithm may be unable to\nlocalize a useful number of nodes. Another case where the geometric constraint based\necho identiﬁcation fails is when there is disproportionate geometry thickness in one\ndirection. In a typical sensor network the X and Y distribution of nodes is much\nhigher than that in Z which can aﬀect the performance of the algorithm.\nThe localization algorithm presented in this thesis models the problem as global\nnon-linear optimization problem as in [3], however it goes one step further to deal\nwith echoes and non-convexity of anchor-unknown node topology.\nCHAPTER IV\nAPPLIED ACOUSTIC RANGING\nThe localization system described in this work uses acoustic time-of-ﬂight based\nranging developed at Vanderbilt University [18]. The concept of acoustic ranging is\nbased on measuring the time of ﬂight of the sound signal between the signal source\n(beacon) and the acoustic sensor. The range estimate can be trivially calculated from\nthe time measurement. However, the speed of sound is temperature dependent. As-\nsuming insigniﬁcant spatial temperature distribution in the sensor ﬁeld, this problem\ncan be solved by a single temperature measurement at the base station. An appealing\ncharacteristic of the proposed ranging algorithm is that this is the only calibration\nthat is needed. That is the sensors do not need individual calibration at all.\nHardware\nThe acoustic ranging application targets the MICA2 motes developed at UC\nBerkeley [16]. The mote is equipped with a custom acoustic sensor board, which\nwas developed at the Vanderbilt University for a shooter localization application [12].\nThe heart of the sensor board is a low-power ﬁxed point ADSP-2189 digital signal\nprocessor running at 50 MHz (see Figure IV.1). The availability of the DSP enables\nthe implementation of sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms .\nThere are two independent analog input channels on the board, furnished with\nlow-cost electret microphones and 2-stage ampliﬁers with software programmable gain\n(0-54dB). The analog channels are sampled by A/D converters at up to 100kSPS with\n12-bit resolution. The board also has an analog output channel capable of driving a\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure IV.1: Ranging hardware (a) MICA2 motes, (b) acoustic sensor board\n250 mW external loudspeaker. The board is connected to the mote by programmable\ninterrupt and acknowledgment lines and a standard I2C bus.\nIn the current implementation the mobile beacon is based on a MICA2 mote\nand the same sensor board with an active loudspeaker attached to its analog output\nchannel. The maximum output power is 105 dB measured 10 cm away from the\nloudspeaker.\nRanging Algorithm\nIn order to calculate the range from the time-of-ﬂight of the acoustic signal, the\ndeparture and arrival times of the signal have to be identiﬁed and measured precisely.\nThe beginning of the transmission can be measured at the beacon, while the time of\narrival is measured at the receiving sensors. The range calculation is performed on\nthe receivers, thus the beacon has to send the starting time to the receivers in a radio\nmessage.\nEmploying a sophisticated time synchronization mechanism is essential to accu-\nrately measure the time of ﬂight. Our approach employs the message time-stamping\nprimitives introduced in [26]. The synchronization between the source and sensor\nnodes is implemented as follows.\nThe source queries its local time t  and decides that it will emit an acoustic signal\nat time t     = t  + δ. The source sends the value t     to all the sensors in a radio\nmessage. Therefore the value of δ is chosen such that it is greater than the time\nrequired by the sensors to process the radio message and to prepare for reception.\nThe sensors schedule their acoustic board for sampling when the beacon starts the\ntransmission of the acoustic signal.\nWe assume that the skew of the local clocks is negligible during the short time\nof the measurement, but we allow arbitrary clock oﬀsets. Since neither the source,\nnor the sensors have knowledge of a global time, the sensors need to convert t\nincluded in the message from the local time of the source to their own local times.\nThis is achieved by timestamping the radio message at transmission and at reception\nas well. Since the radio signal is traveling at the speed of light, the diﬀerence between\nthe transmit time instant and the receive time instant is negligible, hence the trans-\nmit timestamp (given by the local clock of the beacon) and the receive timestamps\n(in the local time of the receivers) are assumed to represent the same global time\ninstance. Thus, a sensor can use the diﬀerence of the transmit timestamp and its\nreceive timestamp to calculate the oﬀset of its local clock from the local clock of the\nbeacon. This oﬀset is added to the received t     to convert it to the local time of the\nreceiver.\nFigure IV.2: The emitted acoustic signal\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure IV.3: Ranging measurement results (a) without outlier rejection, (b) with\noutlier rejection\nThe sensor node also has to measure the time of arrival of the acoustic signal. The\naccurate detection of the signal is not trivial in a noisy environment, as it is diﬃcult\nto emit sharp rising edges or pulses with general purpose loudspeakers. Additionally,\nthe signal has to be emitted with the highest power available in order to maximize\nthe range of the measurement. These requirements are analogous to the problems\nof radar signals, a well researched area [29, 23]. The problem arises as the limited\nbandwidth of the analog output channel restricts the emission of rising edges with\narbitrarily steep slope. The contradiction is resolved by long duration signals with\nshort duration correlation functions, so when the received signal goes through an\nappropriate matched ﬁlter, the output will be a sharp pulse. The emitted signal is\ntherefore a Gaussian-windowed linear frequency modulated (chirp) signal shown in\nFig.IV.2, that is commonly used in radar applications. The windowing is needed due\nto the limited bandwidth of the acoustic channel.\nA similar solution is presented in [22], where the emitted signal is a binary phase\nshift keying (BPSK) spread spectrum signal. Since our method does not require to\ndistinguish multiple sources, the use of linear frequency modulated signal is more\nnatural.\nThe frequency span of this signal is spread in the whole acoustic band of the analog\nchannels. The matched ﬁlter is realized as an FIR ﬁlter on the DSP. The matched\nﬁltering essentially means the correlation of the expected signature with the measured\ndata, therefore the length of the FIR ﬁlter is the same as the length of the expected\nsignature. To avoid a high order FIR ﬁlter which would be computationally expensive,\neither the length of the chirp signal or the sampling rate has to be decreased. However,\nas the length of the chirp signal can not be arbitrarily short due to the limited\nbandwidth of the physical hardware, the sample rate has to be decreased. Thus, the\nraw data is decimated to a lower sampling frequency before the matched ﬁltering.\nIn order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), one range measurement con-\nsists of a series of time-of-arrival measurements. As the delays between the consec-\nutive chirps are known a-priori, an accurate combined result can be calculated by\naveraging these measurements. In the averaged signal the chirp signature component\nis preserved as it is added up at the same phase, but the noise which is assumed to\nbe independent Gaussian white noise is decreased by\n√\nN where N is the number of\nchirps added. Currently we use 8 chirps, thus the SNR of the averaged signal is 9 dB\nhigher than the SNR of a single chirp.\nDelays between consecutive chirps are varied to avoid a situation when multiple\nruns have the same noise pattern at the same oﬀset, which is a common phenom-\nenon caused by acoustic multi-path eﬀects. Hence the independent nature of the\ndisturbances is preserved.\nThe decimation ﬁltering is running online on the DSP, and the decimated signal\nis stored in RAM buﬀer. The consecutive measurements are added together in the\nsame buﬀer and after all the chirps are received, the matched ﬁltering and the peak-\ndetection algorithm is performed oﬄine. The peak-detection algorithm is simply a\nmaximum ﬁnder above a threshold level, as the output of the matched ﬁlter has\ndistinctive peaks at chirps. The time of arrival of the chirp signal can easily be\nidentiﬁed based on the location of the peak.\nResults\nThe above algorithm was tested on a grassy ﬁeld with a single beacon, and multiple\nreceivers. In Fig. IV.3 the ranging results are presented, and in Fig. IV.4 the standard\ndeviation of the measurements is shown, after outlier rejection. Outlier rejection is\ndone by a simple median ﬁlter, where the values greatly diﬀering from the mean of\nthe measurements are rejected. Note that multiple measurements are needed for each\nbeacon position to perform the rejection algorithm.\nFigure IV.4: Standard deviation of ranging\nThe eﬀective range of the presented implementation is 30 meters, as the number\nof outliers and the standard deviation of the measurements are getting signiﬁcantly\nhigh above this value. Below 30 meters the standard deviation grows approximately\nlinearly, with\nST D ∼= k d + k\n(IV.1)\nwhere k  = 0.011 and k  = 0.024 and d denotes the actual distance.\nThe eﬀective range of the measurements is more than two times larger than in\nprevious acoustic ranging experiments [18, 25], where the reliable range was 10 m on\nasphalt and 15 m on grass, respectively. The standard deviation is also signiﬁcantly\nimproved.\nIn [18], the output power of the sounder was limited (88 dB at 10 cm\nfrom source) and no custom DSP board was used. In [25] the power of the beacon is\napproximately the same as in the presented solution (105 dB at 10 cm from source),\nhowever our use of the DSP board and the linear frequency modulated signal provides\nbetter performance.\nThese experimental results are very promising and justify the presented approach.\nMoreover, the current limits on range and precision are primarily caused by issues\nwith the current implementation. First, the power of the emitted acoustic signal is\nstill constrained by the gain on the output channel of the board. Second, the analog\ninput channels of the DSP board also limit the range, as it was designed for a shooter\ndetection application, where even the maximum gain is relatively low.\nCHAPTER V\nSELF LOCALIZATION\nAs described in chapter I, high node localization accuracy is an absolute necessity\nfor the correct operation of location-critical applications, such as shooter-localization.\nThe application uses TOA of acoustic signals and locations of the nodes that detect\nthe muzzle blast of shooter. If the node locations are erroneous, the error will prop-\nagate to the shooter localization error.\nAn illustration to show the eﬀect of node localization accuracy on acoustic-beacon\nlocalization is presented below. The simulation setup consists of four sensor nodes and\nan acoustic beacon in 2D plane. The goal of the simulation is to localize the beacon,\ngiven the TOA of acoustic signal from beacon to each of the sensor nodes. Sensor\nnode locations are given with zero mean and given standard deviation Gaussian error.\nThe simulation uses least-squares optimization for beacon localization. Figure V.1(a)\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure V.1:\n(a) Simulation setup. Big dots denote actual node/beacon location\nwhile the small dots indicate computed locations. (b) shows the behavior of beacon\nlocalization error w.r.t. the standard deviation in node location error.\nshows the 2D simulation setup while Figure V.1(b) shows the beacon localization\nerror against standard deviation in sensor node location error. Beacon localization\nerror increases at least linearly with sensor node location error. Hence, it is very\nimportant to have accurate sensor node locations for accurate operation of location-\ncritical applications.\nFormalization\nFormally, a generalized self localization problem can be deﬁned as follows. Given\nnode IDs and their ranges from each other, conjecture the relative physical location\nof each node in the network. Few anchor nodes can be provided to transform relative\nnode locations to absolute positions.\nThere are many challenges to be addressed in this problem. First we deﬁne some\nterms that we will use in the rest of the document.\nDistance Matrix\nDistance Matrix D is a matrix such that d   is the range measurement between\nnode i and node j. Distance is negative for node pairs for which range measurement\nis not known. Number of positive entries in row i represents the number of neighbors\nof node i.\nD =\nd\n. . . d\nd\n...\n...\n. . . d\n...\n. . .\nd   d\n. . .\n(V.1)\nNecessary Condition for Localization\nNecessary Condition for Localization in 3 dimensions states that a node\nshould have distance measurements with at least four non-coplanar neighbor nodes.\nFollowing ﬁgure illustrates the necessity of four non-coplanar neighbor nodes. Fig-\nure V.2 shows the locus of node location with number of neighbors. In case of one\nneighbor the locus is a sphere; for two neighbors the locus is a closed curve that is\nintersection of two spheres (a circle). For three neighbors the locus is reduced to two\npoints. We need fourth neighbor to get rid of this mirror ambiguity.\nFigure V.2: Node Locus\nMulti-path\nIn a typical urban environment many sensor nodes might not have line-of-sight\nwith the mobile beacon but they can receive the acoustic signal via multipath. These\nmultipath ranges or echoes when used for localization tend to produce false or infeasi-\nble results. Consider the following 2-dimensional example (Figure V.3) for illustration.\nSound sources S  and S  have line-of-sight with sensor node U but the direct path to\nFigure V.3: Illustration of eﬀect of echo.\nsound source S  is obstructed by wall W , thus U receives the acoustic signal from S\nvia multipath through wall W . Due to this echo the range measurement between S\nand U is d  instead of the actual value d. Based on these range measurements, node\nU   is localized away from its actual location U . If the wall W  were moved little far-\nther the echo distance d  would increase and at some point no feasible location would\nexist for node U . Similar illustration can be drawn for a 3-dimensional case. It is\nclear from the above illustration that range measurements with echoes would not only\nprevent some nodes to be localized but also—even worse—cause mis-localization.\nNotice also that the amount of echoes present in the range measurements depends\non the topology. We found no way of estimating the extent of echoes in the measure-\nment data. In typical urban environments, low network connectivity and non-uniform\nnode distribution in the vertical (Z-)direction further deteriorate the localization ac-\ncuracy. These eﬀects can cause even larger localization errors at boundary nodes.\nError Model\nFor most measuring instruments, the actual physical measurement is aﬀected by\nsome sources of errors that we call noise. The most common form of noise is the\nwhite Gaussian noise, which exhibits a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and an\ninstrument or measurement process dependent standard deviation.\nRanging measurements also show white Gaussian noise for a “near ideal” environ-\nment, like an outdoor ﬁeld where all sensor nodes have direct line of sight without\nany obstructions. Multipath propagation in urban or complex environments causes\nnon-Gaussian errors in ranging measurements.\nMost of the localization systems do not consider non-Gaussian errors in ranging\nerror distribution. Considering the non-Gaussian nature of the ranging error is essen-\ntial to solve the localization problem for satisfactory results. There are many ways\nranging error distribution can be modeled. It can be considered as non-parametric\ndistribution or as combined distribution of Gaussian and chi-squared distribution.\nThis work doesn’t directly address the error modeling problem and doesn’t explore\nthe non-Gaussian nature of ranging errors. This work does acknowledge that ranging\nare non-Gaussian, and deals with them by using a technique called pruned least-\nsquared optimization. Pruned least-squared optimization is described later in this\nchapter.\nDistance Optimization\nThe self localization problem in its most basic form can be modeled as a distance\noptimization problem. In the distance optimization problem the independent opti-\nmization variables are node locations and the non-linear objective functions are the\ndiﬀerences between distances computed from node locations and range measurements\nfor all node pairs for which range measurements exist. It can be observed that the\ndistance optimization problem is actually a function-ﬁtting problem where distances\nare the non-linear functions of node locations. Least squares optimization is known\nto work best for function-ﬁtting problems [17]. The mathematical formulation of\ndistance optimization problem is presented below.\nFind x , a global minimizer for objective function\nF (x) =\nd   − ˆd\n(V.2)\nwhere\nd   = {(x  − x )  + (y  − y )  + (z  − z ) }\nis the computed distance between nodes i and j, and ˆd   is the measured distance.\nThe optimization variable is x = [x y z x y z  . . . x y z ]  where [x y z ] is the 3D\ncoordinate of node i.\nThe non-linear objective function F (x) is the square sum of distance errors for\nall pairs (i, j) for which range measurement exists ( ˆd   ≥ 0). The components of the\noptimization variable x are subjected to the boundary value constraints.\nx    ≤ x  ≤ x\ny    ≤ y  ≤ y\nz    ≤ z  ≤ z\n(V.3)\nPruned Distance Optimization\nAs mentioned in section V we have non-Gaussian error in the form of echoes\nin range measurements. In least-square optimization terminology these echo ranges\nare outliers that tend to shift the least-square model from the actual model. It is\nlogical not to consider these outliers in optimization. For this reason the optimization\nproblem described in previous section is modiﬁed to account for probable outliers. The\ndeﬁnition of the new optimization problem requires an operator min which is deﬁned\nbelow.\nOperator min\nDefinition 1. Let f  be a list of N function evaluations (or numbers), then min f\nis the list of dpN e-many smallest function evaluations (or numbers) where d e\nis ceiling operator and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1.\nDefinition 2. Let\nf  be a series sum of N function evaluations (or numbers),\nthen\nmin f  is the series sum of dpN e-many smallest function evaluations\nwhere d e is ceiling operator and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1.\nThe mathematical formulation of the new distance optimization problem is presented\nbelow.\nFind x , a global minimizer for\nF (x) =\nmin\nd   − ˆd\n(V.4)\nwhere ˆd   and d   are the range measurement and distance computed from localized\nnodes i and j and optimization variable is x = [x y z x y z  . . . x y z ] .\nIf the optimizer x is close to global optimizer x  then all function evaluations\nbut those corresponding to echoes will be close to zero.\nIn other words, near the\nglobal minimizer all consistent range measurements will have function evaluations\nwith values close to zero while echoes, which are non-consistent range measurements,\nwill produce function evaluations with larger values.\nLeast-square optimization works best if the errors have Gaussian distribution.\nWhen we discard few largest function evaluations using the min operator, we are\ndiscarding the most signiﬁcant outliers in the distribution and hence obtaining an\napproximate Gaussian distribution. Figure V.4 illustrates pruned optimization ap-\nFigure V.4: Illustration of pruned least square optimization\nproach for a line ﬁtting problem. In Figure V.4(a) all the data points are considered\nin optimization. The resulting curve is highly oﬀset from the actual curve due to the\nnon-Gaussian errors. In Figure V.4(b) data points with large deviations from opti-\nmized solution are removed from computation and curve is re-optimized for remaining\ndata points. Figure V.4(c) and (d) show the subsequent steps; the ﬁnal solution is\nvery close to the actual curve.\nPenalty Functions\nThe standard optimization solvers used in this work were designed for uncon-\nstrained optimization. The bounded-value constraints on the optimization variables\nare incorporated separately by modeling them as penalty functions in the objective\nfunction. Penalty functions incorporate a penalty value if variables go out of bound.\nThe most intuitive form of a penalty function is a rectangular penalty wherein\na constant high penalty is incorporated if the variable goes out of bounds. For op-\ntimization purposes rectangular penalty does not provide motivation (descent direc-\ntion) for the variable to fall within bounds. Other forms of penalty functions are\nlinear or quadratic penalties which grow linearly or quadratically with the oﬀset from\nthe bounds. Logarithmic penalty functions are most suitable for bounded-value con-\nstraints because of their sudden descent near boundary values. Figure V.5 shows the\nFigure V.5: Penalty functions\ncomparison of diﬀerent penalty functions. The least-square optimization problem for\npenalty functions is deﬁned below.\nFind x , a global minimizer for\nF (x) =\n{κ · ln(1 + ∆x    )}\n(V.5)\nwhere κ is penalty constant and ∆x     is the oﬀset from feasible boundary,\n∆x     =\n|x  − x   |\nif x  < x\nif x    ≤ x  ≤ x\n(V.6)\n|x  − x   |\nif x  > x\nand optimization variable x = [x y z x y z  . . . x y z ] .\nComposition Of Least-Square Optimization Problems\nTwo or more least-square optimization problems can be composed as follows.\nConsider two least-square optimization problems P  and P  on optimization variable\nx and objective functions\nf (x) and\ng (x) then the combined least-square\noptimization problem P on variable x have the objective function\nF  (x) =\nf (x) +\ng (x)\n(V.7)\nCHAPTER VI\nLOCALIZATION ALGORITHM\nAn obvious and straightforward localization algorithm would be to solve for all\nunknown node locations simultaneously (Algorithm 1).\nAlgorithm 1 Self localization algorithm\nConsider 3D coordinates of all unknown nodes in optimization\nvariable.\nConstruct and solve non-linear least-square optimization problem\nwith objective function in equation (V.2).\nThis approach has some serious disadvantages. Convergence of the optimization\nproblem strongly depends upon the initial guess given to the solver. A close-to-\noptimum initial guess would converge to global optimum in considerably less time\nwhile a bad initial guess for the same problem might end up in local optima. Initial\nestimates for nodes can be computed by using an extension of the bounding box\ntechnique described in [3]. But due to the large size of the sensor network and\nrelatively few randomly distributed anchor nodes, it is possible that we do not have\ngood initial estimates for the whole network but only for the part close to the anchors.\nIterative Incremental Localization Algorithm\nAn iterative incremental approach wherein a part of the network near anchor\nnodes is localized ﬁrst and then the node locations are propagated further seems\nsuitable. The idea here is to iteratively select and localize a part of network (a\nsub-system) for which a good initial estimate is available. At each iteration the\npart of the network selected for localization will grow, consisting of nodes that are\nalready localized and few unknown neighboring nodes that have better estimates\nin the current iteration.\nIn each iteration ranges that are believed to be echoes\nare identiﬁed and removed from computation. The algorithm is presented below\n(Algorithm 2). Symbol x represents the 3D location vector of nodes, x    and x\ndenotes estimated and localized node location vectors respectively. N denotes the set\nof nodes in the network and η (described in section sub-system evaluation later in\nthis chapter) denotes conﬁdence value for the localization.\nAlgorithm 2 Incremental iterative self localization algorithm\nx    ← 0, x    ← 0\nfor run = 1 to run    do\nConfigure parameters, read distance matrix d, set sub-system\n˜N ← ∅\nrepeat\n← x ∈ B  ∀i ∈ N − ˜N    based on neighbor polling\nsatisfies goodness ∀i ∈ ˜N\n˜N    ← ˜N\nEstimate bounding-box B  ∀i ∈ N\nChoose x\nSelect ˜N ⊆ N such that x\nOptimize x for sub-system ˜N\nx    ← x\nfor all i ∈ ˜N do\nCompute η\n˜N    ← ∅\nif η  acceptable then\nx\n← x\n˜N    ← ˜N    ∪ {i}\nend for\nOutput x\nend if\nend for\nuntil ˜N    − ˜N    = ∅\nThere are two levels of looping in the algorithm. The outer loop starts with an\nestimate, x    for the whole network. The ﬁrst run of the outer loop starts with a\nrandom (or user given) estimate. Each run afterward starts with the ﬁnal estimate\nof the previous run. The inner loop corresponds to the incremental selection and\nlocalization of a sub-system, ˜N , that we will call an iteration. At each iteration, the\nselected sub-system will increase in size, more nodes will be localized with higher\naccuracy until there are no more nodes to be localized or no more nodes can be\nlocalized (i.e. the necessary condition for localization does not hold). Later sections\ndescribe each step of the algorithm in detail.\nSub-System Selection\nEach node is represented by a bounded-box with lower and upper bounds (x  , x  ).\nThe node coordinates can take any value in the closed interval [x   x  ]. Since anchor\nnodes are known with high accuracy, their bounding-box is very small. Initially, the\nbounding-boxes for all unknown nodes can be set to the size of the ﬁeld and can be\nupdated using range measurements ˆd   between node i and its neighbors j.\nx     = min\n{(x     − ˆd   · 1), x    }\nx     = min\n{(x     + ˆd   · 1), x    }\n(VI.1)\n(VI.2)\nThe order in which bounding-box updates should be done is also important. Con-\nsidering the sensor network as a graph, it turns out that a variant of the topological\nsorting (Algorithm 3) on the network graph will provide the required node ordering.\nThe main idea in this algorithm is that unknown nodes that are closer to known\nAlgorithm 3 Topological sort\nSet known neighbor index, κ = ∞ for anchors and κ = 0 for all\nother vertices\nwhile Graph not empty do\nend while\nFind a vertex u with highest κ[u]\nOutput u\nDelete all edges e = (u, v) of u, increment κ[v] by 1\nDelete u from graph\nnodes get higher precedence.\nFor node i that already has an estimate x\nand conﬁdence value η , the bounds\nare set as follows. Conﬁdence values for node location estimates are computed in the\nsub-system evaluation section which is described later.\nx     = max{(x\n− η  · 1), x    }\nx     = min{(x\n+ η  · 1), x    }\n(VI.3)\n(VI.4)\nFor all other nodes a location estimate is picked from the bounding-box. The most\nobvious way would be to pick the center of the box but a more heuristic method\ninvolving bounding-box partitioning is used instead. The bounding-box of a node, if\nlarger than a critical size, is partitioned into smaller boxes and neighbors are polled\nfor the partition in which the node is most likely to be present. The center of that\npartition is assumed to be the estimated location for that node. A polling index C  is\ncomputed for each partition p, which is essentially a weighted sum of distance errors\nfor all neighbors j of node i.\nC  =\nx  − x\n− ˆd\n· η\n(VI.5)\nwhere x  is the center point of partition p. The center point of the partition with\nminimum polling index is chosen as estimated location for that node.\nA part of the network is selected based the following notion of goodness of esti-\nmated node locations. An estimated location for node i is considered good if the node\nhas at least three neighbors and it’s bounding-box satisﬁes two properties. First, its\nvolume V  is smaller than a critical volume V and second, its aspect ratio α  is greater\nthan a critical ¯α        . Aspect ratio α  is a measure of cubeness of the bounding-box.\nα  is expressed in terms of bounding-box volume V , space diagonal d  and surface\narea A  as,\n√\n3 · V\nA  · d\nα  =\n(VI.6)\nNotice that for nodes with small bounding-boxes an estimate is acceptable even if it\nhas smaller aspect ratio. For this reason the critical aspect ratio is made adaptive,\nquadratically depending on the bounding-box volume. In the equation below ¯α\nand ¯α    are constants.\n¯α         = ¯α    −\n− 1\nV\nV\n· (¯α    − ¯α   )\n(VI.7)\nSub-System Localization\nThe distance optimization problem for the selected sub-system is solved in multiple\nstages. At each stage the solution is moved closer to the optima.\nWe solve the objective function in Equation (V.4) or the combination of objective\nfunction in Equations (V.4) and (V.5) at each stage. The solution from the previous\nstage is used as a starting point for the current stage. At the end of each stage\nsome range measurements that are believed to have non-Gaussian errors (echoes) are\nidentiﬁed and removed from the distance matrix. The diﬀerent stages of sub-system\nlocalization are described below.\n• Stage I. At this stage echo ranges are identiﬁed and discarded based on the\nevaluation of the objective function in Equation (V.4) at the current optimizer\nx   .\n• Stage II. At this stage of the optimization problem, Equation (V.4) is opti-\nmized in a ﬁxed number of iterations. The solver is stopped even if the optimizer\nhas not converged. Let us visualize this stage as a 3D earth terrain optimization\nproblem where x and y directions are optimization variables and altitude from\nsea-level i.e. z is the optimization function. The global optimization in this\nproblem is looking for the deepest trench on terrain. Optimizing for a ﬁxed\nnumber of iterations can be visualized as going downwards a local trench but\nnot going all the way down because that would take unlimited amount of time.\n• Stage III. At the previous stage we did not consider bounded-value constraints\non the optimization variable. The variable might go out of the feasible region as\nguided by the objective function. In this stage the combination of the optimiza-\ntion problems, Equations (V.4) and (V.5) are optimized in a ﬁxed number of\niterations. The objective function in Equation (V.5) ensures that the variable\nwill fall within the feasible region. The reason for having stage II separate from\nstage III is that there exist a possibility that the path to the global optimizer\ngoes through a region that might not be part of the feasible region. Figure VI.1\nshows a case when such a path exists. The optimization variable from initial\nFigure VI.1: An example optimization landscape. −2 ≤ x ≤ 1 and −1 ≤ y ≤ 2 is\nthe feasible region.\nguess X will optimize to A while the global optimum is at P . But if we use two\nstage optimization the optimizer will converge to P .\n• Stage IV. This ﬁnal stage is similar to stage III except parameter p in Equation\n(V.4) is set to 1.0, i.e. no pruning of the distance matrix is done. It is expected\nthat by the end of stage III we would have discarded most signiﬁcant echo\nmeasurements.\nSub-System Evaluation\nAn important measure for any algorithm is its performance metric.\nIn case of\nself localization the metric can be deﬁned as the closeness of the computed locations\nto ground truth (actual node locations); we call this the localization error. Since in\npractical scenarios the ground truth is not known, it would be very helpful if there\nwas an indirect performance metric that correlates with the localization error.\nThe quality of computed locations produced by the solver is evaluated using a\nmeasure called the conﬁdence value. The conﬁdence value is an indicator of uncer-\ntainty in node location around the current location estimate.\nThe algorithm to compute conﬁdence value is the following. Compute the ranges\nbetween computed node locations for all node pairs for which measured range exist.\nNext compute the deviation of these computed ranges from measured ranges. Now\nfor each node i we have a deviation vector ∆  whose elements are the deviations\nof computed ranges from measured ranges for all its neighbors. A large value in\n∆  indicate that either (1) the node location is incorrect or (2) the corresponding\nrange measurement is incorrect. If the node location is incorrect then most of the\nelements of ∆  should be large. If only a few range measurements are incorrect then\nthe mean and the variance of ∆  should be small except for those incorrect range\nmeasurements. Practically, all node locations are categorized based on mean µ  and\nstandard deviation σ  in ∆ . The categorization of node locations is described below.\nConﬁdence value η  is computed as σ  exp(|µ |).\nFigure VI.2: Categorization of computed locations based on computed errors. Thin\nlines show the error distribution while dash-dotted line indicates the mean and grey\nshaded region show the standard deviation. The dashed line is the zero mean.\n1. If both µ  and σ  are close to zero then the node location is correct.\n2. If µ  is close to zero but σ  is large then either the range deviations are spread\naround zero or few large deviations caused σ  to be large. We say that the node\nlocation may be aﬀected by echo. In this case we remove few data points with\nlarge deviations and re-categorize the location based on a recomputed mean\nand standard deviation.\n3. If |µ | is large but σ  is small then all elements of ∆  are large i.e. the node\nlocation is deﬁnitely incorrect.\n4. If both |µ | and σ  are large then again location might be aﬀected by echo and\nwe follow the same procedure as we followed in case 2 above.\n5. If |µ | and σ  are neither large nor small then location correctness is undecided.\nWe follow the same procedure here as we followed in case 2 and 4.\nThe threshold values for mean, µ and standard deviation, σ are set depending on the\nrequired localization accuracy. For sub-meter localization, minimum and maximum\nmean can be 0.05 m and 0.30 m respectively. The minimum and maximum standard\ndeviation can be around 0.15 m and 0.8 m. The above values were used to evaluate the\nalgorithm on simulated topologies, described in next chapter. Figure VI.2 shows the\ncharacteristics of each of the above category. Node locations categorized as incorrect\nor as echoes are considered not localized.\nCHAPTER VII\nIMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS\nWe implemented the proposed localization algorithm in MATLAB and ran it with\nsimulated sensor network topologies and ranging data. The Levenberg-Marquardt\nsolver was used for optimization in MATLAB.\nSimulated Data Generation\nThe network topologies and ranging data for localization algorithm were generated\nin a Java based simulator. The Java simulator generates node locations on sensor\nnetwork ﬁeld. The simulator also generates sound source locations arranged on a\npath. The separation between two consecutive sound source locations is bounded.\nThis simulates the movement of a mobile acoustic beacon that has speciﬁed speed\nand sound signal emitting rate. The simulator then generates ranges between sound\nsources and nodes in its vicinity. Gaussian noise is added to the ranges according\nto the experimental observation in Figure IV.4 (Eqn. IV.1). Non-Gaussian errors or\nechoes and negative-echoes are also added to the ranging data according to the trend\nobserved in experimental data. Experiments show that the probability of a range\nbeing an echo grows with the range. The extent of echo, which is the deviation of\necho range from actual value, depends entirely on the environment.\nThe simulator takes number of sensor nodes, number of anchor nodes, number of\nacoustic beacon paths and number of sound sources on each path as input parame-\nters. Other adjustable parameters include sensor network ﬁeld size, maximum and\nminimum separation of consecutive sound sources and maximum range of acoustic\nsignal.\nFigure VII.1: XY view of a typical sensor network topology.\nA topology of 50 sensor node locations was generated randomly in a 100 × 100 ×\n20 m ﬁeld with at least half of the nodes on ground level. 80 sound sources were\ngenerated on four random paths such that the separation between successive sound\nsources is bounded (0 − 8 m). Also, the Z variation of the sources was limited to 2 m\nto simulate a mobile beacon, which is moving on the ground in the sensor ﬁeld. This\nconstraint can be relaxed if we consider mobile beacons to be on a UAV that can vary\nits altitude. Maximum acoustic range was set to 30 m which is in accordance with\nour experimental observations. Five sensor nodes were assumed to be known anchor\nlocations. Two diﬀerent ranging data sets, one with echoes and another one without\nechoes, were generated for same topology. Figure VII.1 shows XY view of a typical\nsensor network topology. Faint dashed lines indicate range measurements. Simulated\nranging errors are shown in Figure VII.2. Note that the standard deviation in ranging\nerror increases with ranges. Number of non-Gaussian errors also increases with range.\nFigure VII.2: Simulated ranging errors\nThe ranging data generated by the simulator closely emulates the behavior of actual\nacoustic ranging.\nResults\nIn the presence of ground truth, the performance of the algorithm can be evaluated\nusing localization error which is the diﬀerence between computed locations and the\nground truth. Localization error for node i is,\n= (x  − ˜x )  + (y  − ˜y )  + (z  − ˜z )\nσ\n(VII.1)\nwhere x , y  and z  are the computed coordinates of node i, and ˜x , ˜y  and ˜z  are the\ntrue location coordinates of the same node. Figure VII.3 and Figure VII.4 compare\nthe computed node locations to their true locations in XY and XZ views for ranging\ndata with echoes. Diﬀerent solid lines show multiple paths of the sound source. Solid\narrows in Figure VII.3 indicate the sensor nodes that have the highest localization\nerror. Notice that all such nodes are very far from their nearest sound source.\nFigure VII.3: Comparison of computed node locations to their true values in XY\nplane for ranging data w/ echoes.\nFigures VII.5 and VII.6 show the histograms of 3D localization error without and\nwith simulated echoes respectively.

In other words, more nodes were localized\nwith better accuracy when we did not have echoes in ranging data.\n(b)\nFigure VII.4: Comparison of computed node locations to their true values in XZ\nplane for ranging data w/ echoes.\nFrom Figures VII.5 and VII.6 we can see that the computed locations of sound\nsources are more accurate than that of sensor nodes. This high accuracy can be\nattributed to the topological fact that sensor nodes are distributed around the sound\nsources. For node localization application we are actually not concerned about the\ncomputed sound source locations. However, it is an important observation, that if we\ndistribute the sound sources uniformly around sensor nodes then we can get higher\nlocalization accuracy for the sensors.\nThe localization evaluation scheme described in chapter VI was used to evaluate\nand categorize localization results. Figure VII.7 shows number of sensor nodes in\neach category. The ﬁgure shows localization error distribution for each category. As\nexpected, most of the nodes under correct localization category have small localization\nerror. The categorization algorithm was able to identify four incorrect localization\nresults, two of them have location error less than 1.0 m. Few localization results\ncase (a)\nFigure VII.5: Histograms of 3D localization error for all sensor nodes and sound\nsources without echoes in ranging data.\ncase (b)\nFigure VII.6: Histograms of 3D localization error for all sensor nodes and sound\nsources with echoes in ranging data.\nwith high location errors were categorized as others. Nodes that were classiﬁed under\naﬀected-by-echo category have 1.0 m or more location error.\nSub-meter localization accuracy is a requirement for correct operation of shooter-\nlocalization application. An important concern for node localization is the identiﬁca-\ntion of nodes with high location error. The algorithm localized approximately 75% of\nthe nodes with sub-meter accuracy and less than 5 m maximum error for simulated\nsensor networks. The categorization scheme identiﬁed approximately 50% of the node\nlocations with 2 m or m",

For example, cells that\nselect an abnormal fate in a developing ﬁeld are frequently removed by apoptosis. An important issue in this\nprocess that needs to be resolved is the mechanism used by cells to discern their correct fate from an abnormal\nfate. In order to examine this issue, we developed an animal model that expresses the dioxin receptor homolog\nSpineless (Ss) ectopically in the Drosophila wing. The presence of mosaic clones ectopically expressing ss results\nin a local transformation of organ identity, homeosis, from wing into a leg or antenna. The cells with\nmisspeciﬁed fates subsequently activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase to undergo apoptosis in an autonomous or\nnonautonomous manner depending on their position within the wing, suggesting that a cell-cell interaction is,\nat least in some cases, involved in the detection of misspeciﬁed cells. Similar position dependence is commonly\nobserved when various homeotic genes controlling the body segments are ectopically expressed. The autono-\nmous and nonautonomous apoptosis caused by ss is regulated by a novel leucine-rich repeat family trans-\nmembrane protein, Fish-lips (Fili) that interacts with surrounding normal cells. These data support a mech-\nanism in which the lack of some membrane proteins helps to recognize the presence of different cell types and\ndirect these cells to an apoptotic fate in order to exclude them from the normal developing ﬁeld.\nSignals that regulate cell growth, patterning, and apoptosis\nare interdependent during development (1, 19, 29, 37). In\nparticular, there are likely to be multiple ways to elicit an\napoptotic cell fate since apoptosis serves a variety of functions\nin multicellular organisms (29). In regard to the cell autonomy\nof apoptosis, a cell-autonomous apoptosis occurs during cell\ncompetition, a phenomenon whereby cells that grow slowly due\nto the mutation of essential genes such as Minute or ras are\nremoved later in development (39, 40, 49, 56). In contrast, it\nhas been reported that nonautonomous cell death is often\nassociated with cell fate changes by altering the morphogen\nactivities (2, 3) of Decapentaplegic (Dpp) (32, 41) or Wingless\n(Wg) (42, 60). In these cases, apoptotic cell death occurs both\nwithin and outside of the abnormal cell population and is\nreferred to as morphogenetic apoptosis. Similarly, when spalt\n(sal), a target gene of the Dpp signal, is ectopically expressed\napoptosis is induced through interaction with the surrounding\nnormal cells (38). Thus, the removal of physiologically abnor-\nmal cells by apoptosis can occur by more than one mechanism,\nalthough the details of the various processes remain to be\nelucidated. In order to search for and analyze the ways to\nremove other types of abnormal cell, we have ectopically ex-\npressed various master genes, including homeotic genes, to\ncreate cell populations with developmentally abnormal fates.\nIn most cases, cells with abnormal fate induced severe apopto-\nsis in a cell autonomous or nonautonomous manner. Among\nthese, we focus on the master gene ss, of which overexpression\nin the wing changes the organ identity into a ventral appendage\nsuch as a leg or antenna.\nBased on sequence identity and splice site conservation, Ss is\nthe closest Drosophila homolog of the mammalian dioxin re-\nceptor (arylhydrocarbon receptor [Ahr]) (17, 27). Both mam-\nmalian and Drosophila proteins can also bind to the xenotoxin\nresponsive element (XRE) and stimulate transcription from\ngenes containing this cis-acting element (18). Although Ss has\nnot been shown to bind to arylhydrocarbons, it regulates nor-\nmal morphogenesis of the leg or antenna and bristles, all of\nwhich are major Drosophila sensor organs or tissues that re-\nspond to environmental chemicals.\nOur results reveal that ectopic ss provokes a wing-to-leg\nand/or antenna homeosis that subsequently elicits apoptosis in\nan autonomous or nonautonomous manner. This apoptotic\nresponse is regulated by a novel transmembrane leucine-rich\nrepeat (LRR) protein, Fili, and may be a common process\ninduced by ectopic expression of various homeotic genes.\nThese results indicate that homeosis elicits a complex set of\nsignals that inﬂuence the survival of the transformed cells and\ntheir surrounding cells.

         "ISCUSSION\nEctopic ss induces a homeosis-dependent apoptosis that\nmay cause a rare frequency of wing-to-leg transdetermination.\nHomeosis is a naturally occurring rare phenomenon with for-\nmation of a local body part having characteristics that are\nnormally found in a related part at another location in the\nbody. This phenomenon had been studied exclusively in Dro-\nsophila melanogaster but can also be found in a variety of\ninsects and other organisms (53). Although homeosis is rarely\nfound in wild-type ﬂies, transdetermination, a similar phenom-\nenon, can be easily induced by in vivo culture and subsequent\ntransplantation of imaginal discs between different individuals\nor by directly manipulating functions of various master and/or\nhomeotic genes. Although such developmentally abnormal\ncells occurring in homeosis might a priori be expected to be\nremoved during development to guarantee normal morpho-\ngenesis, apoptosis has not been previously observed to accom-\npany homeosis. Our results suggest that the cells undergoing\nhomeosis do in fact induce apoptotic responses to help prevent\nthem from developing abnormal structures. The rare fre-\nquency in wing-to-leg transdetermination, which was observed\nabout 30 years ago (30), may be derived partly from the high\nfrequency of apoptosis associated with this particular transfor-\nmation.\nss-induced autonomous apoptosis is related to cell compe-\ntition. Cell competition is a phenomenon whereby cell clones\nwith a slow growth rate are eliminated during development.\nThe autonomous cell death in cell competition has been dem-\nonstrated to be caused by an impaired reception of extracel-\nlular survival factors. As representative examples, clones with\ncells heterozygous for the M(2)60E mutation show an auton-\nomous death as a result of reduced Dpp reception (40). Thus,\nthe autonomous death in ss-overexpressing cells in the wing\nblade might be a type of cell competition response. In this case,\nhowever, the extracellular factor that the ss-overexpressing\ncells fail to receive is not likely to be Dpp, since we observed\nthat the Dpp signaling level is not strongly affected in the\nss-overexpressing cells (see Fig. S1A and B in the supplemental\nmaterial). Also, ss-overexpressing cells can be removed from\nthe lateral region of the wing blade where the level of Dpp\nsignaling is normally low. In contrast, cells heterozygous for\nM(2)60E can survive in this area due to the loss of competition\nfor Dpp (40). Therefore, Wg or other extracellular survival\nfactors might be affecting the survival of ss-overexpressing\ncells, as discussed below.\nPosition-dependent variance in cell autonomy is found in\nthe apoptotic response to ss overexpression. We have not yet\naddressed the question of why the variance in cell autonomy of\nss-induced apoptosis is related to dorsoventral patterning or\nblade/hinge subdomains. However, the variance suggests an\ninteresting model in which signals that normally regulate dor-\nsoventral appendage patterning or blade/hinge subdomains\nalso directly affect the apoptotic response or speciﬁcation of\norgan identity as cryptic mechanisms. Interestingly, ectopic\nexpression of most of the segment-specifying homeotic genes\ncommonly shows a similar position-dependent variance in cell\nautonomy (Fig. 5). In this view, Wg, the morphogen controlling\nthe dorsoventral patterning (42, 60), or Vg, the selector of wing\nsubdomain (31, 34), may be involved in the regulation of po-\nsition-dependent variance in the cell autonomy of apoptosis.\nHowever, deﬁnitively demonstrating the involvement of Wg or\nVg is difﬁcult because changing Wg signal or Vg activity alone\nalso induces a severe unrelated apoptosis (2).

A\nrecent study concerning the relation of apoptosis in sal-over-\nexpressing cells and LRR family proteins Caps/Trn has pro-\nvided a new insights into how cell survival of misspeciﬁed cells\nis controlled (38). Cells that overexpress sal lack caps/trn ex-\npression and are removed from the area where sal is not\nnormally expressed. However, cells expressing both sal and\ncaps can survive.

         "Two variants of the renal Na -K -Cl  cotransporter (NKCC2),\ncalled NKCC2A and NKCC2F, display marked differences in Na ,\nRb , and Cl  affinities, yet are identical to one another except for a\n23-residue membrane-associated domain that is derived from alter-\nnatively spliced exons. The proximal portion of these exons is pre-\ndicted to encode the second transmembrane domain (tm2) in the\nform of an -helix, and the distal portion, part of the following\nconnecting segment (cs1a). In recent studies, we have taken advan-\ntage of the A–F differences in kinetic behavior to determine which\nregions in tm2-cs1a are involved in ion transport. Functional char-\nacterizations of chimeras in which tm2 or cs1a were interchanged\nbetween the variants showed that both regions are important in\nspecifying ion affinities, but did not allow delineating the contribu-\ntion of individual residues. Here, we have extended these structure-\nfunction analyses by studying additional mutants in which variant\nresidues between A and F were interchanged individually in the\ntm2-cs1a region (amino acid number 216, 220, 223, 229, or 233 in\nNKCC2). None of the substitutions were found to affect K       ,\nsuggesting that the affinity difference for anion transport is con-\nveyed by a combination of variant residues in this domain. However,\n2 substitutions in the tm2 of F were found to affect cation constants\nspecifically; interestingly, one of these mutations (residue 216) only\naffected K        while the other (residue 220) only affected\nK       . We have thus identified two novel residues in NKCC2 that\nplay a key role in cation transport. Because such residues should be\nadjacent to one another on the vertical axis of the tm2 -helix, our\nresults imply, furthermore, that the ion transport sites in NKCC2\ncould be physically linked.\nThe second isoform of the Na -K -Cl  cotransporter (NKCC2)  is\nconfined to the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb of Henle,\nwhere it promotes substantial NaCl reabsorption (1– 4). Alternative\nsplicing of the primary transcript leads to the formation of three variants\n(called NKCC2B, -A, and -F) that are identical to one another except for\nthe exon 4-encoding region, which corresponds to the second trans-\nmembrane domain (tm2) and part of the following connecting segment\n(cs1a). Interestingly, these variants are distributed differentially along\nthe thick ascending limb as follows: B is in macula densa cells, A in the\nouter medullary stripe, and F in the inner medullary stripe (6, 7). In\ncontrast to NKCC2, the first isoform of NKCC (NKCC1) is widely dis-\ntributed, arising in non-polarized cells as well as in the basolateral pole\nof many secretory epithelia (8 –12).\nThe main function of both NKCC1 and NKCC2 is to couple the\nmovement of Na -K -Cl  across the cell surface. Based on various\nstudies, the stoichiometry of ion transport has been shown to be 1Na :\n1K :2Cl , implying that there is no net movement of charge during the\ntranslocation cycle (13–15). In some studies, however, alternate trans-\nport modes have been proposed, e.g. 2Na :1K :3Cl  for squid NKCC1\n(16), 1Na :1K :1Cl  for NKCC2A (17, 18), and K /K  exchange for\nboth NKCC1 and NKCC2A (17–19). We and others have hypothesized\nthat large differences in Cl  affinities between the 2 Cl  binding sites\ncould account for the apparent 1Na :1K :1Cl  stoichiometry (17, 18),\nand incomplete reactions during the transport cycle, for the Na -inde-\npendent exchange mode (18 –19).\nThe kinetic characteristics of NKCC1 vary widely among species and\nthose of NKCC2, among the splice variants; for example, ion constants\nare lower for human NKCC1 compared with shark (sa) NKCC1 (9,\n22–26), and lower in NKCC2A compared with F (17, 18, 27, 28). In\nprevious work, we have exploited such differences to identify residues\nthat are involved in ion movement by the transporters. Indeed, struc-\nture-function studies of wild-type and chimeric NKCCs have shown\nthat the kinetic characteristics of these proteins are specified, at least in\npart, by variant residues that are localized in the tm2 and/or cs1a regions\n(18, 22–25). Interestingly, such studies have also led to the identification\nof a high affinity-Cl  binding site in cs1a.\nChimera approaches can be used quite effectively to identify variant\nresidues that convey differences in the operations of homologous carri-\ners. The main disadvantage of such studies is that key residues will be\nmissed if they are fully conserved between the carriers. This limitation is\nillustrated by recent analyses in which the behavior of various chimeras\nled to slightly different interpretations of where affinity-modifying\ndomains are localized depending on which NKCC was used to gen-\nerate the mutants. Based on these analyses, for instance, it was not\npossible to determine whether the cs1a region of NKCC1 is involved\nin ion transport (18, 22–25).\nThe NKCC ion binding sites are known to be functionally interde-\npendent; that is, a change in ion affinity at one site induces a change in\nion affinity at another site (18 –21). One implication of this character-\nistic is that it could be difficult to determine which ion constants are\nmodified directly as a result of a residue substitution. Fortunately, we\nhave recently determined the manner in which these constants are\ninterrelated based on kinetic studies of wild-type NKCC1 expressed in\nHEK-293 cells (24, 25). These data, which were analyzed in the context\nof previous kinetic models (19 –21), indicate that at high extracellular\n(o) [Na ] or [K ], changes in either Na  or K  affinity will have small\neffects on K       , whereas at high [Cl ] , a change in Cl  affinity will\nhave a larger effect on K        and K       .\nOne of the structure-function studies that was discussed above led to\nthe identification of five candidate residues in tm2-cs1a that play a def-\ninite role in Cl  transport by NKCC2, but the same degree of resolution\nconcerning the structural determinants of cation transport was not\nobtained (18). The approach that was used here was valuable in this\nregard, allowing us to uncover two residues that are important in deter-\nmining Na  and Rb  affinities. Quite interestingly, our kinetic studies\nalso suggest that the residues identified belong to distinct ion binding\nsites in the tm2-cs1 region.\nOverview—Structure-function studies were carried out to identify\naffinity-modifying residues in the tm2-cs1a region of Squalus acanthias\n(sa) NKCC2A and saNKCC2F (called saA and saF in this work). Mutant\nsaNKCC2A and saNKCCF were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes\nand characterized through flux assays. Unless mentioned otherwise,\nchemicals, reagents, and kits were from different suppliers or collabo-\nrators.\ncDNAs—A total of 10 different cDNA constructs were used in these\nassays. They were subcloned in Pol1, a X. laevis oocyte expression vec-\ntor that is derived from pGEM and that contains the T7 promoter, a\nmultiple cloning site flanked by the X. laevis -globin untranslated\nregions and a poly(A) tract (17, 18, 29, 30). All of the constructs were\npropagated in XL1-blue cells (Stratagene) and purified on silica-based\ncolumns (Qiagen).\nsaA, saF, saA/F, and saF/A—These constructs were generated in pre-\nvious studies but were not recharacterized for this analysis (18). They\ncorrespond to wild-type saA and saF, and to a pair of complementary\nchimeras in which tm2 or cs1a was interchanged between saA and saF.\nThese chimeras are called saA/F (tm2 from A, cs1a from F) and saF/A\n(tm2 from F, cs1a from A). The wild-type saA and the tm2-cs1a regions\nof saA, saF, saA/F, and saF/A are represented in Fig. 1 through hydrop-\nathy plot models to illustrate how they differ between each other and to\nshow where the junction point of the chimeras occur, thereby providing\na rationale for the choice of substitutions that were created in the cur-\nrent work.\nsaF       ,\nsaF       ,\nsaA       ,\nsaA       ,\nsaA       ,\nsaF       ,\nsaA       , saF       , saA       , and saF       —These constructs con-\nsist of saA or saF inserts in which one of the tm2-cs1a codons was\ninterchanged between the variants. All of the mutations were generated\nthrough pairs of mutagenic oligonucleotides (Sigma) using the\nQuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting constructs\nwere called saA    or saF   , where A and F indicate the NKCC2 variant\nin which the residue was substituted, and x, the substitution that was\ngenerated based on the amino acid number in saNKCC2. The muta-\ngenic oligonucleotides that were used to create these mutants are shown\nin TABLE ONE, and the position of the substituted residues are also\nillustrated in Fig. 1.\nIt should be mentioned here that the choice of substitutions was not\nbased only on differences in residues between saA and saF but also on\nthe results of recent structure-function analyses that were concerned\nwith the identification of ion transport sites in both NKCC1 and -2 (18,\n22–25). In saA/F or saF/A, for example, 9 residue substitutions were\ncreated in tm2 and 5 residue substitutions in cs1a, suggesting that a\nnumber of these residues were responsible for differences in kinetic\nbehaviors between saA and saF. However, based on the behavior of\nsaNKCC1 and human (h) NKCC1 chimeras, both these carriers also\nexhibit dramatic differences in ion affinities, we had predicted that non-\nconserved residues between the two NKCC1s as well as between high\nand low affinity wild-type NKCCs (from shark, rat, rabbit, human)\nwould be important in determining cation affinities, whereas noncon-\nserved residues between high affinity and low affinity NKCC2s (from\nshark, rat, rabbit) would be important in determining anion affinity (17,\n18, 22–28). This interpretation led to the suggestion that the main affin-\nity-modifying residues in saNKCC2 would be found at position 216,\n220, 223, 229, or 233.\nExpression in X. laevis Oocytes—To obtain synthesis of saNKCC2s in\nthis system, defolliculated stage V-VI oocytes were injected with\nsaNKCC2/Pol1-derived cRNA (5–25 ng/oocyte diluted in H O) and\nmaintained for 3 days at 18 °C in Barth’s (B) medium (see TABLE TWO)\n 125   furosemide. Groups of oocytes were also injected with H O\nalone as controls.\nImmunolocalization Studies\nsaNKCC2-expressing X. laevis\nof\nOocytes—They were performed as previously described (29, 30). Here,\nthe anti-P-NKCC immunoglobulin (Ig), which is specific to the phos-\nphorylated form of various NKCCs (29, 31), and which was a gift from\nDr. B. Forbush (Yale University), was used as primary antibody, whereas\nthe goat Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit anti-IgG (Molec-\nular Probes, A11008) was used as secondary antibody.\nKinetic Studies—Ion transport rates were determined by   Rb  influx\nmeasurements at 22 °C using different types of media (shown in\nTABLE TWO). Each of these media is derived from a regular (R)\nmedium that is iso-osmolar relative to plasma for the X. laevis frog. One\nof the modified media (called R ) was obtained by adding 84 mOs\nsucrose, and the other types of media (called R ) were obtained by\nreplacing the ions of medium R with K  or N-methyl gluconate (as\n(as anion substituents).\ncation substituents) or with gluconate  SO\nBefore, the flux assay per se, furosemide was first removed through\nseveral rinses in medium R. Eggs were then subjected to two consecutive\nincubation steps: one of 60 min in medium R  to activate the cotrans-\nporter and another of 45 min in various medium R   1–2 Ci/ml\nRb   10   ouabain  250   bumetanide to measure NKCC-\nspecific accumulation of the isotope. During this second 45-min time\ninterval, transport activity versus time is in a linear range, regardless of\nthe ion concentration used. Here, the various medium R  were pro-\nduced by varying [Na ] from 0 to 87 m , [Rb ] from 0.1 to 20 m  or\n[Cl ] from 0 to 86 m  (see TABLE TWO and figure legends). Fluxes\nwere terminated with washes in a high K  medium R   10   oua-\nbain  250   bumetanide, and oocytes were transferred to 96-well\nplates (1 oocyte/well) prefilled with 2% SDS and scintillation fluid. After\na short stabilization period, accumulated   Rb  was detected with the\nTopCountNXT microplate counter (Packard).\nTo minimize cell damage during the flux assays, all of the incubation\nsteps were carried out in 12-well plates by transferring oocytes with a\nPasteur pipette from one prefilled well to another, rather than by chang-\ning the media through aspiration and refilling of the same well. To avoid\nsolution contamination, however, each of these steps was performed\nusing three different wells prefilled with the same solution, the first two\nwells to incubate oocytes for a very short period of time, and the last well\nto complete the incubation step per se (except for the final wash during\nwhich all of the incubation times were brief). With this method, we have\nfound that ion concentrations in the final incubating solutions change\nby less than 0.5%.\nIn each experiment, counts among several oocytes (generally 4 – 6)\nwere averaged and transposed into flux rates (FRs). The equation used\nfor this calculation was FRs  (counts/oocyte  [  Rb ] in the flux\nsolution)  ([counts] in the flux solution  time of incubation in the\nflux solution), assuming that mean membrane surface areas between\ngroups of stage V-VI oocytes are very similar; for kinetic determinations\n(see below), mean FRs were also normalized to those obtained at the\nhighest ion concentration. All of these mean normalized or non-nor-\nmalized values were subsequently reaveraged from several replicate\nexperiments (n  2–5), and the data obtained were expressed as\nmean  S.E.\nIon constants (expressed as K ) and closeness of fits were calculated\nwith the programs PLOT (Biff Forbush) or SigmaPlot 4.00 for Windows\nusing the Michaelis-Menten equation (for a one binding site model), the\nHill equation with a coefficient (n) of 2 (for a two binding site model), or\nthe Hill equation with an undetermined value of n. In each case, least\nsquare analyses were carried out with a 3 or 4parameter equation (vari-\n Hill) to allow a 0 offset, assuming that   Rb\nables: V   , K , and V\ninflux is never completely absent even if one of the cotransported ions is\nremoved from the flux solution (as occurs when the transporter is in the\nK /K  exchange mode for example). In the current study, these kinetic\nparameters are presented as 1) averages of mean values from replicate\nexperiments (in which case differences between variables were analyzed\nthrough Student’s two tailed t-tests, assuming a null hypothesis for p\nvalues  0.05), and as 2) the results of single fits using activity versus\nconcentration data points that were also obtained by averaging mean\nvalues from replicate experiments. The latter method was employed to\nadjust for intra-experimental variability, which could introduce system-\natic errors, and because it is not possible to obtain time-matched data\nfor all of the conditions tested. The types of calculations carried out, and\nvariables that were used are specified further in the legends of tables or\nfigures.\nLast of all, it should be noted that kinetic parameters were calculated\nwithout subtracting bumetanide-sensitive   Rb  influxes measured in\nH 0-injected eggs. In fact, these eggs exhibit very low levels of   Rb\ninfluxes under the experimental conditions used for the flux assays (17,\n18, 29, 30). Hence, the dependence of saNKCC2 activity on [Na ],\n[Rb ], or [Cl ] should remain unaltered whether this background activ-\nity is subtracted or not from the total counts. As will be discussed later,\nprevious studies have confirmed this prediction on multiple occasions\neven for heterologously expressed carriers with transport activities that\nwere as low as 3-fold above background.\nPreamble—Throughout the following sections, the kinetic behaviors\nof our 10 mutants will be compared with those of four other carriers\n(saA, saF, saA/F, and saF/A) that were tested in a previous study using\nthe same expression system (18). We elected not to repeat previous\ncharacterizations for the following reasons. 1) We have observed that",

         "Techniques\nIn a plant–pathogen interaction where the result is disease, the\ndetection and quantification of pathogen biomass in the plants is\ncrucial. Traditionally, the common methods used to evaluate dis-\nease  severity  consisted  of  scoring  visual  symptoms  displayed  by\nthe  plant.  For  pathogens  able  to  kill  plants  completely,  survival\nrates  are  scored  to  evaluate  disease  resistance. Alternatively,  for\npathogens causing necrosis without killing the host, the degree of\nnecrosis over time is used as a measure to monitor resistance (9).\nHowever, these techniques have several limitations. First, they can\nbe used only when the pathogen–host interaction results in visible\ndisease symptoms, which is a limiting factor in the earliest stages\nof  infection.  Second,  there  is  not  always  a  straightforward  rela-\ntionship between disease symptoms and pathogen development in\nplants (24,53). Indeed, a tolerant host can show no disease symp-\ntoms,  without  reduction  in  pathogen  growth  within  the  plant\n(12,42).  Therefore,  a  method  for  direct  assessment  of  pathogen\ndevelopment in infected plants was necessary.\nSeveral techniques have been developed with the aim of quanti-\nfying pathogen biomass. Some of these are based on the measure-\nment of compounds such as ergosterol or chitin (18,21,32,40,43)\nwhich are present in the pathogen but not in the host. The prob-\nlem with these methods is the lack of specificity and the fact that\nthey  can  be  used  only  to  assess  colonization  by  pathogens  that\npossess  these  constituents  (3).  Another  group  of  techniques  in-\ncludes  the  use  of  immunological  methods  for  pathogen  biomass\ndetermination  (13,22,29,38).  However,  among  the  drawbacks  of\nthese  methods  are  the  difficulty  in  obtaining  antibodies  with  the\nrequired  specificity  for  particular  fungi  (56),  false-positive  reac-\ntions (51,52), and interference of plant factors with the measured\nparameter (35,53).\nIn  recent  years,  the  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  method\nhas been used successfully to detect and identify fungal pathogens\n(48). Among the PCR-based methods, real-time PCR has proven\nto  be  a  simple  yet  reliable  technique  to  quantify  viral,  bacterial,\nfungal,  and  oomycete  plant  pathogens,  and  increasingly  is  being\nused  in  plant  pathology  (5,33,37,47,55).  In  this  technique,  the\nDNA of a specific target organism can be quantified by measure-\nment of the intensity  of fluorescence with time during the  expo-\nnential  phase  of  DNA  amplification.  Quantification  of  DNA  in\nunknown  samples  will  be  possible  by  direct  comparison  with\nstandards amplified in parallel reactions (36). The main advantage\nof this technique compared with the conventional one, end-point\nquantitative PCR, is that the amplification products can be moni-\ntored as they are accumulated  in the log-linear phase of amplifi-\ncation.  Therefore,  it  is  more  accurate,  less  time-consuming,  and\nbetter  suited,  especially  when  the  objective  is  to  discriminate\nbetween slightly different levels of infection (58).\nPhytophthora root rot, caused by Phytophthora capsici Leonian,\nis  the  most  destructive  disease  of  pepper  crops  in  Spain  (39,44).\nIn  susceptible  plants,  the  pathogen  penetrates  through  the  collar,\ncausing necrosis in that area. At the same time, the plant becomes\nwithered  while  the  pathogen  advances  systemically  toward  both\nthe  stem  and  the  root,  causing  an  obstruction  in  the  vascular\nsystem. The infected tissues become dry, sunken, and parchment-\nlike, and turn dark in color. Finally, the plant dies at the last stage\nof  infection. Although  the  most  effective  method  to  combat  the\npathogen  is  based  on  the  use  of  fungicides,  some  cultivars  with\ndifferent  levels  of  resistance  to  P.  capsici  have  been  reported.\nIndeed, several different screening methods have been developed\nto distinguish Phytophthora-resistant individuals from susceptible\nones (1,7,8,19). Different sources of resistance to P. capsici have\nbeen reported in Capsicum annuum L.; among the genotypes that\nexhibit  resistance  to  Phytophthora  root  rot  are  United  States\nDepartment  of  Agriculture  (USDA)  PI201234  and  USDA\nPI201232, as well as Serrano Criollo de Morelos 331 (SCM331)\nand SCM334, the latter being more resistant to P. capsici than the\nformer (4,20,41).\nIn a previous study (50), we developed a PCR procedure for the\nearly detection of P. capsici in pepper plants. Specific primers for\nP. capsici, based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of\nribosomal DNA, were designed and tested for their sensitivity and\nspecificity  as  well  as  for  their  ability  to  detect  the  pathogen  in\nartificially and naturally infected pepper plants (50). The develop-\nment of a real-time approach enabled the quantification of patho-\ngen  biomass  in  plants  over  the  course  of  infection. This  method\nwill  facilitate  the  characterization  of  host–pathogen  interactions.\nThe aims of the present work were to (i) develop a real-time PCR\nassay  to  quantify  P.  capsici  biomass  in  pepper  plants  and  (ii)\nmonitor pathogen growth in pepper plants in relation to different\nlevels of pathogen virulence and host susceptibility.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPathogen material. In recent works carried out in our labora-\ntory  (C.  Silvar,  F.  Merino,  and  J.  Díaz,  unpublished  data),  a\npopulation  of  Spanish  P.  capsici  isolates  was  characterized  ac-\ncording  to  their  virulence.  Two  different  isolates,  one  highly\nvirulent  (UDC196Pc)  and  one  less  virulent  (UDC248Pc),  were\nselected  for  this  work.  The  isolates  were  maintained  on  potato\ndextrose  agar  (PDA)  for  further  use.  To  obtain  mycelium,  the\nisolates were grown in still culture in pea broth (11). After 1 week\nof  incubation  at  24°C,  mycelium  was  collected  and  lyophilized\nfor extended storage.\nPlant material. Three different cultivars of pepper plants were\nused:  susceptible  cv. Yolo  Wonder,  and  SCM331  and  PI201234,\neach  with  different  levels  of  resistance  to  P.  capsici,  SCM331\nbeing the most resistant (4). Moreover, a susceptible local cultivar\n(Padrón)  was  included  because  of  its  economic  value  in  north-\nwestern Spain. Plants were transferred into pots and grown sepa-\nrately in a chamber at 25°C and a photoperiod of 16 h of light and\n8 h of darkness until they were 3 weeks old.\nPathogen  inoculation,  quantification  bioassay,  and  disease\nassessment.  A  suspension  of  zoospores  from  UDC196Pc  and\nUDC248Pc were obtained according to Larkin et al. (30). Pepper\nplants were inoculated with a concentration of 10  zoospores ml\nby  adding  5  ml  of  the  inoculum  into  the  soil.  For  the  quantifi-\ncation of pathogen DNA, samples of leaves, stems, and roots were\ncollected  at  8,  24,  48,  and  72  h  postinoculation  in  the  different\ncultivars. Three independent experiments were carried out.\nIn parallel, assays were carried out with the aim of studying the\ndisease  progression  in  different  cultivars  during  a  time  period.\nWith this purpose, 10 plants of each cultivar were inoculated with\nthe  two  different  isolates  (UDC196Pc  and  UDC248Pc).  Disease\nseverity was rated for 20 days after inoculation on a scale of 0 to\n5, where 0 = no visible symptoms; 1 = ≤50% of stem with water-\nsoaked lesions, ≤50% of leaves wilted, or both; 2 = >50% of stem\nwith  water-soaked  lesions  or  >50%  of  leaves  wilted;  3  =  both\n≤50%  of  stem  with  water-soaked  lesions  and  >50%  of  leaves\nwilted or both >50% of stem with water-soaked lesions and ≤50%\nof leaves wilted; 4 = >50% of stem with water-soaked lesions and\n>50% of leaves wilted; and 5 = dead plant. Percentage of diseased\nplants (incidence) also was recorded during the time course of in-\nfection. In this case, two independent experiments were performed.\nIsolation of P. capsici from artificially infected plants. Colo-\nnization of pepper plants by P. capsici was determined in each of\nthe  pepper  cultivars  studied  by  isolating  the  pathogen  on  PDA.\nDuring  the  host–plant  infection  assay,  samples  of  plants  were\ncollected at 8, 24, 48, and 72 h postinoculation. Entire plants were\nsurface  disinfected  with  NaClO  (10%)  for  5  min,  washed  with\ndistilled water,  dried,  and plated onto PDA  medium. Plates were\nincubated at 24°C in the dark for 7 days.\nDNA extraction. For DNA extraction, both pathogen and plant\nmaterial (0.2 g fresh weight [FW]) were ground with liquid nitro-\ngen  to  a  fine  powder  using  a  mortar  and  pestle. All  the  powder\nwas transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing extraction buffer\n(0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1.4 M NaCl, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 1%\npolyvinyl  pyrrolidone,  and  2%  cetyltrimethylammonium  bro-\nmide).  Subsequently,  extraction  with  phenol/chloroform/isoamyl\nalcohol (25:24:1, vol/vol) was carried out. DNA was precipitated\nwith  isopropanol,  washed  with  cold  ethanol  (70%),  and  resus-\npended in sterile distilled water.\nReal-time PCR assay. Real-time PCR assays for quantification\nof both isolates in different cultivars were conducted using primer\npair CAPFW/CAPRV1 (50), which defines an amplicon of 452 bp\nspecific  for  P.  capsici.  Real-time  PCR  was  performed  in  an\niCycler  (BioRad,  Hercules,  CA)  apparatus  and  results  were  ana-\nlyzed with the manufacturer’s software (Optical System Software,\nv. 3.0; BioRad). Each reaction mixture (20 µl) contained 2.5 µl of\nundiluted DNA extract, 1× iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad),\nand 0.3 µM of each primer. In negative controls, the DNA extracts\nwere  obtained  from  noninoculated  plants  of  the  same  age  and\nsame  culture  conditions  as  inoculated  ones.  Additional  negative\ncontrol  reactions  contained  the  same  mixtures  with  2.5  µl  of\nsterile  water  replacing  the  DNA. The  thermal  cycling  conditions\nconsisted of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min followed by\n40  cycles  at  95°C  for  30  s,  56°C  for  30  s,  72°C  for  1  min,  and\n84°C for 15 s. A final extension step at 72°C for 5 min was added.\nFluorescence of the target amplicon (melting temperature (Tm) =\n86.5°C) was detected at 84°C. After the final amplification cycle,\na  melting  curve  temperature  profile  was  obtained  by  heating  to\n95°C, cooling to 65°C, and slowly heating to 95°C at 0.5°C every\n10 s with continuous measurement of fluorescence at 520 nm. A\nstandard  curve  was  constructed  by  plotting  the  logarithm  of\n10-fold  serial  dilutions  from  100  to  10    ng  of  P.  capsici  DNA\nagainst the cycle threshold (Ct) values. The Ct value is the cycle\nnumber at which the fluorescence emission of the PCR amplicon\ncould be distinguished from the background.\nIn  another  assay,  a  10-fold  serial  dilution  of  genomic  DNA\nstarting from 100 ng was added to samples containing 100 ng of\npepper genomic DNA. This was done in order to test whether the\npresence  of  samples  of  plant  DNA  would  interfere  with  the  ac-\ncurate  quantification.  When  constructing  a  regression  line  with\nthese data, a linear relationship was observed, as happened in the\nstandard  curve  (data  not  shown).  From  these  results,  it  was\nconcluded  that  addition  of  host  DNA  has  no  effect  on  pathogen\nDNA quantification.\nThe amount of pathogen DNA in unknown samples was calcu-\nlated  by  monitoring  the  Ct  value  at  which  the  fluorescence\nemission  could  be  differentiated  from  the  background  and  com-\nparing this Ct value with the point values of the linear regression\nline of the standard curve. Furthermore, to confirm that only one\nPCR product was amplified in the inoculated plants and no ampli-\nfication  product  was  obtained  in  the  negative  controls,  all  reac-\ntions  were  analyzed  by  electrophoresis  in  a  1%  (wt/vol)  agarose\ngel in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (31) and stained with ethidium\nbromide (5 µg ml  ) for visualization.\nStatistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using\nStatgraphics Plus for Windows, 5.1 Professional Version (StatPoint,\nInc., Herndon, VA). Data of pathogen DNA quantification among\ncultivars  were  analyzed  using  the  Kruskal-Wallis  test  (P  ≤  0.05)\nfollowed by the multiple comparison procedure of Conover (10).\nRESULTS\nDisease assessment in different pepper cultivars. The capac-\nity of the two P. capsici isolates to infect pepper plants was tested\nin  a  group  of  four  pepper  genotypes,  differing  in  their  degree  of\nsusceptibility  to  the  pathogen.  Data  on  disease  severity  were\nplotted  over  time  to  obtain  disease  progress  curves  (Fig.  1).  In\ngeneral,  differences  could  be  observed  among  cultivars,  isolates,\nand  cultivar–isolate  interactions.  Susceptible  cv.  Yolo  Wonder\nshowed high disease severity with both P. capsici isolates. Seed-\nlings were attacked primarily in the collar region and the infection\nrapidly  expanded  up  the  hypocotyl,  reaching  the  cotyledons\nwithin a few days. Host plants revealed the first visible symptoms\non the fourth day after inoculation, although the disease progress\nover time was higher in plants inoculated with UDC196Pc than in\nthose infected with UDC248Pc. In the first case, a maximal infec-\ntion (severity index = 4.8) was reached at 17 days after infection\n(Fig. 1A) and the percentage  of infected plants at the end of the\nbioassay  was  95%  (data  not  shown).  In  the  Yolo  Wonder–\nUDC248Pc interaction, however, disease progression was slower\nand the severity rating achieved at the end of the ongoing period\nwas only 1.5 (Fig. 1B), with  only 30%  diseased  plants (data not\nshown). After  inoculation  with  UDC196Pc,  the  infection  pattern\ndisplayed by local cv. Padrón was similar to that in Yolo Wonder,\nbut showed the highest degree of susceptibility (severity rate = 5\nand  percentage  of  infected  plants  =  100%)  (Fig.  1A).  However,\nafter  inoculation  with  UDC248Pc,  the  severity  achieved  by Yolo\nWonder was higher than in Padrón (Fig. 1B).\nIn  contrast,  resistant  genotypes  showed  the  lowest  disease\nseverity.  No  disease  symptoms  were  observed  when  the  plants\nwere infected with UDC248Pc, and slower progress curves were\nobtained in the PI201234– or SCM331–UDC196Pc system com-\npared  with  those  in  susceptible  cultivars.  In  the  last  case,  more\nsymptoms developed in PI201234 than in SCM331, with 40 and\n20%  disease  percentage  (data  not  shown)  and  2  and  1  severity\nindex, respectively, at the  end  of the trials.  Noninoculated plants\ndid not show any symptoms (data not shown).\nP. capsici was isolated successfully from leaves, stems, and roots\nin  all  pepper  genotypes  inoculated  with  both  isolates  at  24,  48,\nand  72  h  after  inoculation.  However,  no  pathogen  isolation  was\npossible at 8 h in any pepper–P. capsici system (data not shown).\nReal-time PCR adjustment and DNA standard curves. Pre-\nliminary runs of real-time PCR without the step at 84°C for 15 s\nwere  carried  out  with  the  aim  of  detecting  some  possible  non-\nspecific  amplification  products  or  primer-dimers.  Melting  curve\nprofiles  from  those  runs  revealed  the  presence  of  such  products,\nwith a Tm ≤ 82°C. Therefore, to avoid any possible disturbance in\nthe  quantification  of  the  target  amplicon  (Tm  =  86.5°C),  an  ad-\nditional  step  (84°C  for  15  s)  was  included  in  the  real-time  PCR\namplification  program  and  the  reading  of  the  fluorescence  emis-\nsion was set at this point. Additionally, to confirm the presence of\nthe  single  expected  amplicon  of  452  bp,  final  products  of  real-\ntime  PCR  from  both  standard  curve  and  unknown  samples  were\nvisualized in agarose gels (data not shown).\nA  standard  curve  was  constructed  by  plotting  known  concen-\ntrations  of  P.  capsici  DNA  against  the  Ct  values  obtained  from\nreal-time PCR (Fig. 2). In order to validate the reproducibility of\nthe  real-time  PCR  method,  PCR  amplifications  were  conducted\nwith duplicate samples of pathogen DNA obtained from four dif-\nferent  preparations.  Highly  reproducible  Ct  values  with  very\nsmall standard deviations were observed, the linear regression co-\nefficient of the  standard curve  being r  = 0.968. Within this  stan-\ndard  curve,  each  10-fold  difference  in  initial  DNA  amounts  was\nrepresented by approximately four-cycle differences in Ct. Under\nthe  PCR  conditions  tested,  the  minimum  starting  quantity  of\npathogen  DNA  that  could  be  accurately  quantified  in  our  assays\nwas 10   ng, which corresponded to a Ct value of 36.97 ± 1.06. A\nCt  of  37  (6  ×  10    ng  of  DNA  according  to  the  standard  curve)\nwas  considered  to  be  the  threshold  value  suitable  for  quanti-\nfication, because PCR efficiency at a higher number of cycles was\nfar from the value 1 (100% efficiency).\nQuantification of P. capsici DNA in pepper plants. Pathogen\nDNA  was  quantified  in  plants  using  real-time  PCR  with  SYBR\nGreen  before  first  symptoms  of  the  disease  were  observed  in\nplants  (Figs.  3,  4,  and  5).  Indeed,  symptoms  did  not  appear  in\ninfected  plants  until  4  days  after  inoculation;  however,  with  the\nreal-time PCR assay, pathogen DNA could be quantified as early\nas  8  h  postinoculation  in  all  the  organs  of  the  plant.  From  that\ntime  point,  the  pathogen  DNA  in  pepper  organs  increased  pro-\ngressively  until  the  end  of  the  bioassay.  Real-time  PCR  quanti-\nfication showed important differences among the different organs.\nIn general, stems were more heavily colonized than roots, and the\nlatter  more  than  leaves.  In  all  cases,  the  maximal  amount  of\npathogen  DNA  occurred  at  72  h  after  inoculation. Although  the\npathogen  was  able  to  colonize  all  the  susceptible  and  resistant\npepper  cultivars  evaluated,  the  extent  of  colonization  varied\nhighly among cultivars with different levels of resistance. In most\nof the cases, higher amounts of pathogen DNA were present at 72\nh  after  inoculation  in  susceptible  cultivars  (Padrón  and  Yolo\nWonder) than in the more resistant ones (PI201234 and SCM331).\nIn  the  susceptible  cultivars,  pathogen  DNA  was  detected  earlier\nand  increased  sharply  over  time  whereas,  in  the  resistant  plants,\nthe variations in pathogen development were slighter. Significant\n(P ≤ 0.05) differences were found among resistant and susceptible\ncultivars  as  early  as  24  h  postinoculation  in  the  stem  for  the\nUDC196Pc  isolate  (Fig.  4A)  although,  at  48  h,  there  was  no\nsignificant  differences.  The  differences  were  significant  at  72  h\npostinoculation in all the organs and isolates, except for the com-\nbination of the roots and the isolate UDC196Pc (Fig. 5A). Com-\nparing  the  cultivars  separately,  susceptible  cvs.  Padrón  and Yolo\nWonder  displayed  a  similar  pattern  of  pathogen  invasion,  but\nsignificant differences between them were found in the roots at 48\nand 72 h postinoculation (Fig. 5A and B). For the resistant culti-\nvars,  significant  differences  were  found  in  SCM331  compared\nwith the partially resistant cv. PI201234 only in the case of roots\nat 48 h postinoculation (Fig. 5A and B). In any case, the accumu-\nlation  of  pathogen  DNA  in  these  resistant  genotypes  was  slower\nthan  that  in  susceptible  cultivars  and  the  amount  of  pathogen\nDNA generally remained lower during the study.\nWith regard to the two P. capsici isolates, a different pattern of\ninfection  was  observed.  Up  to  5.9  ng  g    FW  of  pathogen  DNA\nwas  observed  as  soon  as  8  h  postinoculation  in  the  Padrón–  or\nYolo  Wonder–UDC196Pc  interactions  (Fig.  4A)  whereas,  in\nsusceptible cultivar–UDC248Pc interactions, the maximal amount\nof DNA detectable was 0.2 ng g   FW (Fig. 4B). In the same way,\nthe  average  pathogen  DNA  in  the  resistant  cultivar–UDC196Pc\nsystem  was  1.4  ng  g    FW,  whereas  it  could  not  be  detected  in\nPI201234 or in SCM331 until 24 h after infection, when the plants\nwere  inoculated  with  the  least  virulent  pathogen  (UDC248Pc).\nDuring the remaining period, the amount of UDC196Pc (the iso-\nlate previously characterized as more virulent) DNA was up to 10\ntimes higher than UDC248Pc (less virulent) in all cultivars evalu-\nated. These results correspond with those obtained in the severity\nassessment  assay,  where  clear  differences  between  isolates  also\nwere observed.\nDISCUSSION\nOne of the objectives of this study was the development of an\naccurate  quantification  method  of  pathogen  colonization  in  host\ntissue using real-time PCR technology and the use of this method\nfor  a  better  understanding  of  the  interaction  between  different\npepper genotypes and P. capsici isolates. With this purpose, four\npepper cultivars were artificially infected with two P. capsici iso-\nlates, differing in their degree of virulence toward pepper plants.\nPathogen  DNA  was  monitored  and  quantified  in  a  time  course\nafter inoculation using a quantitative SYBR Green PCR assay. In\nrecent years, real-time PCR assays have been widely used for the\ndetection  and  quantification  of  fungal  plant  pathogens  (2,15,48).\nSimilar  studies  have  been  carried  out  in  Phytophthora  spp.  (5,6,\n23,26,55).  However,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  attempts\nhad been made to apply the real-time PCR technology for quanti-\nfication of P. capsici in pepper plants.\nIn  our  study,  the  results  showed  that  real-time  PCR  can  be\nsuccessfully implemented for the quantification of pepper coloni-\nzation  by  P.  capsici. The  technique  was  highly  reproducible,  the\ncorrelation  coefficient  of  the  standard  curve  constructed  with\ndifferent  replications  being  0.968. At  the  same  time,  the  method\nwas  quite  sensitive,  being  able  to  readily  detect,  using  the  un-\nspecific SYBR Green dye and specific primers to P. capsici, up to\n10   ng of pathogen DNA. Similar quantification limits have been\nfound  in  other  pathogen–plant  interactions  (15–17)  as  well  as  in\nother  Phytophthora  spp.,  although  using  different  real-time\nchemistries  (26).  The  Ct  values  depend  on  both  the  amount  of\nstarting  DNA  and  the  genomic  organization  of  the  target  se-\nquences  recognized  by  the  sequence-specific  primer  pair;  there-\nfore,  the  efficiency  of  the  technique  will  improve  if  the  target\nDNA is present in many copies in the genome, as is the case with\nrDNA.  This  sensitivity  was  similar  to  that  achieved  in  previous\nworks using conventional PCR but less than that obtained with a\nnested PCR assay (50). These results agree with those published\nrecently  by  Bonants  et  al.  (6)  working  on  P.  fragariae.  They\nobtained  equivalent  detection  limits  by  using  either  conventional\nPCR or a TaqMan assay but higher sensitivity with a nested PCR.\nIn any case, with this sensitivity, pathogen abundance can be re-\nliably  quantified  from  the  very  beginning  of  the  infection  time\ncourse and even in tissues exhibiting a low degree of infection.\nIn  a  parallel  assay,  the  influence  of  plant  samples  on  quanti-\nfication was tested (data not shown). Serial dilutions (10-fold) of\npathogen DNA were mixed with an equal amount of plant DNA.\nThis  mixture  possibly  could  reflect  an  infection  from  a  range  of\n1:1 (a very heavy infection) to a range of 1:10  (an early stage of\ninfection). The presence of a host sample of DNA did not produce\nany interference in the quantification. Furthermore, with this tech-\nnique, the sensitivity of the method was not affected by the pres-\nence  of  a  plant  DNA  sample,  as  occurs  with  conventional  and\nnested PCR (50).\nIn a real-time PCR assay, the accumulation of the amplicon can\nbe  detected  using  either  specific  detection  methods  such  as\nTaqMan  probes  (25,54,57)  or  nonspecific  methods  like  SYBR\nGreen (36). The advantage of SYBR Green is that, in contrast to\nfluorogenic probes, it does not require the design of specific com-\nplementary fragments to the target DNA and, therefore, the reac-\ntion cost is limited compared with real-time PCRs that depend on\nhybridization of labeled  sequence-specific probes. The  main dis-\nadvantage  of  this  method  is  that  it  binds  double-stranded  DNA\nand, therefore, it also can associate with primer-dimers and non-\nspecific products, which can seriously disturb the interpretation of\nthe results. However, this major drawback can be overcome with\nthe  use  of  melting  curve  temperature  analysis  at  the  end  of  the\nPCR assay (46). At the end of the cycling reactions, the products\nare melted by slowly increasing the temperature while continually\nmonitoring  the  fluorescence. After  melting  curve  analysis  in  our\nassay, the use of unspecific SYBR Green dye for quantifying the\ntarget amplicon (≈452 bp, Tm = 86.5°C) required a 84°C fluores-\ncence emission reading step in the amplification program to elimi-\nnate  any  interference  caused  by  the  accumulation  of  unspecific\nPCR products. At that temperature, the nonspecific products will\nbe  denatured  and  only  the  fluorogenic  emission  from  the  target\namplicon would result.\nOne of the results in this work is that the real-time PCR method\ndeveloped  here  is  able  to  quantify  pathogen  invasion  in  the\nabsence of visible host plant symptoms. Although the first visible\nsymptoms appeared in plants by day four after infection, quanti-\nfication  was  possible  at  earlier  times  (as  soon  as  8  h  postinocu-\nlation)  in  totally  asymptomatic  plants. Thereafter,  the  amount  of\npathogen  DNA  either  increased  sharply  or  varied  more  slightly\nduring  the  study  period,  but  in  no  case  were  the  symptoms  ob-\nserved in inoculated plants. It must be pointed out that P. capsici\nis detected in leaves at 8 h postinoculation. It is surprising that the\npathogen can invade and colonize the host so fast. This fact prob-\nably is due to the pathogen’s ability to move through the vascular\nsystem and the small size of the plants at the time of the experi-\nments. It was also an unexpected result that the pathogen was not\nisolated at 8 h after inoculation, taking into account that pathogen\nDNA  was detected at that time.  Maybe nonviable pathogen cells\nwere present at that time. Another possibility is that the pathogen\ncolonized  only  the  outer  layers  of  cells  at  that  time,  after  which\nsurface sterilization could have killed the pathogen.\nThe amount of pathogen DNA quantified 72 h after inoculation\nin each pepper genotype correlated with the level of susceptibility\nor  resistance  to  disease  caused  by  P.  capsici  (as  indicated  by\nseverity  of  symptoms).  Maximal  absolute  amounts  of  pathogen\nDNA  were  quantified  in  susceptible  genotypes Yolo Wonder  and\nPadrón  (the  most  severely  diseased  genotypes),  where  measure-\nments in stems ranged from 3.3 × 10  ng g   FW in UDC196Pc–\nYolo  Wonder  to  1.6  ×  10   ng  g    FW  in  UDC196Pc–Padron.\nActual amounts of P. capsici DNA varied considerably for a given\npepper genotype–P. capsici isolate interaction and, in some cases,\nbetween  P.  capsici  isolates  for  a  given  pepper  genotype.  In  the\nsame way, smaller amounts of pathogen DNA were quantified in\nPI201234 and  SCM331 plants, in that order. These two cultivars\nalso  produced  fewer  diseased  plants  or  even  none  at  all.  There-\nfore,  reduced  disease  severity  in  those  cultivars  considered\nresistant corresponded to the results of the quantitative analysis of\npathogen  DNA.  In  recent  years,  several  different  studies  have\ndemonstrated  the  utility  of  real-time  PCR  to  discriminate  be-\ntween  plant  genotypes  displaying  different  levels  of  resistance\n(9,17,34,45,59). Vandemark and Barker (55), studying the P. medi-\ncaginis–alfalfa  interaction,  were  able  to  discriminate  among\nthree alfalfa populations with  different levels  of resistance. They\nalso  detected  less  pathogen  DNA  in  highly  resistant  alfalfa\npopulations  than  in  more  susceptible  ones.  Moreover,  the  re-\nsults  of  our  work  corroborate  others  published  previously  which\nestablished  clear  differences  in  resistance  among  SCM331  and\nPI201234  (resistant  cultivars)  and  Yolo  Wonder  (susceptible\ngenotype)  (4,19,20).  The  difference  with  the  present  work\nis  that  previous  classifications  of  peppers  susceptible  or  re-\nsistant  to  Phytophthora  root  rot  were  based  on  the  evaluation  of\nexternal  symptoms  and  measurement  of  incidence  and  severity\nof  plant  symptoms,  which  is  time  consuming  and  sometimes  in-\nconclusive.\nIn terms of pathogen ability to infect the plant, it seemed clear\nthat  the  more  virulent  isolate  had  a  better  capacity  not  only  to\ninfect the plant sooner but also to spread quicker during the time\ncourse  of  infection.

Maximal  absolute  amounts  of  pathogen\nDNA  were  quantified  in  susceptible  genotypes Yolo Wonder  and\nPadrón  (the  most  severely  diseased  genotypes),  where  measure-\nments in stems ranged from 3.3 × 10  ng g   FW in UDC196Pc–\nYolo  Wonder  to  1.6  ×  10   ng  g    FW  in  UDC196Pc–Padron.\nActual amounts of P. capsici DNA varied considerably for a given\npepper genotype–P. capsici isolate interaction and, in some cases,\nbetween  P.  capsici  isolates  for  a  given  pepper  genotype.  In  the\nsame way, smaller amounts of pathogen DNA were quantified in\nPI201234 and  SCM331 plants, in that order. These two cultivars\nalso  produced  fewer  diseased  plants  or  even  none  at  all.  There-\nfore,  reduced  disease  severity  in  those  cultivars  considered\nresistant corresponded to the results of the quantitative analysis of\npathogen  DNA.  In  recent  years,  several  different  studies  have\ndemonstrated  the  utility  of  real-time  PCR  to  discriminate  be-\ntween  plant  genotypes  displaying  different  levels  of  resistance\n(9,17,34,45,59). Vandemark and Barker (55), studying the P. medi-\ncaginis–alfalfa  interaction,  were  able  to  discriminate  among\nthree alfalfa populations with  different levels  of resistance. They\nalso  detected  less  pathogen  DNA  in  highly  resistant  alfalfa\npopulations  than  in  more  susceptible  ones.  Moreover,  the  re-\nsults  of  our  work  corroborate  others  published  previously  which\nestablished  clear  differences  in  resistance  among  SCM331  and\nPI201234  (resistant  cultivars)  and  Yolo  Wonder  (susceptible\ngenotype)  (4,19,20).  The  difference  with  the  present  work\nis  that  previous  classifications  of  peppers  susceptible  or  re-\nsistant  to  Phytophthora  root  rot  were  based  on  the  evaluation  of\nexternal  symptoms  and  measurement  of  incidence  and  severity\nof  plant  symptoms,  which  is  time  consuming  and  sometimes  in-\nconclusive.\nIn terms of pathogen ability to infect the plant, it seemed clear\nthat  the  more  virulent  isolate  had  a  better  capacity  not  only  to\ninfect the plant sooner but also to spread quicker during the time\ncourse  of  infection.

The a/LCI technique obtains\nnuclear structural information by examining the angular dis-\ntribution of backscattered light. With a/LCI, depth resolution\nis achieved by the use of a short-coherence-length light source\nin an interferometry scheme. This method of coherence gating\nis also employed to obtain depth resolution in optical coher-\nence tomography OCT, a technique used to construct to-\nmographic images of living tissues.    However, a/LCI has the\nadded feature of resolving the angular distribution of scattered\nlight, enabling structural measurements that exceed the reso-\nlution obtained with OCT. In a/LCI measurements, just as in\nOCT, the depth resolution serves as a powerful means of re-\njecting multiply scattered light, enabling selective measure-\nments of light that has interacted only with a tissue region of\ninterest. This capability has been exploited to examine exclu-\nsively the morphology of basal cell nuclei, rejecting the light\nscattered by the suprabasal layers.\nIn the presented studies, quantitative measurements of\nnuclear morphology were used as biomarkers for detecting\nand characterizing the degree of neoplastic change in the rat\nesophagus. Two a/LCI systems are used to measure in situ,\nthe mean diameter of cell nuclei and to parameterize the cy-\ntonuclear texture of cells in living tissue of rat esophageal\nepithelium without the need for ﬁxation, sectioning, and stain-\ning. The mean diameter results, a measure of the degree of\nneoplastic transformation, are used to classify the tissue sites\nin a prospective fashion based on grading criteria established\nin a previous a/LCI study.  The performance of a/LCI to pro-\nspectively grade the tissue sites is compared with the ob-\nserved modulation of the incidence of dysplasia used to assess\nthe efﬁcacy of chemopreventive agents.\nNMBA, with a purity of      was purchased from Ash\nStevens, Inc.

         "the apoptotic sample was\nfound to be 1.86.\nThe tissue classiﬁcations presented in this section were\ndetermined by a/LCI measurements executed with the second\ngeneration system and subsequently conﬁrmed by histopatho-\nlogical evaluation of the probed tissue sites. However, as\nshown in Table 1, fewer animals were used for the curcumin\nstudy than for the DFMO study. This decrease was enabled by\nthe faster data acquisition time of the second generation a/LCI\nsystem, permitting up to six data points to be acquired from\none tissue sample. As with the DFMO study, when the histo-\nlogical slides of the samples presented signiﬁcant artifacts,\nwhich prevented coregistration with the a/LCI probe, the data\nwere omitted from the study. The consequences of discarding\nthese data are described in the discussion section.\nFor samples where coregistration was achieved, the a/LCI\nand histopathological grading methods were found to com-\npletely agree for the         samples. For the\nsamples, a/LCI identiﬁed two LGD tissue sites as normal,\nresulting in two false negatives. To clarify this difference in\ngrading, note that these two false negatives were found to\nhave mean nuclear diameters of        , only        below\ndecision line. Including these two false negatives, the use of\nthe second-generation a/LCI system to prospectively grade\nthe neoplastic progression of the tissue sites resulted in 82%\nsensitivity        dysplastic tissue sites and 100% speciﬁcity\n       normal tissue sites.\nTo assess the efﬁcacy of curcumin as a chemopreventive\nagent, we compare the incidence of dysplasia\nthe group 6 NMBA only and group 7\nfor\nsamples. For the         data, there is a slight\ndifference between group 6, showing a high 60% incidence\nof dysplasia, and group 7, which shows a signiﬁcantly lower\nincidence 29% of dysplasia and some apoptotic sites 14%.\nThe difference becomes more pronounced at         , with a\nhigh incidence 100% of dysplasia in group 6 and no inci-\ndence 0% of dysplasia in group 7, although no apoptotic\nsites were detected for this group.\nThe chemopreventive efﬁcacy of curcumin can also be as-\nsessed by examining the tumor incidence, multiplicity and\nsize data for the samples used in the study Table 3. The data\nshow decreases in tumor incidence, multiplicity and size be-\ntween group 2 NMBA only and group 3\nat          after the ﬁrst NMBA injection. We\nnote that only the decrease in tumor multiplicity has a statis-\ntical signiﬁcance           . At         , none of the tumor\ndata show decreases for group 3 compared to those for group\n2 but the changes are not statistically signiﬁcant           .\nThus, with a/LCI analysis, we see a signiﬁcant change in\nincidence of dysplasia at          with a sharper decrease in\nincidence seen for curcumin treated samples at         . In\ncomparison, the tumor metrology data show signiﬁcant de-\ncrease in tumor multiplicity at          but no statistically\nsigniﬁcant decreases in any of the tumor metrology data at\n.\nIn the two studies described here, a/LCI was used to prospec-\ntively grade the neoplastic progression of rat esophagus epi-\nthelium samples through nuclear morphology measurements\ncarried out in freshly excised, intact tissue samples without\nthe need for exogenous staining agents, ﬁxation or tissue sec-\ntioning. The mean diameter of cell nuclei in the basal epithe-\nlial layer was used as the grading criteria, as it was shown to\nbe a powerful indicator of neoplastic progression in a previ-\nous study.  The utility of a/LCI for monitoring neoplastic pro-\ngression is evident by the high rate of success in classifying\ntissues by their degree of neoplastic change Table 5. The\noriginal prototype a/LCI system exhibited a high sensitivity\nand speciﬁcity 100% and 93% respectively while the second\ngeneration system also showed a lower sensitivity 82% but a\nhigher speciﬁcity 100%. We note that the decrease in sensi-\ntivity of the second-generation system is due to two false\nnegatives seen in the sites examined at          for which\nthe measured diameter was only slightly below the decision\nline. Overall, on combining the results of the two studies, we\nﬁnd that a/LCI successfully identiﬁed 58 of 60 normal tissue\nsites 97% speciﬁcity and 20 of 22 dysplastic tissue sites\n91% sensitivity.\nAnalysis of the mean nuclear diameter data reveals an\nanomalous statistical trend in the standard deviation of the\naverage mean nuclear diameter measurements for tissue sites\nclassiﬁed as normal in the DFMO study. The average mean\nnuclear diameter is seen to change from               at\nto              at          to              at\n. On further examination, we can see that this trend\nis due to the emergence of a bimodal distribution of the mean\nnuclear diameters, as shown in Table 6. By separating the\nnormal samples into those treated with DFMO and those\nwithout treatment, we see that the mean nuclear diameter in-\nthat this change corresponds to a decrease in smaller struc-\ntures and an increase in larger struct",

         "The WBN/Kob-Ht rat (Ht-rat) is a spontaneous hair-\nless mutant of the Wistar strain that was established at\nIshikawa  Laboratory  Animal  Company,  Saitama,  Ja-\npan.    The  inheritance  mode  of  the  Ht  mutation  is\nautosomal  dominant,  and  the  Ht  locus  is  mapped  on\nchromosome 10 [1].  Since the inheritance mode of the\nHt gene is dominant and Ht homozygote rats have high\nmorbidity, the Ht-rat used for this study was of the Ht\nheterozygote type.  In a previous study, these rats spon-\ntaneously  developed  dermatitis  under  conventional\nconditions, with an incidence of approximately 4% at\n20 weeks of age [17].  However, the pathogenic mecha-\nnism  and  characteristics  of  the  dermatitis  were  not\nexamined from the viewpoint of studying allergy.\nIn human atopic dermatitis (AD), an increase in the\nnumber of infiltrating CD4- bearing T cells, mast cells,\nand eosinophils has been detected in acute skin lesions\nas compared with the normal skin [8, 9, 14].  The le-\nsions show a significant increase in the number of cells\nexpressing IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA, this suggest-\ning preferential accumulation of Th2-type cells.  In ad-\ndition, an increase in the expression of IL-4 and of IL-5\nhas been detected in CD4- and CD8-bearing T cells in\npatients  with  AD  [12,  18].    The  Th2-type  cytokines\nhave a critical role in the initiation of the allergic re-\nsponse in Staphylococcus aureus-associated dermatitis\n[10].  IL-4 plays an important role in the induction of\nIgE  production  [13]  and  as  an  inhibitor  of  bacterial\nclearance  [5,  16].    Kasamatsu  et  al.  demonstrated  an\nincreased amount of serum IL-4 in acute AD compared\nwith  the  normal  control  [7].    Furthermore,  up  to  10\ncolony-forming units of S. aureus can be isolated from\nskin  lesions  of  more  than  90%  of  AD  patients  [11],\nwhile only 5% of normal subjects carry S. aureus on\ntheir skin.\nIn this study, we analyzed dermatitis in the Ht-rat to\npursue its potential as an animal model for investigat-\ning the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) and to\ndevelop new therapeutic approaches or drugs to treat\nAD.  We discuss the characteristics of Ht-rats in com-\nparison  with  Nh-mice,  which  have  recently  been\nproposed as an animal model for human AD [3, 4, 19].\nHt-rats kept under a conventional condition until 25\nweeks of age displayed prominent symptoms of derma-\ntitis  including  edema  and  erythema  at  the  neck  (Fig.\n1A).  Dermatitis was observed in all Ht-rats that were\nmaintained under conventional conditions for 20 weeks,\nbut not in those maintained under SPF conditions (Fig.\n1B).  The rats could develop dermatitis only under con-\nventional conditions.  To evaluate the involvement of\nbacteria in the formation of the lesions, bacterial cul-\ntures were obtained from the facial skin surface of each\nHt-rat  kept  under  conventional  or  SPF  conditions.\nSamples  were  inoculated  onto  a  salt,  egg  yolk,  agar\nplate  (Nissui,  Tokyo,  Japan),  and  incubated  at  37°C.\nTen colonies per rat were randomly picked up, and the\nsub- species of Staphylococci were identified with an\nAN-ID Test-SP18 kit (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan).\nThe animals were humanely euthanized in accordance\nwith  the  guidelines  for  animal  experimentation  at\nShionogi  Research  Laboratories.    Skin  samples  were\nfixed in formalin or frozen in a freezer.  Four-microme-\nter thick paraffin sections of skin lesions of the Ht-rat\nwith or without dermatitis were stained with hematoxy-\nlin-eosin (HE) for histopathological observation, acidic\ntoluidine  blue  to  detect  mast  cells,  and  by  the  Luna\nmethod for eosinophils.  Frozen sections of the Ht-rat\nskin  with  or  without  dermatitis  were  immunostained\nusing  mouse  anti-rat  CD4  (OX-35,  PharMingen,  San\nDiego,  CA,  USA)  and  mouse  anti-rat  CD8a  (OX-8,\nPharMingen) antibodies.  Positive reactions on the sec-\ntions were visualized with peroxidase-diaminobenzidine,\nand the number of positive cells was counted.\nStaphylococcus  aureus  was  not  isolated  from  25-\nweek-old Ht-rats maintained under the SPF condition\n(Table 1), and approximately 70% of the isolated bac-\nteria  from  the  animals  housed  conventionally  were\ncommon  Staphylococcus  species  (S.  cohniiB  and  S.\nxylosus); the rest could not be identified.  These bacte-\nrial  strains  were  completely  replaced  by  S.  aureus  in\nconventionally  housed  Ht-rats  with  dermatitis  (Table\n1).  In view of these results, S. aureus appears to play\nan important role in the development of dermatitis in\nHt-rats.  Significant histopathological changes observed\nin the skin lesion of all Ht-rats included hyperkeratosis,\nacanthosis, slight intracellular edema of the epidermis,\nslight swelling of the epidermal cells, and the presence\nof inflammatory cells (Fig. 2A).  Higher levels of eosi-\nnophils  and  whole  and  degranulated  mast  cells  were\nobserved in the skin lesions of Ht-rats with dermatitis\nas compared with skin samples from the rats without\ndermatitis (Table 1, Figs. 2Ac and 2Ad).  In rats main-\ntained under the conventional condition, the number of\nCD4-bearing  T  cells  increased,  while  CD8-bearing  T\ncells  appeared  to  show  a  slight  increase  in  number.\nThe  ratio  of  CD4  to  CD8  cells  was  constantly  high.\nBoth CD4- and CD8-bearing T cells were rarely found\nin Ht-rats maintained under the SPF condition (Table\n1, Figs. 2Ae and 2Af).\nWe measured the serum IgE and IL-4 levels, since\nIgE and IL-4 play important roles in the pathogenesis\nof human AD [2, 12].  Serum samples from rats main-\ntained under the SPF or conventional conditions were\ncollected.  Total IgE and IL-4 levels in the serum were\nmeasured using sandwich ELISA kits (Bethyl, Mont-\ngomery,  TX,  USA;  and  Biosource,  Camarillo,  CA,\nUSA).  The level of serum IgE increased only in the\nHt-rats  that  were  maintained  under  the  conventional\ncondition, but not in those maintained under the SPF\nconditions.  Serum IL-4 was detected only in Ht-rats\nwith dermatitis (Fig. 2B).  Serum IFN-γ was not detect-\nable in any of the rats (data not shown).  Considering\nthe results, we propose that the Ht-rat can serve as a\nnew animal model for human AD.\nThe present rat model was compared with the DS-Nh\nmouse, which was recently introduced by Hikita et al.\n[4] and Yoshioka et al. [19].  The rat and mouse mod-\nels  may  be  similar  to  human  AD  with  respect  to  the\nfollowing features [4, 8, 11, 14, 15]: (1) S. aureus can\nbe isolated from skin lesions, (2) serum levels of IgE\nand IL-4 increase significantly, and (3) the number of\nwhole mast cells and CD4-bearing T cells significantly\nincrease.  Although both rodent models have much in\ncommon, there are some differences.  We found that all\nthe  S.  aureus  from  the  DS-Nh  mice  with  dermatitis\nsecrete  staphylococcal  enterotoxin  (SE)  C,  while  S.\naureus from the Ht-rats did not secrete superantigens\n(SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, SEE, and toxic shock syndrome\ntoxin)  (data  not  shown).    In  addition,  the  number  of\neosinophils significantly increased only in rats that were\nmaintained  under  the  conventional  condition,  but  no\nincrease was observed in the mice.\nAs described above, there are some genetic similari-\nties  between  Ht  and  Nh  mutations.    The  inheritance\nmode of both mutations is autosomal dominant [1, 3].\nThe Nh locus is mapped on mouse chromosome 11 and\nthe Ht locus on rat chromosome 10 [1, 3], and both the\ngenes  are  located  in  contiguity  with  the  linkage  site\n(unpublished data).  Furthermore, there are some phe-\nnotypical  similarities  between  both  mutated  rodents.\nHigher levels of mast cells were observed in the skin\nlesions  of  Ht-  or  Nh-mutated  rodents  compared  with\nskin samples of age-matched rodents without these mu-\ntatio",

Binding of Phospholipids by SF-1s and hLRH-1 Is Greater than for mLRH-1 or for the mSF-1 A270W Pocket Mutant\n(A) Nondenaturing mass spectrometry was carried out on all four LBD proteins used for crystallization (mSF-1, hSF-1 and mLRH-1, hLRH-1).\nSpectra are shown for mLRH-1 (left panel) and mSF-1 (right panel), with the apo [A], and the bound [B] species indicated. The molecular\nweight difference between the two peaks is also shown (arrow).\n(B) The concentrations of all bound LBD species, including the mSF-1 A270W pocket mutant, were determined as described and are listed\nfor equal amounts of LBD protein (w30 µM), with the exception of hSF-1, where more protein was used due to the poorer quality of protein\n(50 µM).\n(C) Product ions following collision-induced decomposition using denaturing electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS) on m/z\n745 (blue diamond) are shown for hSF-1 and reveal a phosphatidyl glycerol (chemical structure) ligand with two acyl chains of C16 and C18.\n(D) Electron density for mSF-1 is from a 2Fo−Fc map contoured at 1.2 sigma that shows the phospholipid ligand flanked by surrounding\nresidues (sticks).

Selective Binding to Phosphorylated Phosphatidyl Inositols by mSF-1 and Loss of Activity with mSF-1 Pocket Mutant\n(A) Binding patterns to immobilized phospholipids for mSF-1, the mSF-1 A270W pocket mutant, hLRH-1, and a control protein apo-hPPARγ\nare shown with the identity of each phospholipid indicated. Levels of all four proteins incubated were equivalent (data not shown). Quantifica-\ntion of binding by wild-type mutant mSF-1 LBD protein (A270W) showed selective binding to all PIP  and PIP  species by 1.85- to 3.1-fold.\nAbbreviations are as follows: lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphocholine (LPC), sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP), phosphatidic acid (PA),\nphosphatidyl choline (PC), serine (PS), ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl inositol (PI), phosphatidyl (3), (4), or (5) inositiol monophosphate (P3I),\n(P4I), or (P5I), phosphatidyl (3,4), (3,5), or (4,5) inositol bisphosphate (P3,4I), (P3,5I) (P4,5I), and finally phosphatidyl (3,4,5) inositol triphosphate\n(PIP ). Chemical structures are shown for PA and P3,4,5I.\n(B) Activities of pocket mutants made in comparable positions in helix H3 for mSF-1 (A270W mSF-1) are shown following transfections in\nHepG2 human cells with two luciferase reporters, the aromatase, and mouse SHP promoters. Relative luciferase activities are shown as fold\nactivation for each receptor at increasing concentrations (ng per 24 well plate), as indicated on the X axis.\n(C) The luciferase activity is shown for the corresponding helix H3 A368W pocket mutant for mLRH-1 on the aromatase promoter in HepG2\ncells.\nCell\nFigure 4. Selective Binding of Phosphatidyl Inositols to mSF-1\nIn the upper left corner, a flow diagram is shown for ligand analyses of mSF-1 LBD protein following incubation with different liposomes, as\ndescribed in Experimental Procedures. Mass spectra profiles (ESI-LC/MS) are shown for the basal state (No Liposomes, panel A), and after\nincubations with the neutral liposomes of phosphatidyl choline (PC, panel B), with phosphatidic acid liposomes (PC:PA [9:1], panel C), and\nwith phosphatidyl inositol liposomes PC:PI(3,4)P  [9:1] (PIP , panel D) or PC:PI(3,4,5)P  [9:1] (PIP , panel E). In (B), (D), and (E), the small\npeaks at mass 28730 Da are PC liganded receptor (PC), and in (C), the peak at mass 28646 is PA liganded receptor (PA). Direct mass\nspectrometry analysis (without gel filtration) on the PC:PA-receptor sample revealed a strong peak of free phosphatidic acid (data not shown),\nshowing that ample PA was present in the PC:PA liposomes.\nPhospholipids as NR5A Receptor Ligands\nFigure 5.

The Role of H2/H3 Structural Elements in Maintaining an\nActive Conformation of mLRH-1 and mSF-1\nIn the top panel, ribbon diagrams of partial structures of mLRH-1\nand mSF-1 are shown. Helices H2 (red) and H3 (pink) of mSF-1 are\nsuperposed with the helices H2 and H3 of mLRH-1 (light yellow),\nand the phosphatidyl glycerol ligand is shown (blue stick). The H2\nof mSF-1 is approximately half the length of helix H2 in mLRH-1\nH2. The bottom panel shows reporter activity in HepG2 cells with\nincreasing concentrations of wild-type and helix H5 mutants for\nboth mLRH-1 and mSF-1.

Amino Acids that Coordinate Ligand in SF-1 Are Ancestral\nThe maximum posterior probability phylogeny of the NR5 gene\nfamily is shown, including LRH-1s (red), SF-1s (blue), and outgroup\nsequences (black, with number of sequences analyzed shown in\nparentheses). Residues homologous to mLRH-1 positions 439, 440,\nand 443 are shown for each LRH-1/SF-1 sequence (aa). Maximum\nlikelihood reconstructions of ancestral amino acid states are shown\nfor SF-1 and LRH-1 proteins in the last common ancestor of verte-\nbrates (squares), of tetrapods (triangles), and of mammals (circles),\nas well as for the common ancestral gene preceding the duplica-\ntion that split the SF-1 and LRH-1 lineages (star). All ancestral re-\nconstructions have 100% posterior probability.

Spe-\ncies names and accession numbers are provided in Supplemental\nTable S2.\nExperimental Procedures\nProtein Purification and Crystallization\nThe mSF-1 LBD (219–462) was engineered by mutating cysteines at\n302, 408, 413, and 423 to prevent oxidation (mSF-1 residue number\nfollows accession NP_620639). Modified HIS6-tagged mSF-1 LBD\nwas expressed and purified by Ni-Trap affinity purification followed\nby cleavage of HIS-tag with recombinant tobacco etch viral prote-\nase, as previously described for mLRH-1 LBD (Sablin et al., 2003).\nHIS6-tagged hSF-1 (222–461) and hLRH-1 (300–542) were ex-\npressed using the pRSETa vector, purified by Ni-NTA chromatogra-\nphy, followed by cleavage of the HIS6-tag using thrombin. Crystalli-\nzation conditions for hSF-1 with and without\nthe coactivator\npeptide TIF-2 are described in detail in Madauss et al. (2004), and\ncrystals were obtained in 0.1 M TRIS (pH 7.8), 0.4 M MgCl , 13%\nPEG6000, 5 mM DTT. For mSF-1, equal volumes of mSF-1 LBD\nwere added to a 6-fold molar excess of mSHP-1 peptide (RPTILY-\nALLSPSPR) in 14% PEG8K, 0.1 M TRIS (pH 7.5), 5% isopropanol,\nand 15% xylitol to produce in 5 days large (200 µm) crystals that\nPhospholipids as NR5A Receptor Ligands\ndiffracted to 1.1–1.2 Å. Data were integrated using DENZO and\nscaled with SCALEPACK. For hLRH-1, the protein and TIF-2 pep-\ntide were mixed in equal volumes with 1.2 M sodium potassium\nphosphate (pH 4.9), 4% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (v/v) ethylene glycol.\nCrystals were grown at 22°C and appeared in one week and\nreached 100–200 m in each dimension over a period of 3 weeks.\nPrior to data collection, hLRH-1 crystals were dipped in cryopro-\ntectant (reservoir solution containing 11.5% glycerol and 11.5%\nethylene glycol) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The TIF-2 pep-\ntide sequence is KENALLRYLLDKDD and was used for both hLRH-1\nand hSF-1 crystallization. X-ray data were collected at IMCA 17-ID\nline (Argonne, Illinois), and data were processed and scaled with\nHKL2000. The hLRH-1 model was built by molecular replacement\nwith Amore program using hSF-1 as a search model and refined\nwith CNS. In this model, a second TIF-2 peptide is found in the\nasymmetric unit and forms loose contacts with the tail of the first\nTIF-2 peptide positioned in the coactivator cleft formed by H3, H4,\nand H12 of the hLRH-1 receptor. Rebuilding between rounds of\nrefinement was performed with the graphics program QUANTA.\nCell Culture and Transfections\nHuman HepG2 liver carcinoma cells were plated the day of trans-\nfection in 24 well plates and transfected with FUGENE 6 with\namounts of DNA indicated in figures and legends. For all experi-\nments, 200 ng/well of luciferase reporter were used and pCI-Neo-\nβ-gal (50 ng/well) were transfected along with wild-type or mutant\nreceptors. Luciferase activity was measured after 48 hr, as pre-\nviously described (Sablin et al., 2003). Expression of all mutants\nwas tested by Western blot analyses using anti-HA antibody (Co-\nvance) directed against an N-terminal tag. In all cases, mutant re-\nceptors were expressed at equivalent or higher levels than wild-\ntype protein. For N-butanol experiments, 0.1% 1-butanol was\nadded for 2 hr. All transfection experiments were done in triplicates\nand repeated at least three times; representative experiments are\nshown with standard errors indicated by bars.\nLigand Analyses and Phospholipid Binding Assays\nProtein samples were desalted and injected onto a column packed\nwith P6 gel (BioRad) to exchange nonvolatile buffers with 20 mM\nammonium acetate (pH 6.8). Buffer-exchanged protein was col-\nlected and back flushed at a flow rate of 0.75–1 µl/min into a na-\nnoflow electrospray ionization source fitted on a Waters/Micromass\nQTOF-1 (Beverly, Massachusetts) mass spectrometer. Data were col-\nlected in positive ion mode over a mass range of 1000–4000 m/z. For\nstructural determination of ligands, a similar in-gel filtration appara-\ntus was connected to an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight\nmass spectrometer (LCMSD-TOF, Agilent) and a quadrupole ion\ntrap mass spectrometer (LCMSD Trap SL, Agilent). Samples were\nexamined utilizing negative ion electrospray using conditions that\ndenatured the protein-ligand complex.\nPIP Strips   (Echelon) were first blotted for 1 hr with Casein hy-\ndrolysate (Sigma) dissolved in TBST buffer. HIS6-tagged LBD pro-\nteins were added at a concentration of 1.5 M and incubated at\n4°C overnight, followed by incubation at 25°C for 4 hr. Proteins were\ndetected with rabbit polyclonal anti-His antibody (Immunology Con-\nsultants Laboratory). For liposome preparations, lipids (4 µM) were\nmixed in chloroform/methanol and dried under reduced pressure\nto form a lipid film. Lipids were as follows: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-\nglycero-3-phosphate (PA) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-\n3-phosphocholine (PC) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,\nAlabama), and 1,2-dipalymitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol 3,4-\nbisphosphate (PI(3,4)P ) and 1,2-dipalymitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos-\nphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P ) were from Echelon\nBiosciences Inc (Salt Lake City, Utah). Liposomes were formed at\npH 7.6 TRIS buffered saline by vortexing and immersed in a bath\nsonicator for 1–2 hr under argon at room temperature to facilitate\nformation of uniformly mixed small unilamellar vesicles. Particle\nzeta average size was determined using a Malvern (Southborough,\nMassachusetts) Zeta3000 Dynamic Light Scattering Instrument.\nNeutral liposomes were prepared with 100% PC and found to be\n70.6 ± 0.4 nm. All other liposomes were prepared at a lipid ratio of\nPC:nonPC [9:1] and found to be 46.4 ± 1.4 nm for PC:PA, 37.1 ±\n3.8 nm for PC:PI(3,4)P , and 31.2 ± 1.4 nm for PC:PI(3,4,5)P . Under\nthese conditions, PI and PA lipids should mix completely into sta-\nble bilayers and consist primarily of PC. LBD proteins (2 mg/ml)\nwere exchanged into liposome buffer and combined with the lipo-\nsomes to produce a 25:1 molar ratio of PC to protein and a 2.5:1\nmolar ratio of PA, PI(3,4)P , or PI(3,4,5)P  to protein. Mixtures were\nincubated for 20 hr at room temperature, and protein was sepa-\nrated from liposomes by gel-filtration on Superdex 75 (Pharmacia),\nconcentrated, subjected to another round of gel filtration, and ana-\nlyzed by mass spectrometry as described above. The amount of\nSF-1 LBD protein associated with free liposomes (void volume) fol-\nliposome\nlowing gel filtration was determined to be <1% for all\nspecies.\nPeptide Binding Assays\nLBD proteins were serially diluted from 150 µM to 0.002 µM in bind-\ning buffer (50 mM NaPO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM\nEDTA, 0.01% NP40, 10% glycerol). Diluted protein was added to\nfluorescent coregulator peptide (20 nM) in 384 well plates yielding\nfinal protein concentrations of 75–0.001 µM and 10 nM of fluores-\ncent peptide. Samples were analyzed as previously described\n(Moore et al., 2004). Construction of 20 aa coregulator peptides\nwith the general motif of CXXXXXXXLXXL/AL/AXXXXXXX were as\nfollows: peptides were synthesized in parallel using standard fluor-\nenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry in 48 well synthesis blocks\n(FlexChem System, Robbins) (Wellings and Atherton, 1997). Cou-\npling efficiency was monitored and the completed peptides were\ncleaved from the resin, followed by reversed-phase chromatogra-\nphy and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/ESI) to purify the pep-\ntides, and are described in Moore et al. (2004).\nEvolutionary Analysis\nProtein sequences of 48 SF-1/LRH-1/FtzF1 family members with\nfull-length ligand binding domains were obtained from GenBank by\nBLAST search using Homo sapiens SF-1 as a query. Twenty addi-\ntional sequences from the closely related ERR, GCNF/GRF, and\nRXR groups (Thornton and DeSalle, 2000) were also obtained to\nserve as outgroup sequences. (See Supplemental Table S2 for ac-\ncession numbers and species names). These sequences were\naligned using ClustalX 1.83 software (Thompson et al., 1994) as-\nsuming a gap:change cost ratio of 10. The phylogeny of the gene\nfamily was then inferred from the aligned sequences using the\nBayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (Ronquist and\nHuelsenbeck, 2003) implemented in MrBayes v. 3.0 software. Tree\nand parameter space were explored with four simultaneous chains\n(three heated) for 300,000 generations each, using the Jones model\nof protein evolution with a four-category discrete γ model of\namong-site rate variation. Priors were equal for tree topologies,\nuniform (0,10) for branch lengths, and uniform (0.1, 5) for the α\nshape parameter of the γ distribution. The initial 100,000 trees, a\npoint well past stationarity, were discarded as burn-in.\nPhylogenetic reconstruction of the ancestral states at internal\nnodes for ligand binding or ligand independence, coded as a binary\ncharacter, were conducted by parsimony and maximum likelihood.\nFor the former, we used Fitch’s parsimony algorithm (Fitch, 1971)\non a simple tree consisting of the four taxa for which ligand binding\nstates are known (Sablin et al., 2003; this paper). For maximum\nlikelihood reconstruction, we calculated the likelihood of each an-\ncestral state 0 (no ligand binding) and 1 (ligand binding) as the\nprobability of evolving the terminal states in mLRH-1, hLRH-1,\nmSF-1, and hSF-1, given the phylogeny that relates these genes,\nand a simple reversible Markov process for transitions between\nstates 0 and 1 (Pagel, 1999). The probability P   of observing a state\nchange on a tree branch of length k is P   =\n−\ne  .\nBranch lengths were assumed equal a priori and scaled to their\nmaximum likelihood values by hill climbing; unknown states at in-\nternal nodes other than the NR5A ancestor were treated as nui-\nsance parameters and optimized by maximum likelihood.\nAncestral amino acid states for positions in the sequence align-\nment corresponding to 439, 440, and 443 in mLRH-1 were recon-\nstructed using the marginal Bayesian maximum likelihood method\nof Yang (Yang et al., 1995), as implemented in PAML 3.14 software,\nCell\nassuming a Jones model of amino acid evolution and a four-cate-\ngory γ model of rate variation among sites (α optimized by ML). The\ntree for ancestral state reconstruction was the maximum posterior\nprobability tree from the Bayesian analysis, adjusted at three nodes\nthat had posterior probability <0.95 to make them consistent with\nknown taxonomic relationships among species (see Supplemental\nFigure S3). Branch lengths for the ancestral reconstruction were\noptimized by maximum likelihood using PAML software.\nSupplemental Data\nSupplemental Data include three figures and two tables and can\nbe found with this article online at http://www.cell.com/cgi/\ncontent/full/120",

         "ngiotensin II and dopamine are important regulators of\nsodium and water transport across the renal proximal\ntubule (RPT).     Angiotensin II receptor subtypes (AT , AT ,\nand AT ) are expressed in brush border and basolateral\nmembranes of RPTs.    The activation of AT  receptors by\nlow concentrations of angiotensin II (picomolar) causes an\nincrease in sodium reabsorption in RPTs.      All the dopa-\nmine receptor subtypes, D -like (D  and D ) and D -like (D ,\nD , and D ) are also expressed in brush border and basolateral\nmembranes of RPTs.     In contrast to the stimulatory effect\nof AT  receptors on renal sodium transport, activation of D\nand D  receptors decreases renal sodium reabsorption.\nSeveral reports have shown an interaction between the\ndopamine and renin-angiotensin system. Intrarenally pro-\nduced angiotensin II opposes the natriuretic action of the D1-\nlike dopamine receptor agonist, fenoldopam, in rats.   D -like\nreceptor agonists also antagonize the stimulatory effect of\nangiotensin II, acting via AT  receptors, on renal proximal\ntubular luminal sodium transport.      When angiotensin II\ngeneration is inhibited or AT  receptors are blocked, the\nnatriuretic effect of dopaminergic drugs is enhanced.\nThe AT  receptor mediates the anti-natriuretic effect of\nangiotensin II, whereas the D  dopamine receptor is respon-\nsible for 80% of D -like receptor activity in RPTs.   We\nhave reported that in RPT cells of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats,\nthe D -like agonist, fenoldopam, increased D  receptor but\ndecreased AT  receptor protein expression. In contrast, in\nRPT cells of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs),\nfenoldopam also decreased AT  receptor expression but no\nlonger stimulated D  receptor expression. We also reported\nthat AT  and D  receptors coimmunoprecipitate in RPT cells;\nfenoldopam increased this coimmunoprecipitation in WKY\nRPT cells but decreased it in SHR RPT cells.   We hypoth-\nesize that the AT  receptor may also regulate the D  receptor,\nincluding its expression. Therefore, we studied the effect of\nangiotensin II on D  receptor expression and AT  and D\nreceptor interaction in immortalized rat RPT cells. We have\npreviously shown that\nthe D  receptor effects on signal\ntransduction and sodium transporters in immortalized RPT\ncells are similar to those obtained in freshly obtained renal\nproximal tubules.       Parenti et al have also reported that the\nAT  receptor behaves similarly in freshly obtained renal\ntubules and immortalized RPT cells.\nWe now report that AT  and D  receptors colocalize in RPT\ncells. D  and AT\nreceptor coimmunoprecipitation was\nin agreement with our\ngreater in WKY than in SHRs,\nprevious report.   In this earlier study, long-term fenoldopam\nstimulation (24 hours) increased the coimmunoprecipitation\nof D  and AT  receptors in WKY but decreased it in SHRs.\nWe now show that angiotensin II decreases D  and AT\ncoimmunoprecipitation similarly in WKY and SHRs. How-\never, D  receptor expression is increased by angiotensin II in\nWKY but not in SHR. In contrast, short-term angiotensin II,\nvia AT  receptors (15 minutes), decreases cell surface mem-\nbrane expression of D  receptors in WKY but not in SHRs.\nThese studies show that angiotensin II differentially affects\ntotal cellular and surface membrane D  receptor expression in\nRPT cells from WKY and SHRs.\nIn RPT cells from WKY rats, angiotensin II increased D\nreceptor expression in a concentration- and time-dependent\nM to 10   M) for 24 hours. Consistent with the results in\nFigure 1C, angiotensin II had no effect on D  receptor\nexpression in SHRs (Figure 1E).\nImmunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy revealed a co-\nlocalization of D  and AT  receptors in WKY rat RPT cells\n(Figure 2). To determine whether there is a physical interaction\nbetween the D  and the AT  receptor, additional experiments\nwere performed. As shown in Figure 3, in the basal state, the\nband of 45 kDa, representing the coimmunoprecipitated D  and\nAT  receptors, was greater in RPT cells from WKY rats (371\nDU) than in those from SHRs (233 DU, n7, P0.05),\nsimilar to the findings in our previous report.   A 24-hour\nincubation with angiotensin II (10   M) decreased D /AT\nreceptor coimmunoprecipitation to a similar degree in RPT cells\nfrom WKY rats and SHRs (WKY: control371 density units\n(DU), angiotensin II282 DU; SHRs: control233 DU,\nangiotensin II173 DU; n7, P0.05).\nmanner. The stimulatory effect was evident at 10   M (Figure\n1A) as early as 16 hours and maintained for at least 30 hours\n(Figure 1B). Consistent with the stimulatory effect of angio-\ntensin II on D  receptor expression (Figure 1A and 1B), a 24\nhour-incubation with angiotensin II (10   M) increased D\nreceptors in RPT cells from WKY rats. In contrast, this effect\nwas not observed in RPT cells from SHRs (WKY: con-\ntrol0.770.15, angiotensin II1.330.19; SHR: con-\ntrol0.870.13, angiotensin II1.040.17; n7) (Figure 1C).\nTo determine the specificity of angiotensin II action on\nAT  receptors, we studied the effect o",

         "The expression of cytokeratins in gastrointestinal stromal\ntumours (GISTs) is rare and may lead to diagnostic confusion\nwhen it occurs. This report describes a metastatic GIST that\nstained strongly for cytokeratins, CD117, and CD34 in a\npatient who was previously diagnosed with gastric epithe-\nlioid angiosarcoma. A review of both tumours showed the\nsame histological and immunohistochemical profiles, and\nc-kit molecular analysis revealed an insertional mutation at\ncodon 558 of exon 11 in both tumours. Thus, pathologists\nshould be aware that GISTs can occasionally express\ncytokeratins, and that c-kit mutational\ninvestigations may\nhave a key diagnostic role and may prevent diagnostic\nmistakes that could have important clinical implications.\nastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most\ncommon mesenchymal neoplasms of the digestive\ntract.  The identification of KIT (CD117) as a specific\nimmunohistochemical marker,    together with the discovery\nof gain of function mutations in the protooncogene c-kit in\nmost GISTs    represent crucial steps in the definition of this\ntumour as a biologically distinctive malignancy and, most\nimportantly, in the development of an alternative therapeutic\napproach using targeted treatment with a specific KIT\ninhibitor,\nimatinib mesylate (formerly known as STI571,\nGlivecH).\n‘‘Gastrointestinal stromal tumours are the most common\nmesenchymal neoplasms of the digestive tract’’\nIn routine practice, when faced with a soft tissue tumour of\nthe gastrointestinal tract, surgical pathologists usually use a\nsmall immunohistochemical panel of antibodies to support\nthe morphological picture, including CD117, CD34, smooth\nmuscle actin, desmin, and S-100 protein.  In fact, almost all\nGISTs are CD117 positive and about 60–70% are CD34\nimmunopositive, whereas the other markers are usually\nnegative.  In this context, immunostaining for cytokeratins\nmay be helpful to rule out the possibility of a sarcomatoid\ncarcinoma, because GISTs are usually negative for epithelial\nmarkers.\nHere, we describe a gastric GIST initially diagnosed as\nepithelioid angiosarcoma which metastasised to the pelvis\nand strongly expressed cytokeratins and CD117.

Her medical history revealed that four\nyears previously she had undergone total gastrectomy plus\nomentectomy at another hospital for a gastric malignancy\nfor which she\ndiagnosed as epithelioid angiosarcoma,\nreceived adjuvant chemotherapy (doxorubicin and ifosfa-\nmide). Based on her previous diagnosis, metastatic disease\nwas clinically suspected. Abdominal ultrasonography and a\ncomputerised tomography scan confirmed the presence of a\nlarge (8 cm across) solid mass in the right iliac region and\na partially cystic mass (6 cm) in the left one. Radiological\ninvestigations revealed no significant signs in the other\nabdominal organs or regional lymph nodes. A chest x ray was\nunremarkable. Tumour markers (CA125 and carcinoembryo-\nnic antigen) and laboratory studies were negative. The\npatient then underwent complete surgical excision of the\npelvic masses and right adnexectomy. The surgical specimen,\nroutinely formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded, grossly\nshowed a grey/whitish cut surface with bloody areas.

         "Successful animal cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer\n(NT) has been reported in large domestic species (Wilmut\net al. 1997, Kato et al. 1998, Baguisi et al. 1999, Onishi\net al. 2000, Galli et al. 2003). As for small rodents,\nWakayama et al. (1998) were the ﬁrst to produce cloned\nmice using G0/G1-phase cumulus cells, and very recently\nZhou et al. (2003) reported the production of fertile cloned\nrats using M-phase fetal ﬁbroblast cells. However, the suc-\ncess rates of producing cloned rodents by NT are still low.\nIn the mouse, nuclei injected into enucleated oocyte\ncytoplasm are directly exposed to reprogramming factors,\nresulting in premature chromosome condensation (PCC),\nwith subsequent multiple pseudo-pronuclei formation fol-\nlowing activation (Wakayama et al. 1998, 1999, Ogura\net al. 2000). It is considered in rodents, at least, that PCC\nis a critical aspect contributing to successful cloning\n(Wakayama et al. 1999, Ogura et al. 2000). However,\nPCC is not essential for somatic cell cloning in all species,\nsince telophase-II\n(TII) oocytes have promoted embryo\ndevelopment in goats (Baguisi et al. 1999) and cattle (Kur-\nosaka et al. 2002).\nThere is a major difference between mouse and rat, in\nthe behavior of somatic nuclei upon exposure to oocyte\ncytoplasm. We have reported that the PCC of both mouse\nand rat cumulus cell nuclei occurred in enucleated mouse\noocytes but not at all\nin enucleated rat oocytes\n(Hirabayashi et al. 2003a). Even if cumulus nuclei were\ninjected into the rat oocytes without enucleation, the rate\nof PCC formation was less than half (Hirabayashi et al.\n2003b).\nWe also reported that\nthe ability of rat oocytes to\npromote PCC of the injected nuclei was dependent on\nthe characteristics of the oocytes, such as age (4- to 5-\nweek-old, superior to .10-week-old rats) or strain of the\ndonor rats (Wistar and LEW, superior to the Donryu and\nF344 strains) and the timing of oocyte recovery (14 h post-\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), superior to 17 h\npost hCG) (Hirabayashi et al. 2003b). In the same study,\nthe time management of NT completion (less than 45 min\nafter donor animal killing) and addition to the oocyte-\nhandling media\nof N-acetylleucylleucylnorleucinal\n(ALLN), a neutral cysteine protease inhibitor, were also\nfound important for intact rat oocytes to promote PCC.\nThe successful production of cloned rats (Zhou et al.\n2003) may be attributed to injecting the metaphase-\narrested fetal ﬁbroblasts into oocytes treated with MG132,\na proteasome inhibitor, followed by quick removal of the\nrecipient metaphase-plate. Therefore, it is a possibility that\nrecipient oocytes arrested at the metaphase-II (MII) stage\nby the inhibition of protein degradation have essential\nroles in nuclear reprogramming including PCC formation.\nOvulated rat oocytes are known to activate spon-\ntaneously but abortively during in vitro culture (Zernicka-\nGoetz 1991). We also conﬁrmed that more than half of\nthe oocytes from Wistar rats progressed to anaphase-II\n(AII)/TII stages at 70 min after killing of\nthe donor rats\n(Kato et al. 2001). In vertebrate oocytes, it has been con-\nsidered that high activity of maturation promoting factor\n(MPF) affects the chromosome condensation and the\nmaintenance of the meiotic spindle, both of which are\ninvolved in the meiotic arrest at\nthe MII stage (Jones\n2004). MPF is a heterodimer composed of p34     kinase\nand cyclin B1, controlling the cell cycle. When the\nactivity was inactivated by the degradation of cyclin B\n(Nurse 1990), oocytes were released from the arrest at the\nMII stage. The p34     kinase in oocytes was maintained\nat a high level until ovulation in many species (Kubiak\net al. 1993, Naito et al. 1995, Abrieu et al. 2001, Ito &\nShimada 2005), suggesting that p34     kinase activity in\nrat ovulated oocytes was rapidly decreased in vitro. More-\nover, destruction of\nthe nuclear envelope in mitotic\nsomatic cells occurred during the G2/M-phase transition\nby p34     kinase-related phosphorylation of lamin, which\nis one of\nthe nuclear membrane proteins (Peter et al.\n1990). It has been reported that ALLN, which was used in\nour previous study (Hirabayashi et al. 2003b), has an\neffect on the inhibition of cyclin B destruction (Sherwood\net al. 1993). Therefore, it is possible that the low rate of\nPCC of injected somatic cell nuclei resulted from rapidly\ndecreasing p34     kinase activity in rat ovulated oocytes,\nwhile direct evidence that p34     kinase activity is\ninvolved in the PCC incidence has not yet been shown.\nClarifying the relationship between p34     kinase activity\nand PCC incidence would contribute to understanding the\nreprogramming mechanism in mammalian\nnuclear\noocytes.\nIn the present study, two experiments were conducted\nto examine the effects of in vitro aging and enucleation of\nrat oocytes on the kinetics of p34     kinase and the inci-\ndence of PCC of microinjected cumulus cell nuclei, with\nsome comparisons with mouse oocytes. In addition, two\nmore experiments were conducted to explain a possible\nrole of p34     kinase for promoting PCC, by treatment of\nthe rat oocytes with roscovitine, an inhibitor of p34\nkinase (Lazar et al. 2002), and MG132, a proteasome\ninhibitor which has an effect on the inhibition of cyclin\nB1 degradation (Josefsberg et al. 2000).\nSpeciﬁc-pathogen-free Crj:Wistar female rats (3 –5 weeks\nold) or Crj:BDF1 female mice (7 weeks old) were pur-\nchased from Charles River Japan, Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan).\nThey were housed under controlled lighting (lights on at\ntemperature (23 ^ 2 8C) and humidity\n0600 –1800 h),\n(55 ^ 5%), with free access\n(MF;\nOriental Yeast Co., Tokyo, Japan) and water. Rats were\nsuperovulated by i.p. injections of 30 IU equine chorio-\nnic gonadotropin (eCG) (Nippon Zenyaku, Co., Fukush-\nima, Japan) and 30 IU hCG (Sankyo Yell Yakuhin, Co.,\nTokyo, Japan) at 48 h intervals (Hirabayashi et al. 2001).\nMice were superovulated as well with 5 IU eCG and 5\nIU hCG.\nto laboratory diet\nFourteen hours after the hCG injection, cumulus –oocyte\ncomplexes (COCs) were collected from the oviductal\nampullae of donor rats or mice with modiﬁed Krebs–\nRinger bicarbonate solution (mKRB) in Experiments 1 and\n3 (Toyoda & Chang 1974) and modiﬁed rat one-cell\nembryo culture medium (mR1ECM) in Experiments 2, 4\nand 5 (Oh et al. 1998) supplemented with 0.1% hyaluroni-\ndase (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St Louis, MO, USA) respect-\nively. Two to ﬁve minutes later, the denuded oocytes were\nwashed three times with fresh mKRB or R1ECM and kept in\nthe same medium at 37 8C until being subjected to the\ntreatments. The time of killing of the donor animals was\ndeﬁned as 0 min, and it usually took 10 –15 min from the\nanimal killing to the preparation of denuded oocytes.\nThe p34     kinase assay was performed according to the\nmethod as described by Ito et al. (2001) with some modiﬁ-\ncations. In brief, the oocytes were washed several times\nwith PBS and placed into cell lysis buffer composed of\n20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1%\nTriton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM b-gly-\ncerophosphate, 1 mM Na VO , 1 mg/ml\nleupeptin (all\nchemicals from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA,\nUSA) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (Sigma-\nAldrich). The oocyte lysates were stored at 2 80 8C until\nthe ELISA assay.\n(pH 7.5)\n(MBL, Nagoya,\nThe lysate (ten oocytes/5 ml cell lysis buffer) was mixed\nwith 45 ml of kinase assay buffer-A composed of 25 mM\nHepes buffer\nJapan), 10 mM\nMgCl  (MBL), 10% (v/v) mouse vimentin peptide solution\n(SLYSSPGGAYC) (MBL) and 0.1 mM ATP (Sigma-Aldrich),\nand the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 8C. The\nreaction was terminated by the addition of 200 ml PBS\ncontaining 50 mM EGTA (MBL). The phosphorylation of\nmouse vimentin peptides was detected using an ELISA\nanalysis (MESACUP cdc2 kinase assay kit\n(code no.\n5234); MBL). Data were expressed in terms of the strength\nof p34     kinase activity in denuded rat oocytes 15 min\n(Experiments 1, 3 and 4) or 45 min (Experiment 2) after\nanimal killing.\nRat oocytes immediately after recovery and 30, 60, 90\nand 120 min after culture in mKRB were stained with\n5 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich). Their nuclear\nconﬁguration was then assessed under UV light at 330–\n380 nm, according to the classiﬁcations reported pre-\nviously (Kato et al. 2001): MII, characterized by a meta-\nphase spindle with the ﬁrst polar body; AII, characterized\nby elongated spindle without the second polar body; and\nTII, characterized by elongated spindle with extrusion of\nthe second polar body.\nCumulus cells dispersed from COCs by the hyaluronidase\ntreatment were placed in mKRB (Experiments 1 and 3) or\nR1ECM (Experiments 2, 4 and 5) containing 22 mM Hepes\nand 5 mM NaHCO  (abbreviated hereafter as Hepes-\nmKRB and Hepes-R1ECM respectively). An aliquot (2 ml)\nof the cumulus cell suspension was transferred to 10 ml of\nHepes-mKRB or Hepes-R1ECM supplemented with 12%\nw/v 360 kDa polyvinylpyrrolidone (ICN Pharmaceuticals,\nInc., Costa Mesa, CA, USA). Nuclei were removed from\ncumulus cells and gently aspirated in and out of the injec-\ntion pipette (7 –10 mm) until\ntheir nuclei were largely\ndevoid of visible cytoplasmic materials. Each nucleus was\ninjected into a separate enucleated oocyte within 5 min of\nits isolation, as described by Kimura & Yanagimachi\n(1995). One hour after the nuclear injection, the oocytes\nwere stained with 5 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 and evaluated\nfor incidence of PCC under UV light at 330–380 nm, as\ndescribed previously (Hirabayashi et al. 2003a,b). The\ninjected somatic cell nucleus was distinguished from the\noocyte nucleus by the position of the opening in the zona\npellucida at the nuclear microinjection site.\nThe effect of in vitro aging on the p34     kinase activity\nand the PCC incidence was investigated using rat oocytes.\nTen oocytes for each test were sampled for\nin vitro\np34     kinase assay immediately after recovery (15 min\ngroup), and after culture for 30 min (45 min group), 60 min\n(75 min group) or 105 min (120 min group) in mKRB at\n37 8C in 5% CO  in air. Nuclear conﬁguration of\nthe\noocytes was also examined immediately after recovery\nand every subsequent 30 min up to 120 min. The other\noocytes were placed in Hepes-mKRB, and the cumulus\ncell nuclei were then injected into the oocytes up to\n120 min. The injected oocytes were divided into two\ngroups based on the time from the animal killing to NT\ncompletion (15 –45 min group and 46 – 120 min group).\nThe incidence of PCC was evaluated 1 h after the last\ninjection among each group.\nThe effect of oocyte enucleation on the p34     kinase\nactivity and the PCC incidence was investigated using\nboth rat and mouse oocytes. For the in vitro p34\nkinase assay, oocytes derived from the same donor rats\nand mice were allocated to the non-enucleation group\nand the enucleation group, and the non-enucleated and\nenucleated oocytes were sampled 45 min after the animal\nkilling. Enucleation was performed by aspiration of the\nmetaphase-plate with a part of the volume (,10–20%) of\ncytoplasm in Hepes-R1ECM containing\nsurrounding\n5 mg/ml cytochalasin B (Sigma-Aldrich). In addition to the\nnon-enucleation and enucleation groups, denuded rat\noocytes were allocated to a cytoplasm-removal group\n(a part of the cytoplasm was mechanically aspirated as a\nsham control.). All the treatments were completed within\n45 min. The oocyte samples were harvested at 45, 75, 90\nand 105 min (0, 30, 45 and 60 min after enucleation\nrespectively). For PCC evaluation, nuclear injection into\nnon-enucleated and enucleated mouse and rat oocytes,\nand into cytoplasm-removed rat oocytes, was completed\nwithin 45 min after animal killing.\nWe investigated whether the decreased level of p34\nkinase activity in non-enucleated rat oocytes negatively\naffected the PCC incidence of injected cell nuclei. Ros-\ncovitine (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO\nand stored at 2 80 8C, a speciﬁc inhibitor of p34\nkinase, was added to all media throughout the process of\noocyte recovery and the in vitro culture at the ﬁnal con-\ncentration of 150 mM, as reported by Lazar et al. (2002).\nOocytes were sampled for in vitro p34     kinase assay at\n15 (immediately after recovery), 45, 75 and 120 min as in\nExperiment 1. Because the 45 min treatment of rat oocytes\nwith 150 mM roscovitine decreased their p34     kinase\nactivity to an equivalent level of oocytes 120 min after in\nvitro aging or 60 min after enucleation, nuclear injection\ninto the roscovitine-treated oocytes was performed within\n45 min, and the incidence of PCC was then evaluated\nafter a further 1 h.\nWe investigated whether the treatment of rat oocytes with a\nproteasome inhibitor, by which the p34     kinase activity\nwould be maintained, could support the PCC incidence of\nthe injected donor cell nuclei. MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich), an\ninhibitor which can block cyclin B1 degradation, was used\nat the ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM, as reported by Josefsberg\net al. (2000). Non-enucleated oocytes were exposed to\nMG132,\nthe process of oocyte recovery to\nin vitro culture or nuclear injection. Oocyte sampling for\nin vitro p34     kinase assay was performed at 15 min\n(immediately after recovery), 45, 75 and 120 min. Nuclear\ninjection into the MG132-treated oocytes and PCC evalu-\nation were performed as in Experiment 3.\nthroughout\nIn the ﬁrst group, oocytes exposed to MG132 from oocyte\nrecovery to just before enucleation were used as recipi-\nents. From the result of Experiment 4, MG132 treatment is\nexpected to support PCC even in enucleated oocytes,\nbecause the p34     kinase activity was maintained at a\nhigh level during the treatment. The procedure of enuclea-\ntion was as described above. The cytoplasts were then\ninjected with cumulus cell nuclei. One hour later, a high\nincidence of PCC was expected.\nIn the second group,\noocytes with the extrusion of a second polar body were\nselected from 2 h cultures of non-treated oocytes, and\nthen enucleated and nuclear injected as well. The reduced\nincidence of PCC under a lowered MPF was expected. For\nboth groups, the oocytes 1 h after nuclear injection were\nactivated by two direct current pulses (100 V/mm, 99 ms)\nand 4 h treatment with 2 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine\n(6-DMAP)\nin mR1ECM medium. The\nreconstructed oocytes were cultured in 100 ml microdrops\nof mR1ECM at 37 8C in 5% CO  in air, and number of\noocytes forming one or two pseudo-pronuclei and cleav-\ning to the two-cell stage was recorded at 6 and 24 h of\nculture respectively.\n(Sigma-Aldrich)\nEach experiment had at least three replicates. Data on\np34     kinase activity were compared by ANOVA and\nFisher’s protected least signiﬁcant difference test using the\nStatView program (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA,\nUSA). Data on PCC incidence and NT embryo develop-\nment were compared by Fisher’s exact probability test. A\nvalue of P , 0.05 was chosen as an indication of statisti-\ncal signiﬁcance.\nThe time-dependent change in p34     kinase activity in\nrat oocytes is shown in Fig. 1. The p34     kinase activity\nof\nrat oocytes decreased signiﬁcantly at 45 min (after\n30 min cultivation) and more signiﬁcantly at 75 min (after\n60 min cultivation). The decreased activity was maintained\nuntil 120 min (after 105 min cultivation). Probably due to\nthe decrease of p34     kinase activity, the release from\nmeiotic arrest of ovulated oocytes occurred in a time-\ndependent manner, as shown in Fig. 2. Within 75 min\nafter animal killing, more than half of the oocytes pro-\ngressed beyond the MII stage. At 135 min, most of the\noocytes were at either the AII or the TII stage. The pro-\nportion of in vitro-aged rat oocytes promoting PCC of the\ninjected cumulus cell nuclei is shown in Table 1. When\nnuclear injection was completed within 45 min from ani-\nmal killing, a positive sign of PCC was observed in 32.5%\nof the NT oocytes. On the other hand, PCC occurred in\nonly 2.6% of the oocytes into which cumulus cell nuclei\nwere injected between 46 and 120 min.\nThe activities of p34     kinase in non-enucleated and\nenucleated oocytes within 45 min were compared in rats\nand mice, as shown in Fig. 3. In both species, there was\na slight decrease in the p34     kinase activity after enu-\ncleation in both rat and mouse oocytes. A considerable\ntreatment (enucleation or cytoplasm removal) is shown in\nTable 2. In rats, despite little reduction of p34     kinase\nactivity, few of the oocytes that either had a small portion\nof cytoplasm-removed (17.1%) or the non-treated controls\n(28.2%) could support PCC at 105 min after animal\nin the\nkilling. However, PCC was not observed at all\nfound in the p34     kinase activity\ndifference was\nbetween rat and mouse oocytes, because the mouse\noocytes carried a p34     kinase activity 2.5 times that of\nrat oocytes either immediately or up to 60 min after enu-\ncleation or cytoplasm removal and compared with non-\ntreated, age-matched controls, as shown in Fig. 4. The\nactivities of p34     kinase were measured in rat oocytes\nimmediately after or 60 min after one of three treatments\n(enucleated, cytoplasm-removed and non-treated), as\nshown in Fig. 4. Surprisingly, a higher p34     kinase\nactivity was detected in the oocytes immediately after\nenucleation, although the p34     kinase activity of\noocytes immediately after cytoplasm removal was not\nfrom that of non-treated oocytes. The p34\ndifferent\nin enucleated oocytes dramatically\nactivity\nkinase\ndecreased within 30 min after enucleation. At 45 min\nafter enucleation, the activity was further decreased and\nthereafter maintained until 60 min. However, the activity\nin non-treated or cytoplasm-removed oocytes did not sig-\nniﬁcantly differ by 60 min. The proportion of rat and\nmouse oocytes promoting PCC in relation to mechanical\nenucleated oocytes where p34     kinase activity was sig-\nniﬁcantly decreased at 60 min after completion of enu-\ncleation. In contrast, PCC of mouse cumulus cell nuclei\noccurred in most of the mouse oocytes before enucleation\n(96.7%) and even after enucleation (93.1%).\nThe time-dependent decrease of p34     kinase activity in\nroscovitine-treated rat oocytes is shown in Fig. 5. The\nactivity\nlinearly\nin roscovitine-treated oocytes was\ndecreased until 75 min and maintained until 120 min.\nAt 45, 75 and 120 min, each activity in the roscovitine-\ntreated oocytes was signiﬁcantly lower than that of non-\ntreated control oocytes. The result of PCC incidence in the\noocytes treated with or without roscovitine for 45 min is\nshown in Table 3. None of the roscovitine-treated oocytes\npromoted PCC, although 41.7% of non-treated oocytes\npromoted it.\nThe activities of p34     kinase in MG132-treated rat\noocytes are shown in Fig. 6. The level of p34     kinase\nactivity still decreased in the MG132-treated oocytes\nafter 30 min of culture, but were signiﬁcantly greater\nthan in control oocytes. The p34     kinase activity was\nmaintained during the further incubation up to 105 min.\nThe kinase activities of MG132-treated oocytes at 60\nand 105 min cultivation were signiﬁcantly greater than\nthose of control oocytes. As shown in Table 4, the pro-\nportion of MG132-treated oocytes promoting PCC\n(66.0%) was higher than that of the non-treated oocytes\n(46.5%) when the nuclear\ninjection was completed\nwithin 45 min.\nthe reconstructed embryos\nAfter oocyte activation with the electrical stimulus plus 6-\nDMAP,\nfrom both groups\n(MG132-treated MII oocytes and non-treated TII oocytes\nat the enucleation) formed one or two pseudo-pronuclei\n(91.7 and 87.5% in total respectively). After activation, a\ngreater proportion of oocytes enucleated at the MII stage\ntended to form two pseudo-pronuclei compared with\nthose enucleated at the TII stage. A signiﬁcantly higher\nproportion of the NT embryos in the MG132-treated group\nvs the non-treated group (59.1 vs 7.1%) developed to the\ntwo-cell stage.\nRat oocytes have poor potential\nfor promoting PCC of\ninjected somatic cell nuclei, and the rate was markedly\ndecreased in aged or enucleated oocytes (Hirabayashi\nIn the present study, rat oocytes into\net al. 2003a,b).\nwhich cumulus cell nuclei were injected within 45 min\nthe non-treated oocytes during the same period, may\ninﬂuence the outcome of PCC. The high concentration of\nroscovitine affects the other cyclin-dependent protein\nkinases such as cdk2 (De Azevado et al. 1997). The\nunknown pathway and/or chemical toxicity of roscovitine\ncannot be ruled out\nfor complete suppression of PCC\ninduction. Moreover, the level of activity in rat oocytes\nwas less than half compared with that in mouse oocytes,\nwhich had a high potential for promoting PCC. Judging\nfrom these results, we estimated that the high activity of\np34     kinase is associated with promoting PCC of\ninjected somatic cell nuclei, and the low level of p34\nkinase activity is one of the reasons for the poor potential\nto promote PCC in rat oocytes compared with that of\nmouse oocytes. The reason why the potential\nlevel of\np34     kinase activity is different between mouse and rat\noocytes remains unclear. Our previous study indicated, at\nleast, that the PCC-inducing potential is determined by\nthe origin of the recipient cytoplasm, not by the origin of\nin the interspecies NT experiment\nthe donor nucleus,\nbetween mouse and rat\nIn\n(Hirabayashi et al. 2003a).\nsomatic cell division, dissolution of the nuclear envelope\noccurs during G2/M transition in mitosis (Nurse 1990) and\nis induced by phosphorylation of lamin, one of the major\nnuclear membrane proteins (Peter et al. 1990). In oocytes,\np34     kinase had the potential to phosphorylate lamins,\ninducing meiotic breakdown of the nuclear envelope and\nthe meiotic resumption (Dessev & Goldman 1988). There-\nfore, it is possible that p34     kinase plays an important\nrole in the destruction of the nuclear membrane of the\ninjected somatic cell through phosphorylation of lamin.\nOne possible pathway known for inactivation of p34\nkinase is the calmodulin-dependent pathway via Ca  .\nWe have reported that the Ca  -dependent pathway trig-\ngers the degradation of cyclin B and results in inactivation\nof p34     kinase in porcine oocytes (Ito et al. 2003,\n2004a). In Xenopus oocytes (Lorca et al. 1994, Morin et al.\n1994), activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase\nII induces the degradation of cyclin B via the ubiquitin\nproteasome pathway. Based on these literature sources\nand preliminary data, we have investigated the effect of a\nproteasome inhibitor MG132 on p34     kinase activity\nand PCC incidence. The PCC incidence in rat oocytes was\nsigniﬁcantly improved by MG132 treatment (Table 4). This\nresult matched well with the report by Josefsberg et al.\n(2000), who demonstrated that MG132-treated rat oocytes\ncontained a high amount of cyclin B1.\nIn the present\nstudy, MG132 also provided a suppressive effect on inacti-\nvation of p34     kinase (Fig. 6). Use of ALLN, a neutral\ncysteine protease inhibitor, was also slightly effective for\nimproving the PCC incidence in rat oocytes (Hirabayashi\net al. 2003b). Thus, the Ca  -dependent degradation path-\nway, which may induce a decrease in the cyclin B1 level,\nis activated in aged rat oocytes, which results in a low\nlevel of p34     kinase activity, and a low potential\nto promote PCC. Our unpublished data (M Hirabayashi\nand J Ito, unpublished data) showing that the decreased\nIn mouse oocytes, PCC was initiated at\npromoted PCC (frequency 28–47% in Tables 1 –4), but\nthe incidence of PCC decreased with oocyte aging with a\nsigniﬁcant decrease in p34     kinase activity (Table 1,\nFig. 1).\nleast\n30 min after nuclear injection and lasted until 2 h (Chen\net al. 2004), therefore the timing of PCC observation in\nthe present study (60 min after nuclear injection) might be\noptimal. When oocytes are treated with roscovitine,\nwhich decreases the level of p34     kinase activity, PCC\nformation was never observed even though nuclear injec-\ntion is completed within 45 min. Roscovitine is widely\nused as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor\nto suppress\np34     kinase in rodent oocytes (Phillips et al. 2002).\nTherefore, the rapid decrease of p34     kinase activity in\nthe roscovitine-treated oocytes found between 45 and\n75 min (Fig. 5), when compared with the slow decrease in\nconcentration of extracellular free calcium in the handling\nmedium partially inhibits spontaneous activation of rat\noocytes, support this hypothesis.\nThe other pathway for inactivation by phosphorylation\nof   Thr and   Tyr of p34     kinase has been reported in\naged porcine oocytes (Kikuchi et al. 2000). In the same\nstudy, it has been reported that caffeine suppressed the\nfrom MPF to pre-MPF (  Thr/  Tyr-phosphorylated\nshift\np34     kinase þ cyclin B1) in the aged porcine oocytes.\nOkadaic acid is also known as a protein phosphatase\ninhibitor which prevents phosphorylation of   Thr and\nTyr of p34     kinase (Rime et al. 1995). In our prelimi-\nnary study, PCC incidence of injected cumulus cell nuclei\nwas slightly improved in rat oocytes treated with okadaic\nacid (M Hirabayashi and J Ito, unpublished data). There-\nfore, the phosphorylation of p34     kinase as well as the\ncyclin degradation may be involved in spontaneous acti-\nvation of rat oocytes during in vitro culture.\nThe level of p34     kinase activity in non-treated rat\noocytes was similar to that of cytoplasm-removed or enu-\ncleated oocytes in the case where the oocytes were\nsampled immediately after the treatment\n(Fig. 4). The\nmechanical puncture of the oocyte membrane and the\naspiration of the cytoplasm or karyoplast did not inﬂuence\nthe p34     kinase activity immediately after the enuclea-\ntion procedure beyond the level expected from the rela-\ntive volume of aspirated cytoplasm (, 10–20%). These\nresults strongly suggest that active p34     kinase is not\naccumulated near the metaphase spindles in rat oocytes.\nThere was signiﬁcant difference in the p34     kinase\nactivity between 45 and 75 min in both non-treated and\nenucleated groups (Fig. 4). A dramatic decrease in the\nactivity of p34     kinase was observed in the rat oocytes\nenucleated and cultured for 30 min compared with the\nnon-treated group (Fig. 4), suggesting that\nthe oocyte\nmetaphases per se are involved in the maintenance of\np34     kinase activity. We have previously reported in\nporcine oocytes that activation of p34     kinase was\ndependent on the synthesis of cyclin B and that the syn-\nthesis was induced by the activation of mitogen-activated\nprotein (MAP) kinase (Ito et al. 2004b). The MAP kinase\nsuppressed Myt1 activity that phosphorylated p34\nkinase at   Thr and   Tyr (Mueller et al. 1995, Palmer et al.\n1998). Because activated MAP kinase is localized on the\nmeiotic spindle in porcine oocytes (Lee et al. 2000), it is\npossible that enucleation results in the loss of MAP kinase\nfrom the recipient oocytes.\nNuclear\ninjection into the MG132-treated, MII-enu-\ncleated rat oocytes resulted in a higher development to\nthe two-cell stage when compared with non-treated, TII-\nenucleated rat oocytes after 24 h cultivation (Table 5).\nThe favorable circumstance of recipient cytoplasm with\na high MPF activity must induce PCC and promote sub-\nsequent development of NT embryos. Wakayama &\nYanagimachi\nthe injected\n(2001) reported in mice that\ncumulus cell nuclei undergoing PCC transformation to\nthe two pseudo-pronuclei and such NT embryos are able\nto develop to full-term. In contrast, a different situation\nhas been reported in the cloning of large domestic ani-\nmals. The somatic cell NT in the livestock species is suc-\ncessfully reproducible when enucleated and activated\noocytes with a low MPF activity are used as recipient\ncytoplasm (Baguisi et al. 1999, Kurosaka et al. 2002,\nShin et al. 2002).

In generic systems of the form (1) depending on one control parameter\n(i.e. with m = 1) a hyperbolic limit cycle exists for an open interval of parameter values p. At a boundary of\nsuch an interval, the limit cycle may become non-hyperbolic, so that either a cycle limit point (saddle-node),\nor a period-doubling (ﬂip), or a torus (Neimark-Sacker) bifurcation occurs. In two-parameter generic systems\n(1) (i.e. with m = 2) these bifurcations happen at certain curves in the parameter plane. These curves of\ncodim 1 bifurcations can meet tangentially or intersect transversally at some codim 2 points characterized\nby a double degeneracy of the limit cycle, which play the role of organizing centers for local dynamics, i.e.\nnear the critical cycle and for nearby parameter values. In some cases, such codim 2 bifurcations imply the\nappearance of “chaotic motions”.\nThe codim 2 bifurcations of limit cycles in generic systems (1) are well understood with the help of\nthe corresponding Poincar´e maps and their normal forms (see for example [22, 20, 3, 29, 18]). However,\napplications of these results to the analysis of concrete systems (1) are exceptional, since they require\naccurate higher-order derivatives of the Poincar´e map which are hardly available numerically [42, 19, 21, 32].\nWe note that there exists software, e.g. CAPD [1], TIDES [2, 5] that allows to compute up to any\nprecision level the solution of an ODE using a Taylor series method in a variable stepsize - variable order\nformulation. It can also compute, up to any order, the partial derivatives of the solution with respect to the\ninitial conditions. When applied to compute a periodic orbit by a shooting method, this will also provide\nthe derivatives of the Poincar´e map.\nThough this is a valuable approach in the case of a single periodic orbit, it is neither practical nor eﬃcient\nin a continuation context since the periodic orbits are not obtained as the solution to a set of equations. Also,\nthe shooting method does not have the high order convergence properties of the method of approximation by\npiecewise polynomials with collocation in the Gauss points that is routinely used in standard software such\nas auto [14], content [31], and matcont [11, 10]. Moreover, the number of derivatives of the Poincar´e\nmap to be computed is O(n ) if derivatives up to order k are needed (in several cases k = 5). Even for\nmoderate values of n this involves a great deal of unnecessary work since in our situation the normal form\nitself is known in advance and we need only compute its coeﬃcients. We will show that this can be done\nwithout computing the derivatives of the Poincar´e map.\nIndeed, recently an alternative numerical method to analyse codim 1 limit cycle bifurcations has been\nIt is based on the periodic normalization proposed in [25, 23, 24]\ndeveloped and implemented in [30].\nInstead, the\nand completely avoids the numerical computation of Poincar´e maps and their derivatives.\ncomputation of the normal form coeﬀcients is reduced to solving certain linear boundary value problems\n(BVP), where only the partial derivatives of the RHS of (1) are used [17, 16, 28]. In our implementation in\nMATCONT, we discretize these BVPs by orthogonal collocation with piecewise-polynomial functions.\nIn the present paper, we apply the approach developed in [30] to codim 2 bifurcations of limit cycles.\nIt should be noted that already in [7] normal forms for some codim 2 bifurcations of cycles in (1) were\nderived, while [23] contains the periodic normal forms for many codim 2 bifurcations of cycles, as well as\na general normalization technique applicable at any codimension. However, in neither of these publications\nexplicit formulas for the normal form coeﬃcients were given. The derivation of such formulas is the primary\ncontribution of this paper.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we ﬁx notation and list the periodic normal forms for\ncodim 2 bifurcations of limit cycles. Then we derive explicit formulas to compute the critical normal form\ncoeﬃcients for these bifurcations, which we order by the dimension n  of the cycle center manifold (i.e. the\n= 1). We restrict to the cases n  = 2 and 3. The formulas are\ntotal number of critical multipliers with\nindependent of the dimension of the phase space and involve solutions of certain BVPs on the interval [0, T ],\nwhere T is the period of the critical cycle, as well as multilinear functions from the Taylor expansion of the\nright-hand sides of (1) near the cycle. A derivation of the critical periodic normal forms based on [23] is\ngiven in Appendix A, while their relationships with the normal forms of the Poincar´e maps are discussed in\nAppendix B.\nµ\n|\n|\nWrite (1) at the critical parameter values as\n(2)\n˙u = F (u),\nand suppose that there is a limit cycle Γ corresponding to a periodic solution u (t) = u (t + T ), where T > 0\nis its (minimal) period.

There is always a\nµ\n“trivial” critical multiplier µ  = 1. We denote the total number of critical multipliers by n  and assume that\nthe limit cycle is non-hyperbolic, i.e. n  > 1. In this case, there exists an invariant n -dimensional critical\ncenter manifold W  (Γ)\nR  near Γ .\n|\n|\nIt is well known [3, 29], that in generic two-parameter systems (1) only eleven codim 2 bifurcations\noccur. To describe the normal forms of (2) on the critical center manifold W  (Γ) for these codim 2 cases, we\nparameterize W  (Γ) near Γ by (τ, ξ), where τ\nand ξ is a real or complex vector,\n[0, kT ] for k\ndepending on the bifurcation. It follows from [23] that it is possible to select the τ - and ξ-coordinates so\nthat the restriction of (2) to the corresponding critical center manifold W  (Γ) with n  = 2 or n  = 3 will\ntake one of the following periodic normal forms (for derivation see Appendix A). In Section 3 we will see\nthat in two cases, namely the cusp of cycles bifurcation and the fold-ﬂip bifurcation, a further simpliﬁcation\nis possible in the normal form, and more speciﬁcally in the transformation of time.\n1, 2, 3, 4\n∈ {\n∈\n}\n⊂\nWe list here the critical periodic normal forms with n  = 2 and brieﬂy describe bifurcations in their generic\nunfoldings (see [3, 29] for more details).\n2.1.1 Cusp of cycles bifurcation\nThe cycle has a cusp of cycles bifurcation (CPC) if the eigenvalue µ  = µ  = 1 of Y (T ) corresponds to a two-\ndimensional Jordan block and the monodromy matrix has no other critical multipliers.

We then\napply the so-called homological equation approach [6]: the Taylor expansions of T -, 2T -, 3T - or 4T -periodic\nunknown functions involved in these parametrizations can be found by solving appropriate BVPs on [0, T ]\nso that (2) restricted to W  (Γ) has the corresponding periodic normal form. The coeﬃcients of the normal\nforms arise from the solvability conditions for the BVPs as integrals of scalar products over [0, T ], involving\nnonlinear terms of (2) near the periodic solution u , as well as the critical eigenfunctions and higher order\nexpansion terms of the center manifold. The Taylor expansion coeﬃcient functions are usually unique up to\nthe addition of a multiple of a known eigenfunction. This has to be ﬁxed by adding an integral condition.\nAmong other things this leads to the fact that normal form coeﬃcients are not unique but implications\nfor the underlying dynamical systems are independent of this. We also remark that the solvability of all\nthe equations up to the maximal order of the normal form has to be checked. Finally, we note that the\ncoeﬃcients related to the transformation of time will only be computed when needed in the computation of\nthe critical coeﬃcients in the normal form for the state variables.\nThe two-dimensional critical center manifold W  (Γ) at the CPC bifurcation can be parametrized locally by\n(τ, ξ) as\n(13)\nu = u  + ξv + H(τ, ξ), τ\n[0, T ], ξ\nR,\n∈\n∈\nwhere H satisﬁes H(T, ξ) = H(0, ξ) and has the Taylor expansion\n(14)\nH(τ, ξ) =\nh ξ  +\nh ξ  + O(ξ ),\nwhere u  and all h  are functions of τ , with h (T ) = h (0), for j = 2, 3, while the generalized eigenfunction\nv is given by\n(15)\n\n\nA(τ )v\n˙v\n−\nF (u ) = 0, τ\n−\nv(0) = 0,\nv(T )\ndτ = 0.\nv, F (u )\ni\n−\nh\nR\n[0, T ],\n∈\nThe function v exists due to Lemma 2 of [23].

So, for any value of α\nwe get an equation for h  to be solved in the space of vector-functions on [0, T ] satisfying h (T ) = h (0).\nNotice that if h  satisﬁes (23), h  + εF (u ) also satisﬁes (23), due to the fact that F (u ) is in the kernel\nA(τ ) and to the linearity of this operator.

Previous studies have suggested that NF-B activity is sup-\npressed in germinal center and lymphoma B cells that express high levels of BCL-6, and yet the reason for this is unknown. We\nreport in this study that BCL-6 can bind to three sequence motifs in the 5 regulatory region of NF-B1 in vitro and in vivo, and\nrepress NF-B1 transcription both in reporter assays and in lymphoma B cell lines. BCL-6    mice further conﬁrm the biological\nrelevance of BCL-6-dependent regulation of NF-B1 because BCL-6 inactivation caused notable increase in p105/p50 proteins in\nseveral cell types. Among these, BCL-6    macrophage cell lines displayed a hyperproliferation phenotype that can be reversed\nby NF-B inhibitors, e.g., N-tosyl- -phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and SN50, a result that is consistent with increased nuclear\nB-binding activity of p50 homodimer and p50/p65 heterodimer. Our results demonstrate that BCL-6 can negatively regulate\nNF-B1 expression, thereby inhibiting NF-B-mediated cellular functions. The Journal of Immunology, 2005, 174: 205–214.\nCL-6 is the most frequently targeted proto-oncogene in\nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL)  (1). One of the most\ncommon NHL subtypes is the diffuse large B cell lym-\nphoma (DLBCL) believed to derive from germinal center (GC) B\ncells. Nearly 50% of these tumors constitutively express BCL-6\neither as the result of chromosomal translocations or activating\nmutations, both of which enable BCL-6 transcription to bypass a\nnegative autoregulation mechanism (2, 3). Recent work also sug-\ngested a strong link between BCL-6 expression and favorable DL-\nBCL prognosis after chemotherapy (4, 5). However, the mecha-\nnism underlying BCL-6-mediated transformation remains elusive,\nlargely because information connecting BCL-6 function with the\nregulation of cell growth or apoptosis has not been forthcoming.\nBCL-6 also plays important roles in the normal immune system, as\nBCL-6    mice fail to form GC and suffer from a severe hyper-\nTh2-type inﬂammatory disease (6, 7). Because the development of\nboth T and B cells as well as the T cell-independent Ab response\nare unperturbed in these mice, the GC and Th cell defects reﬂect\nBCL-6 function at speciﬁc stages of T and B cell differentiation.\nOn the B cell side, although it is clear that the GC phenotype in the\nBCL-6 KO mice is B cell autonomous (8), little is known regard-\ning which aspects of the B cell response during GC development\nare dependent upon BCL-6.\nA number of BCL-6 target genes have been reported that include\nthe germline transcript I (9), activation markers CD69 and CD44\n(10), cell cycle regulators p27Kip1 and cyclin D2 (10), regulator of\nplasma cell differentiation Blimp-1 (10 –12), and several chemokine\ngenes (10, 13). The link between BCL-6 and Blimp-1, a master\nregulator of plasma cell differentiation, suggests that BCL-6 may\nfacilitate transformation by inhibiting differentiation of lymphoma\ncells. Nonetheless, none of these target genes provides a convincing\nexplanation for lack of GC in the BCL-6    mice. Published work on\nthe role of BCL-6 in proliferation and apoptosis is very controversial.\nAlthough overexpression of BCL-6 in CV-1 and U2OS cells was\nfound to cause cell cycle block in S phase and apoptosis (14, 15), an\nantiapoptotic role was described for BCL-6 in differentiating mouse\nmyocytes (16). Furthermore, although BCL-6 was reported to repress\np27Kip1 and cyclin D2 expression in B cells (10), its role in regulat-\ning cell proliferation has not been directly studied in depth.\nThe NF-B family of transcriptional factors plays a central role in\nimmune, inﬂammatory, and acute phase responses. They are also\nimplicated in the control of lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and\napoptosis. Mammalian NF-B is composed of dimers of ﬁve family\nmembers, namely NF-B1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-B2\n(p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), Rel (c-Rel), and RelB. In\nmost cells, the majority of the dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm\nby the inhibitory IB proteins. Nuclear translocation of NF-B occurs\nwhen extracellular stimuli activate the IB kinase (IKK) complex that\nphosphorylates the IB proteins, targeting them for destruction by the\nubiquitination/proteasome pathway (17, 18). Many signaling path-\nways implicated in B cell proliferation, including those triggered by\nLPS, anti-CD40, and anti-IgM, converge upon and require the activity\nBCL-6 REGULATES EXPRESSION OF NF-B1 p105/50\nof NF-B (19 –21). In the macrophage/osteoclast lineage, a ho-\nmodimeric cytokine, CSF-1, is the primary regulator of survival,\nproliferation, and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 22). Major events\ntriggered by engagement of the CSF-1 receptor, c-Fms, include\nactivation of STAT1, STAT3, the MAPK, and the PI3K/AKT path-\nways (23–26). Altho",

         "This paper documents a study, carried out in the academic year 2003-2004, on fifteen factors that may influence performance on a first year object-oriented programming module. The factors included prior academic experience, prior computer experience, self-perception of programming performance and comfort level on the module and specific cognitive skills. The study found that a student's perception of their understanding of the module had the strongest correlation with programming performance, r=0.76, p‹0.01. In addition, Leaving Certificate (LC) mathematics and science scores were shown to have a strong correlation with performance. A regression module, based upon a student's perception of their understanding of the module, gender, LC mathematics score and comfort level was able to account for 79% of the variance in programming performance results.",

         "Objective—The high and low responder phenomenon describes individual differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) activity. We characterized patterns of intracellular accumulation, externalization, and shedding of TF in response to LPS in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). Methods and Results—After 2 hours of LPS stimulation of whole blood, flow cytometry analyses revealed a larger population of TF-positive monocytes in HRs (32.0±3.5%) versus LRs (11.2±1.2%; P≤0.05), along with a stronger mean fluorescence intensity of TF signal in HRs (7.1±0.5 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with LRs (5.4±0.4 AU; P≤0.05). The LPS-treated blood of the HR group contained 2-fold more TF-positive microparticles than LRs. In-cell Western assay demonstrated higher intracellular accumulation of TF in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from LRs because LPS induced a 3.7-fold increase of total TF levels in LRs versus a 1.5-fold increase in HRs. In contrast, in response to LPS stimulation, MNCs from HRs exhibited a 4-fold induction of surface TF, whereas MNCs from LRs only had a minor increase in surface TF levels. Conclusions—The higher availability of surface TF antigen on MNCs from HRs and TF-containing microparticles might make these individuals more susceptible to hypercoagulation.",

         "We present an encoding framework which exploits semantics for video content delivery. The video content is organized based on the idea of main content message. In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.",

         "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

         "Abstract Laboratory natural selection and artificial selection are vital tools for addressing specific questions about evolutionary patterns of variation. Laboratory natural selection can illuminate whether a putative selective agent is capable of generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits and the extent to which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss theoretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken beyond model organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation.",

         "The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events. We recorded neurons from the basolateral complex of two monkeys while they performed visually cued schedules of sequential color discrimination trials, with both valid and random cues. When the cues were valid, the visual cue, which was present throughout each trial, indicated how many trials remained to be successfully completed before a reward. Seventy-six percent of recorded neurons showed response selectivity, with the selectivity depending on some aspects of the current schedule. After a reward, when the monkeys knew that the upcoming cue would be valid, 88 of 246 (36%) neurons responded between schedules, seemingly anticipating the receiving information about the upcoming schedule length. When the cue appeared, 102 of 246 (41%) neurons became selective, at this point encoding information about whether the current trial was the only trial required or how many more trials are needed to obtain a reward. These cue-related responses had a median latency of 120 ms (just between the latencies in inferior temporal visual area TE and perirhinal cortex). When the monkey was releasing a touch bar to complete the trial correctly, 71 of 246 (29%) neurons responded, with responses in the rewarded trials being similar no matter which schedule was ending, thus being sensitive to the reward contingency. Finally, 39 of 246 (16%) neurons responded around the reward. We suggest that basolateral amygdala, by anticipating and then delineating the schedule and representing reward contingency, provide contextual information that is important for adjusting motivational level as a function of immediate behavior goals.",

         "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation.",

         "Over the past two decades, the role of apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs has become clear. Apoptosis may occur via a death receptor‐dependent (extrinsic) or independent (intrinsic or mitochondrial) pathway. Mitochondria play a central role in cell death in response to DNA damage, and mediate the interaction(s) of various cytoplasmic organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The mitochondrial pathway of cell death is mediated by Bcl‐2 family proteins, a group of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that regulate the passage of small molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis‐inducing factor, which activates caspase cascades, through the mitochondrial transition pore. In addition, apoptosis can induce autophagic cell death via crosstalk between the two pathways upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The current review focused on recent advances surrounding the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by anticancer agents and discussed potential molecular targets for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect(s) of anticancer agents.

         "Phytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in some cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many bacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phytochrome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features of a bonafide phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the chromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXα, which is produced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore was shown to be covalently attached via its A‐ring endo‐vinyl group to a cysteine residue outside the defined bilin lyase domain of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes. Site‐directed mutagenesis identified Cys12 and His247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility, respectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red‐light‐absorbing Pr form and immediately converted into a far‐red‐light‐absorbing Pfr‐enriched form. It shows the characteristic red/far‐red‐light‐induced photoreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that lacks the C15/16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to a 15Z/15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphorylation of PaBphP was demonstrated, confirming its role as a sensor kinase of a bacterial two‐component signaling system.",

         "Two subfamilies of the polar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) located on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis, along with unknown phospholipids, were recently shown to participate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages (Villeneuve, C., G. Etienne, V. Abadie, H. Montrozier, C. Bordier, F. Laval, M. Daffe, I. Maridonneau-Parini, and C. Astarie-Dequeker. 2003. Surface-exposed glycopeptidolipids of Mycobacterium smegmatis specifically inhibit the phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages. Identification of a novel family of glycopeptidolipids. J. Biol. Chem. 278: 51291–51300). As demonstrated herein, a phospholipid mixture that derived from the methanol-insoluble fraction inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis. Inhibition was essentially attributable to phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), namely PIM2 and PIM6, because the purified phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were inactive. This was further confirmed using purified PIM2 and PIM6 from M. bovis BCG that decreased by half the internalization of M. smegmatis. Both compounds also inhibited the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium but had no effect on the internalization of zymosan used as a control particle of the phagocytic process. When coated on latex beads, PIM2 and polar GPL (GPL III) favored the particle entry through complement receptor 3. GPL III, but not PIM2, also directed particle entry through the mannose receptor. Therefore, surface-exposed mycobacterial PIM and polar GPL participate in the receptor-dependent internalization of mycobacteria in human macrophages.",

         "Insights from the developing world: thrifty genotypes and thrifty phenotypes",
         "Few researchers would dispute that the pandemic of obesity is caused by a profound mismatch between humanity's present environmental circumstances and those that have moulded evolutionary selection. This concept was first articulated when gestational diabetes was described as being the result of a ‘thrifty genotype rendered detrimental by progress’. More recently, this hypothesis has been extended to the concept of a ‘thrifty phenotype’ to describe the metabolic adaptations adopted as a survival strategy by a malnourished fetus; changes that may also be inappropriate to deal with a later life of affluence. Both the thrifty genotype and the thrifty phenotype hypotheses would predict that populations in some areas of the developing world would be at greater risk of obesity and its co-morbidities; a proposition to be explored in the present paper. To date thrifty genes remain little more than a nebulous concept propagated by the intuitive logic that man has been selected to survive episodic famine and seasonal hungry periods. Under such conditions those individuals who could lay down extra energy stores and use them most efficiently would have a survival advantage. The search for candidate thrifty genes needs to cover every aspect of human energy balance from food-seeking behaviour to the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The present paper will describe examples of attempts to find thrifty genes in three selected candidate areas: maternally-transmitted mitochondrial genes; the uncoupling proteins; apoE4, whose geographical distribution has been linked to a possible thrifty role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.",

         "BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process. First, a BXH-2–specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence–binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-γ in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.",

         "The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression (\"reverse immunology\"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in proteomics for the identification of tumor antigens. These advances are opening the door for targeted vaccine development, and for using immune response signatures as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",

         "BACKGROUND\nElevated concentrations of homocysteine in blood may be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations can be caused by decreased methylation of homocysteine to form methionine, as occurs in folate deficiency. A parallel pathway exists for methylation of homocysteine, in which choline, by way of betaine, is the methyl donor.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to determine whether choline deficiency results in a decreased capacity to methylate homocysteine.\n\n\nDESIGN\nC57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, or 35 mmol choline/kg diet for 3 wk. We then administered an oral methionine load to the animals and measured plasma homocysteine concentrations. Also, in a pilot study, we examined 8 men who were fed a diet providing 550 mg choline/d per 70 kg body weight for 10 d, followed by a diet providing almost no choline, until the subjects were clinically judged to be choline deficient or for <or=42 d. A methionine load was administered at the end of each dietary phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hours after the methionine load, choline-deficient mice had plasma homocysteine concentrations twice those of choline-fed mice. Four hours after the methionine load, clinically choline-depleted men had plasma homocysteine concentrations that were 35% greater than those in men not choline depleted.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that choline, like folate, plays an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine in humans and that response to a methionine load may be useful when assessing choline nutriture.",

To distinguish between fear relevance and time of appearance in evolutionary history, the authors compare phylogenetic and ontogenetic fear-relevant and fear-irrelevant stimuli in a visual search task. The authors found no evidence for a special role of phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli; it seems that fear relevance in general is more important than is the evolutionary age.

         "We have created a stable transgenic rag2-EGFP-mMyc zebrafish line that develops GFP-labeled T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), allowing visualization of the onset and spread of this disease. Here, we show that leukemias from this transgenic line are highly penetrant and render animals moribund by 80.7 ± 17.6 days of life (±1 SD, range = 50-158 days). These T cell leukemias are clonally aneuploid, can be transplanted into irradiated recipient fish, and express the zebrafish orthologues of the human T-ALL oncogenes tal1/scl and lmo2, thus providing an animal model for the most prevalent molecular subgroup of human T-ALL. Because T-ALL develops very rapidly in rag2-EGFP-mMyc transgenic fish (in which “mMyc” represents mouse c-Myc), this line can only be maintained by in vitro fertilization. Thus, we have created a conditional transgene in which the EGFP-mMyc oncogene is preceded by a loxed dsRED2 gene and have generated stable rag2-loxP-dsRED2-loxP-EGFP-mMyc transgenic zebrafish lines, which have red fluorescent thymocytes and do not develop leukemia. Transgenic progeny from one of these lines can be induced to develop T-ALL by injecting Cre RNA into one-cell-stage embryos, demonstrating the utility of the Cre/lox system in the zebrafish and providing an essential step in preparing this model for chemical and genetic screens designed to identify modifiers of Myc-induced T-ALL.",

         "Neurexins constitute a large family of highly variable cell-surface molecules that may function in synaptic transmission and/or synapse formation. Each of the three known neurexin genes encodes two major neurexin variants, α- and β-neurexins, that are composed of distinct extracellular domains linked to identical intracellular sequences. Deletions of one, two, or all three α-neurexins in mice recently demonstrated their essential role at synapses. In multiple α-neurexin knock-outs, neurotransmitter release from excitatory and inhibitory synapses was severely reduced, primarily probably because voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels were impaired. It remained unclear, however, which neurexin variants actually influence exocytosis and Ca2+ channels, which domain of neurexins is required for this function, and which Ca2+-channel subtypes are regulated. Here, we show by electrophysiological recordings that transgenic neurexin 1α rescues the release and Ca2+-current phenotypes, whereas transgenic neurexin 1β has no effect, indicating the importance of the extracellular sequences for the function of neurexins. Because neurexin 1α rescued the knock-out phenotype independent of the α-neurexin gene deleted, these data are consistent with a redundant function among different α-neurexins. In both knock-out and transgenically rescued mice, α-neurexins selectively affected the component of neurotransmitter release that depended on activation of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, but left L-type Ca2+ channels unscathed. Our findings indicate that α-neurexins represent organizer molecules in neurotransmission that regulate N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, constituting an essential role at synapses that critically involves the extracellular domains of neurexins.",

         "Plants that hyperaccumulate Ni exhibit an exceptional degree of Ni tolerance and the ability to translocate Ni in large amounts from root to shoot. In hyperaccumulator plants in the genus Alyssum, free His is an important Ni binding ligand that increases in the xylem proportionately to root Ni uptake. To determine the molecular basis of the His response and its contribution to Ni tolerance, transcripts representing seven of the eight enzymes involved in His biosynthesis were investigated in the hyperaccumulator species Alyssum lesbiacum by RNA gel blot analysis. None of the transcripts changed in abundance in either root or shoot tissue when plants were exposed to Ni, but transcript levels were constitutively higher in A. lesbiacum than in the congeneric nonaccumulator A. montanum, especially for the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyltransferase (ATP-PRT). Comparison with the weak hyperaccumulator A. serpyllifolium revealed a close correlation between Ni tolerance, root His concentration, and ATP-PRT transcript abundance. Overexpression of an A. lesbiacum ATP-PRT cDNA in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana increased the pool of free His up to 15-fold in shoot tissue, without affecting the concentration of any other amino acid. His-overproducing lines also displayed elevated tolerance to Ni but did not exhibit increased Ni concentrations in either xylem sap or shoot tissue, suggesting that additional factors are necessary to recapitulate the complete hyperaccumulator phenotype. These results suggest that ATP-PRT expression plays a major role in regulating the pool of free His and contributes to the exceptional Ni tolerance of hyperaccumulator Alyssum species.",

         "The stringent starvation protein A (SspA) is a RNA polymerase‐associated protein and is required for transcriptional activation of bacteriophage P1 late promoters. However, the role of SspA in gene expression in Escherichia coli is essentially unknown. In this work, we show that SspA is essential for cell survival during acid‐induced stress. Apparently, SspA inhibits stationary‐phase accumulation of H‐NS, a global regulator which functions mostly as a repressor, thereby derepressing multiple stress defence systems including those for acid stress and nutrient starvation. Consequently, the gene expression pattern of the H‐NS regulon  is  altered  in  the  sspA mutant,  leading  to acid‐sensitive and hypermotile phenotypes. Thus, our study indicates that SspA is a global regulator, which acts upstream of H‐NS, and thereby plays an important role in the stress response of E. coli during stationary phase. In addition, our results indicate that the expression of the H‐NS regulon is sensitive to small changes in the cellular level of H‐NS, enabling the cell to response rapidly to environment cues. As SspA and H‐NS are highly conserved among Gram‐negative bacteria, of which many are pathogenic, the global role of SspA in the stress response and pathogenesis is discussed.",

         "All germ cells throughout the animal kingdom contain cytoplasmic cloud-like accumulations of material called nuage. Polar bodies in Drosophila oocytes are probably the best known forms of nuage. In spermatogenic cells, the nuage is called chromatoid body (CB). In early spermatids of the rat, it has a diameter of 1-1.5 microm and a finely filamentous lobular structure. Typically, it is associated with a multitude of vesicles. It is first clearly seen in mid- and late pachytene spermatocytes as an intermitochondrial dense material. During early spermiogenesis it is seen near the Golgi complex and frequently connected by material continuities through nuclear pore complexes with intranuclear particles. In living cells, the CB moves around the Golgi complex and has frequent contacts with it. The CB also moves perpendicularly to the nuclear envelope, and even through cytoplasmic bridges to the neighbour spermatids. One of the major components of the CB is a DEAD-box RNA helicase VASA that belongs to a class of proteins thought to act as RNA chaperones. It is a general marker of all germ cells and best characterized in Drosophila. The mouse VASA homologue was recently used as a marker of sperm formation from embryonic stem cells. It becomes generally accepted that the CB with its associated structures constitute a mechanism of post-transcriptional processing and storage of several mRNA species that are shared between neighbour cells and used for translation when the genome of the spermatids becomes inactive.",

         "The increasing photorealism for computer graphics has made computer graphics a convincing form of image forgery. Therefore, classifying photographic images and photorealistic computer graphics has become an important problem for image forgery detection. In this paper, we propose a new geometry-based image model, motivated by the physical image generation process, to tackle the above-mentioned problem. The proposed model reveals certain physical differences between the two image categories, such as the gamma correction in photographic images and the sharp structures in computer graphics. For the problem of image forgery detection, we propose two levels of image authenticity definition, i.e., imaging-process authenticity and scene authenticity, and analyze our technique against these definitions. Such definition is important for making the concept of image authenticity computable. Apart from offering physical insights, our technique with a classification accuracy of 83.5% outperforms those in the prior work, i.e., wavelet features at 80.3% and cartoon features at 71.0%. We also consider a recapturing attack scenario and propose a counter-attack measure. In addition, we constructed a publicly available benchmark dataset with images of diverse content and computer graphics of high photorealism.",

         "SUMMARY We have explored the molecular basis for differences in physiological function between the gills and opercular epithelium of the euryhaline killifish Fundulus heteroclitus. These tissues are functionally similar in seawater, but in freshwater the gills actively absorb Na+ but not Cl–, whereas the opercular epithelium actively absorbs Cl– but not Na+. These differences in freshwater physiology are likely due to differences in absolute levels of gene expression (measured using real-time PCR), as several proteins important for Na+ transport, namely Na+,H+-exchanger 2 (NHE2), carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2), Na+,HCO3–cotransporter 1, and V-type H+-ATPase, were expressed at 3- to over 30-fold higher absolute levels in the gills. In gills, transfer from 10% seawater to freshwater increased the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase by twofold (from 12 h to 7 days), increased the expression of NHE2 (at 12 h) and CA2 (from 12 h to 7 days), and decreased the expression of NHE3 (from 12 h to 3 days). In opercular epithelium, NHE2 was not expressed; furthermore, Na+,K+-ATPase activity was unchanged after transfer to freshwater, CA2 mRNA levels decreased, and NHE3 levels increased. Consistent with their functional similarities in seawater, killifish gills and opercular epithelium expressed Na+,K+-ATPase α1a, Na+,K+,2Cl–cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl– channel and the signalling protein 14-3-3a at similar absolute levels. Furthermore, NKCC1 and CFTR were suppressed equally in each tissue after freshwater transfer, and 14-3-3a mRNA increased in both. These results provide insight into the mechanisms of ion transport by killifish gills and opercular epithelia, and demonstrate a potential molecular basis for the differences in physiological function between these two organs.",

         "Human organic anion transporter 2 (hOat2 [SLC22A7]) is highly expressed in the human liver. Although localization, gene expression, substrate specificity and transport mechanisms of other human Oat isoforms such as human Oat1 (hOat1), human Oat3 (hOat3) and human Oat4 (hOat4) have been elucidated, information concerning human Oat2 (hOat2) is less defined. The objective of this study was to provide further information on the transport mechanism and substrate specificity of hOat2. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the transport of organic compounds mediated by hOat2 was not affected by the replacement of extracellular sodium with lithium, choline and mannitol. The uptake of estrone sulfate (ES) in hOat2‐expressing oocytes was significantly trans‐stimulated by preloading the oocytes with fumarate and succinate, but not glutarate. Moreover, we observed that hOat2 mediates the transport of bumetanide, ES, glutarate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, allopurinol, prostaglandin E2, 5‐fluorouracil, paclitaxel and L‐ascorbic acid. These compounds are identified for the first time as hOat2 substrates. A wide range of structurally unrelated organic compounds inhibited the hOat2‐mediated uptake of tetracycline, except for sulfobromophthalein. All of these findings indicate that hOat2 is a sodium‐independent multi‐specific organic anion/dimethyldicarboxylate exchanger. Our present findings thus provide further insights into the role of hOat2 in hepatic drug transport.",

In the current study, we characterize structural features of FANCD2 required for this intranuclear translocation. We have previously identified 2 normal mRNA splice variants of FANCD2, one containing exon 44 sequence at the 3' end (FANCD2-44) and one containing exon 43 sequence (FANCD2-43). The 2 predicted FANCD2 proteins differ in their carboxy terminal 24 amino acids. In stably transfected FANCD2(-/-) fibroblasts, FANCD2-44 and FANCD2-43 proteins were monoubiquitinated on K561. Only FANCD2-44 corrected the mitomycin C (MMC) sensitivity of the transfected cells. We find that monoubiquitinated FANCD2-44 was translocated from the soluble nuclear compartment into chromatin. A mutant form of FANCD2-44 (FANCD2-K561R) was not monoubiquitinated and failed to bind chromatin. A truncated FANCD2 protein (Exon44-T), lacking the carboxy terminal 24 amino acids encoded by exon 44 but retaining K561, and another mutant FANCD2 protein, with a single amino acid substitution at a conserved residue within the C-terminal 24 amino acids (D1428A), were monoubiquitinated. Both mutants were targeted to chromatin but failed to correct MMC sensitivity. Taken together, our results indicate that monoubiquitination of FANCD2 regulates chromatin binding and that D1428 within the carboxy terminal acidic sequence encoded by exon 44 is independently required for functional complementation of FA-D2 cells. We hypothesize that the carboxy terminus of FANCD2-44 plays a critical role in sensing or repairing DNA damage.",

         "Coltman and Slate (2003) recently performed a meta-analysis on studies that investigated the association between genetic variation at microsatellite loci and phenotypic trait variation. One factor not explicitly addressed in their meta-analysis is the actual estimation of genome-wide heterozygosity via molecular markers. Many authors still associate marker-estimated heterozygosity with genome-wide heterozygosity, despite allozyme-based evidence that such correlations are usually very weak or nonexistent. Here, we show that genome-wide heterozygosity is poorly estimated not only by allozymes but also by microsatellite loci and by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thus, associations between fitness (or other phenotypes) and heterozygosity should be established firmly on causative factors and not on simple correlations.",

For surfaces with varying material properties, a full segmentation into different material types is also computed. It is assumed that the camera viewpoint is fixed, but the illumination varies over the input sequence. It is also assumed that one or more example objects with similar materials and known geometry are imaged under the same illumination conditions. Unlike most previous work in shape reconstruction, this technique can handle objects with arbitrary and spatially-varying BRDFs. Furthermore, the approach works for arbitrary distant and unknown lighting environments. Finally, almost no calibration is needed, making the approach exceptionally simple to apply.",

         "Tip growth in neuronal cells, plant cells, and fungal hyphae is known to require tip-localized Rho GTPase, calcium, and filamentous actin (F-actin), but how they interact with each other is unclear. The pollen tube is an exciting model to study spatiotemporal regulation of tip growth and F-actin dynamics. An Arabidopsis thaliana Rho family GTPase, ROP1, controls pollen tube growth by regulating apical F-actin dynamics. This paper shows that ROP1 activates two counteracting pathways involving the direct targets of tip-localized ROP1: RIC3 and RIC4. RIC4 promotes F-actin assembly, whereas RIC3 activates Ca2+ signaling that leads to F-actin disassembly. Overproduction or depletion of either RIC4 or RIC3 causes tip growth defects that are rescued by overproduction or depletion of RIC3 or RIC4, respectively. Thus, ROP1 controls actin dynamics and tip growth through a check and balance between the two pathways. The dual and antagonistic roles of this GTPase may provide a unifying mechanism by which Rho modulates various processes dependent on actin dynamics in eukaryotic cells.",

         "Purpose: Cutaneous melanoma is a common, aggressive cancer with increasing incidence. The identification of melanoma-specific deregulated genes could provide molecular markers for lymph node staging assays and further insight into melanoma tumorigenesis. Experimental Design: Total RNA isolated from 45 primary melanoma, 18 benign skin nevi, and 7 normal skin tissue specimens were analyzed on an Affymetrix Hu133A microarray containing 22,000 probe sets. Results: Hierarchical clustering revealed a distinct separation of the melanoma samples from the benign and normal specimens. Novel genes associated with malignant melanoma were identified. Differential gene expression of two melanoma-specific genes, PLAB and L1CAM, were tested by a one-step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay on primary malignant melanoma, benign nevi, and normal skin samples, as well as on malignant melanoma lymph node metastasis and melanoma-free lymph nodes. The performance of the markers was compared with conventional melanoma markers such as tyrosinase, gp100, and MART1. Conclusion: Our study systematically identified novel melanoma-specific genes and showed the feasibility of using a combination of PLAB and L1CAM in a reverse transcription-PCR assay to differentiate clinically relevant samples containing benign or malignant melanocytes.",

         "Growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are highly up-regulated during development and following renal injury and are known to induce marked morphogenic actions in cultured tubular epithelial cells, including scattering, migration, single cell branching morphogenesis, and multicellular branching tubulogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that HGF stimulates epithelial cells to express neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal), a member of the lipocalin family of secreted proteins that has recently been shown to participate in mesenchymal-epithelial transformation via its ability to augment cellular iron uptake. At concentrations below those found to mediate iron transport, purified Ngal can induce a promigratory and probranching effect that is dependent on ERK activation. The suppression of Ngal expression using short hairpin RNA results in increased cyst formation by tubular cells. However, the simultaneous addition of Ngal and HGF leads to direct association of the two proteins, and results in a partial inhibition of HGF-mediated activation of c-Met and the downstream MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways. This inhibitory effect down-regulates HGF-stimulated single cell migration, and limits branching morphogenesis at both the single cell and multicellular level. These experiments demonstrate that the local expression of Ngal can play a regulatory role in epithelial morphogenesis by promoting the organization of cells into tubular structures while simultaneously negatively modulating the branching effects of HGF.",

         "Sulforaphane, a constituent of many edible cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, effectively suppresses proliferation of cancer cells in culture and in vivo by causing apoptosis induction, but the sequence of events leading to cell death is poorly defined. Here, we show that multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak play a critical role in apoptosis induction by sulforaphane. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (a) sulforaphane treatment caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the protein levels of both Bax and Bak and conformational change and mitochondrial translocation of Bax in SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from wild-type mice to trigger cytosolic release of apoptogenic molecules (cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and ultimately cell death; (b) MEFs derived from Bax or Bak knockout mice resisted cell death by sulforaphane, and (c) MEFs derived from Bax and Bak double knockout mice exhibited even greater protection against sulforaphane-induced cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis compared with wild-type or single knockout cells. Interestingly, sulforaphane treatment also caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the protein level of Apaf-1 in wild-type, Bax-/-, and Bak-/- MEFs but not in double knockout, suggesting that Bax and Bak might regulate sulforaphane-mediated induction of Apaf-1 protein. A marked decline in the protein level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis on treatment with sulforaphane was also observed. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that sulforaphane-induced apoptosis is amplified by a decrease in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis level, which functions to block cell death by inhibiting activities of caspases. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that Bax and Bak proteins play a critical role in initiation of cell death by sulforaphane.",

Although regarded as a member of the carbonic anhydrase gene family, the encoded protein (CAR8) has no reported enzymatic activity. In normal mice, CAR8 is abundantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells as well as in several other cell groups. Compatible with nonsense-mediated decay of mutant transcripts, CAR8 is virtually absent in mice homozygous for the wdl mutation. These data indicate that the wdl mouse is a Car8 null mutant and that CAR8 plays a central role in motor control.",

         "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. In virtually all SMA patients, a nearly identical copy gene is present, SMN2. SMN2 cannot fully compensate for the loss of SMN1 because the majority of transcripts derived from SMN2 lack a critical exon (exon 7), resulting in a dysfunctional SMN protein. Therefore, the critical distinction between a functional and a dysfunctional SMN protein is the inclusion or the exclusion of the exon 7 encoded peptide. To determine the role of the 16 amino acids encoded by SMN exon 7, a panel of synthetic mutations were transiently expressed in SMA patient fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Consistent with previous reports, the protein encoded by SMN exons 1-6 was primarily restricted to the nucleus. However, a variety of heterologous sequences fused to the C-terminus of SMN exons 1-6 allowed mutant SMN proteins to properly distribute to the cytoplasm and to the nuclear gems. These data demonstrate that the SMN exon 7 sequence is not specifically required, rather this region functions as a non-specific 'tail' that facilitates proper localization. Therefore, a possible means to restore additional activity to the SMNDelta7 protein could be to induce a longer C-terminus by suppressing recognition of the native stop codon. To address this possibility, aminoglycosides were examined for their ability to restore detectable levels of SMN protein in SMA patient fibroblasts. Aminoglycosides can suppress the accurate identification of translation termination codons in eukaryotic cells. Consistent with this, treatment of SMA patient fibroblasts with tobramycin and amikacin resulted in a quantitative increase in SMN-positive gems and an overall increase in detectable SMN protein. Taken together, this work describes the role of the critical exon 7 region and identifies a possible alternative approach for therapeutic intervention.",

         "Normal human melanocyte homeostasis as a paradigm for understanding melanoma.",
         "Melanocytes, after cell division, separate and migrate along the basement membrane; they extend their dendrites and establish multiple contacts with keratinocytes. Once adhesion is established, keratinocytes control melanocyte growth and expression of cell surface receptors. Most melanomas arise within the epidermis (melanoma in situ) and then invade across the basement membrane. These melanoma cells escape from control by keratinocytes through five major mechanisms: (1) downregulation of receptors important for communication with keratinocytes such as E-cadherin, P-cadherin, and desmoglein, which is achieved through growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and endothelin-1 produced by fibroblasts or keratinocytes; (2) upregulation of receptors and signaling molecules important for melanoma cell-melanoma cell and melanoma cell-fibroblast interactions such as N-cadherin, Mel-CAM, and zonula occludens protein-1; (3) deregulation of morphogens such as Notch receptors and their ligands; (4) loss of anchorage to the basement membrane because of an altered expression of cell-matrix adhesion molecules; (5) increased elaboration of metal-loproteinases. Thus, investigating normal melanocyte homeostasis helps us to better define how melanoma cells escape the microenvironment created by epidermal keratinocytes and how they develop new cellular partners in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which support their growth and invasion.",

Microglia, the immunocompetent cells of the brain, contribute significantly to the tumor and are potential interaction partners of the glioma cells. We studied the impact of the presence of microglia on tumor cell invasion in cultured brain slices. To selectively deplete microglia, the slices were treated with clodronate-filled liposomes. When glioma cells were injected into slices devoid of endogenous microglia, the invasiveness of the tumors was significantly decreased as compared with controls. Inoculation of exogenous microglia together with glioma cells into cultured brain slices increased the infiltrative behavior of the tumor depending on the microglia/glioma cell ratio. Cell culture experiments revealed that soluble factors released from glioma cells strongly stimulate metalloprotease-2 activity in microglia. In the brain slices inoculated with glioma cells, increased activity of metalloprotease-2 was directly correlated with the abundance of microglia. Our data indicate that glioma cells stimulate microglial cells to increase breakdown of extracellular matrix and thereby promote tumor invasiveness.",

         "Cryptochromes (CRY) are blue light photoreceptors that mediate various light-induced responses in plants and animals. Arabidopsis CRY (CRY1 and CRY2) functions through negatively regulating constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) 1, a repressor of photomorphogenesis. Water evaporation and photosynthesis are regulated by the stomatal pores in plants, which are closed in darkness but open in response to blue light. There is evidence only for the phototropin blue light receptors (PHOT1 and PHOT2) in mediating blue light regulation of stomatal opening. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized role for Arabidopsis CRY and COP1 in the regulation of stomatal opening. Stomata of the cry1 cry2 double mutant showed reduced blue light response, whereas those of the CRY1-overexpressing plants showed hypersensitive response to blue light. In addition, stomata of the phot1 phot2 double mutant responded to blue light, but those of the cry1 cry2 phot1 phot2 quadruple mutant hardly responded. Strikingly, stomata of the cop1 mutant were constitutively open in darkness and stomata of the cry1 cry2 cop1 and phot1 phot2 cop1 triple mutants were open as wide as those of the cop1 single mutant under blue light. These results indicate that CRY functions additively with PHOT in mediating blue light-induced stomatal opening and that COP1 is a repressor of stomatal opening and likely acts downstream of CRY and PHOT signaling pathways.",

         "We previously reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165 inflammatory effect is mediated by acute platelet-activating factor synthesis from endothelial cells upon the activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and its coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In addition, VEGF-A165 promotes the release of other endothelial mediators including nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI2). However, it is unknown whether VEGF-A165 is mediating PGI2 synthesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and/or VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation and whether the coreceptor NRP-1 potentiates VEGF-A165 activity. In this study, PGI2 synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was assessed by quantifying its stable metabolite (6-keto prostaglandin F1α, 6-keto PGF1α) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment of BAEC with VEGF analogs, VEGF-A165 (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 agonist) and VEGF-A121 (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonist) (up to 10–9 m), increased PGI2 synthesis by 70- and 40-fold within 15 min. Treatment with VEGFR-1 (placental growth factor and VEGF-B) or VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C) agonist did not increase PGI2 synthesis. The combination of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonists did not increase PGI2 release. Pretreatment with a VEGFR-2 inhibitor abrogated PGI2 release mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121, and pretreatment of BAEC with antisense oligomers targeting VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 mRNA reduced PGI2 synthesis mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121 up to 79%. In summary, our data demonstrate that the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 heterodimer (VEGFR-1/R-2) is essential for PGI2 synthesis mediated by VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121, which cannot be reproduced by the parallel activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 homodimers with corresponding agonists. In addition, the binding of VEGF-A165 to NRP-1 potentiates its capacity to promote PGI2 synthesis.",

         "ABSTRACT The 51 human adenovirus serotypes are divided into six species (A to F). Adenovirus serotypes from all species except species B utilize the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor for attachment to host cells in vitro. Species B adenoviruses primarily cause ocular and respiratory tract infections, but certain serotypes are also associated with renal disease. We have previously demonstrated that adenovirus type 11 (species B) uses CD46 (membrane cofactor protein) as a cellular receptor instead of the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (A. Segerman et al., J. Virol. 77:9183-9191, 2003). In the present study, we found that transfection with human CD46 cDNA rendered poorly permissive Chinese hamster ovary cells more permissive to infection by all species B adenovirus serotypes except adenovirus types 3 and 7. Moreover, rabbit antiserum against human CD46 blocked or efficiently inhibited all species B serotypes except adenovirus types 3 and 7 from infecting human A549 cells. We also sequenced the gene encoding the fiber protein of adenovirus type 50 (species B) and compared it with the corresponding amino acid sequences from selected serotypes, including all other serotypes of species B. From the results obtained, we conclude that CD46 is a major cellular receptor on A549 cells for all species B adenoviruses except types 3 and 7.",

         "Drosophila Wingless (Wg) is the founding member of the Wnt family of secreted proteins. During the wing development, Wg acts as a morphogen whose concentration gradient provides positional cues for wing patterning. The molecular mechanism(s) of Wg gradient formation is not fully understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the roles of glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein (Dlp), the Wg receptors Frizzled (Fz) and Fz2, and the Wg co-receptor Arrow (Arr) in Wg gradient formation in the wing disc. We demonstrate that both Dally and Dlp are essential and have different roles in Wg gradient formation. The specificities of Dally and Dlp in Wg gradient formation are at least partially achieved by their distinct expression patterns. To our surprise, although Fz2 was suggested to play an essential role in Wg gradient formation by ectopic expression studies, removal of Fz2 activity does not alter the extracellular Wg gradient. Interestingly, removal of both Fz and Fz2, or Arr causes enhanced extracellular Wg levels, which is mainly resulted from upregulated Dlp levels. We further show that Notum, a negative regulator of Wg signaling, downregulates Wg signaling mainly by modifying Dally. Last, we demonstrate that Wg movement is impeded by cells mutant for both dally and dlp. Together, these new findings suggest that the Wg morphogen gradient in the wing disc is mainly controlled by combined actions of Dally and Dlp. We propose that Wg establishes its concentration gradient by a restricted diffusion mechanism involving Dally and Dlp in the wing disc.",

         "Ozone (O3), a major photochemical oxidant, induces leaf injury concomitant with salicylic acid (SA) synthesis. In pathogen-infected leaves, SA is synthesized via two pathways, involving phenylalanine or isochorismate. SA biosynthesis under O3 fumigation is not well understood. When we applied 14C-labeled benzoic acid (a precursor of SA in the pathway via phenylalanine) to O3-exposed tobacco leaves, it was effectively metabolized to SA. However, the activity and mRNA level of isochorismate synthase (ICS) were not increased. In contrast, ICS activity was increased in O3-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana L. These results suggest that SA is synthesized via benzoic acid from phenylalanine in O3-exposed tobacco leaves but via isochorismate in Arabidopsis. Ethylene is a plant hormone that promotes leaf damage in O3-exposed plants. During O3 exposure, transgenic plants with a phenotype of reduced O3-induced ethylene production accumulated less SA than did wild-type plants. O3 increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and the transcript levels of the chorismate mutase (CM) and PAL genes in wild-type tobacco, but their induction was suppressed in the transgenic plants. These results indicate that ethylene promotes SA accumulation by regulating the expression of the CM and PAL genes in O3-exposed tobacco.",

         "Purpose: Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, the growth regulatory mechanisms of which are unknown. We investigated the involvement of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals in synovial sarcoma and evaluated the therapeutic effect of inhibiting the FGF signal. Experimental Design: The expression of 22 FGF and 4 FGF receptor (FGFR) genes in 18 primary tumors and five cell lines of synovial sarcoma were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Effects of recombinant FGF2, FGF8, and FGF18 for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the growth of synovial sarcoma cell lines were analyzed. Growth inhibitory effects of FGFR inhibitors on synovial sarcoma cell lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results: Synovial sarcoma cell lines expressed multiple FGF genes especially those expressed in neural tissues, among which FGF8 showed growth stimulatory effects in all synovial sarcoma cell lines. FGF signals in synovial sarcoma induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38MAPK but not c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Disruption of the FGF signaling pathway in synovial sarcoma by specific inhibitors of FGFR caused cell cycle arrest leading to significant growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition by the FGFR inhibitor was associated with a down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 but not p38MAPK, and an ERK kinase inhibitor also showed growth inhibitory effects for synovial sarcoma, indicating that the growth stimulatory effect of FGF was transmitted through the ERK1/2. Conclusions: FGF signals have an important role in the growth of synovial sarcoma, and inhibitory molecules will be of potential use for molecular target therapy in synovial sarcoma.",

Simulations show that the new schedules offer better performance/complexity tradeoffs, especially when the maximum number of iterations has to remain small.",

         "This study was designed to investigate the effects of the aqueous ethanol extract of Astragalus membranaceus BUNGE (Leguminosae) on rat thoracic aorta. Isometric tension was recorded in response to drugs in organ bath. In endothelium-intact aortic rings, A. membranaceus extract induced a significant dose-dependent relaxation of the rings precontracted by phenylephrine, which could be inhibited by preincubation with L-N(omega)-nitro-arginine methyl ester or methylthioninium chloride. In endothelium-denuded ones, the extract could dose-dependently relax the rings contracted by phenylephrine, not by KCl; and it could also attenuate contractile response to phenylephrine, not to caffeine or phorbol-12,13-diacetate in Ca(2+)-free medium; but it failed to affect the CaCl(2)-induced enhancement of contractile response to phenylephrine in Ca(2+)-free medium. These results indicate that nitric oxide signaling and Ca(2+)-handling pathway are involved in the A. membranaceus extract-induced vasodilatation.",

         "In this report, we use zebrafish as a model system to understand the importance of CD146 in vascular development. Endothelial‐specific expression of CD146 was verified by whole‐mount in situ hybridization. Suppression of CD146 protein expression by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) resulted in poorly developed intersomitic vessels (ISVs). In CD146 morphants, we observed a lack of blood flow through the ISV region, despite that fluorescence microangiography showed that the ISVs were present. This finding suggests that the lumens of the developing ISVs may be too narrow for proper circulation. Additionally, remodeling of the caudal vein plexus into functional vascular tubes appeared to be affected. Suppression of CD146 protein expression resulted in a circulation shunt that caused the circulation to by‐pass part of the caudal artery/vein system. The same vascular defects were recapitulated by using a second morpholino oligonucleotide. This morphant expressed a truncated CD146 protein with amino acids V32 to T57 at the N terminus deleted in an in‐frame manner. This region, therefore, is likely to contain elements critical for CD146 function. This study provides the first in vivo functional assessment of CD146 in embryonic development by showing that knockdown of CD146 protein expression severely hinders vascular development in zebrafish.

         "Cardiac troponin I is a phosphorylation target for endothelin-activated protein kinase C. Earlier work in cardiac myocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I provided evidence that protein kinase C-mediated cardiac troponin I phosphorylation accelerates relaxation. However, replacement with the slow skeletal isoform also alters the myofilament pH response and the Ca2+ transient, which could influence endothelin-mediated relaxation. Here, differences in the Ca2+ transient could not explain the divergent relaxation response to endothelin in myocytes expressing cardiac versus slow skeletal troponin I nor could activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Three separate clusters within cardiac troponin I are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and we set out to determine the contribution of the Thr144 and Ser23/Ser24 clusters to the endothelin-mediated contractile response. Myocyte replacement with a cardiac troponin I containing a Thr144 substituted with the Pro residue found in slow skeletal troponin I resulted in prolonged relaxation in response to acute endothelin compared with control myocytes. Ser23/Ser24 also is a target for protein kinase C phosphorylation of purified cardiac troponin I, and although this cluster was not acutely phosphorylated in intact myocytes, significant phosphorylation developed within 1 h after adding endothelin. Replacement of Ser23/Ser24 with Ala indicated that this cluster contributes significantly to relaxation during more prolonged endothelin stimulation. Overall, results with these mutants provide evidence that Thr144 plays an important role in the acute acceleration of relaxation, whereas Ser23/Ser24 contributes to relaxation during more prolonged activation of protein kinase C by endothelin.",

         "This paper documents a study, carried out in the academic year 2003-2004, on fifteen factors that may influence performance on a first year object-oriented programming module. The factors included prior academic experience, prior computer experience, self-perception of programming performance and comfort level on the module and specific cognitive skills. The study found that a student's perception of their understanding of the module had the strongest correlation with programming performance, r=0.76, p‹0.01. In addition, Leaving Certificate (LC) mathematics and science scores were shown to have a strong correlation with performance. A regression module, based upon a student's perception of their understanding of the module, gender, LC mathematics score and comfort level was able to account for 79% of the variance in programming performance results.",

         "Objective—The high and low responder phenomenon describes individual differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) activity. We characterized patterns of intracellular accumulation, externalization, and shedding of TF in response to LPS in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). Methods and Results—After 2 hours of LPS stimulation of whole blood, flow cytometry analyses revealed a larger population of TF-positive monocytes in HRs (32.0±3.5%) versus LRs (11.2±1.2%; P≤0.05), along with a stronger mean fluorescence intensity of TF signal in HRs (7.1±0.5 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with LRs (5.4±0.4 AU; P≤0.05). The LPS-treated blood of the HR group contained 2-fold more TF-positive microparticles than LRs. In-cell Western assay demonstrated higher intracellular accumulation of TF in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from LRs because LPS induced a 3.7-fold increase of total TF levels in LRs versus a 1.5-fold increase in HRs. In contrast, in response to LPS stimulation, MNCs from HRs exhibited a 4-fold induction of surface TF, whereas MNCs from LRs only had a minor increase in surface TF levels. Conclusions—The higher availability of surface TF antigen on MNCs from HRs and TF-containing microparticles might make these individuals more susceptible to hypercoagulation.",

         "Cbl proteins have been implicated in ligand-induced TCR/CD3 down-modulation, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed the effect of mutation of a cbl-binding site on ZAP-70 (ZAP-Y292F) on dynamics, internalization, and degradation of the TCR/CD3 complex in response to distinct stimuli. Naive CD8 T cells expressing the P14 transgenic TCR from ZAP-Y292F mice were selectively affected in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to antigenic stimulation, whereas neither anti-CD3 Ab-, and PMA-induced TCR down-modulation, nor constitutive receptor endocytosis/cycling were impaired. We further established that the defect in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to Ag was paralleled by an impaired TCR/CD3 internalization and CD3ζ degradation. Analysis of T/APC conjugates revealed that delayed redistribution of TCR at the T/APC contact zone was paralleled by a delay in TCR internalization in the synaptic zone in ZAP-Y292F compared with ZAP-wild-type T cells. Cbl recruitment to the synapse was also retarded in ZAP-Y292F T cells, although F-actin and LFA-1 redistribution was similar for both cell types. This study identifies a step involving ZAP-70/cbl interaction that is critical for rapid internalization of the TCR/CD3 complex at the CD8 T cell/APC synapse.",

         "In this work we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn the CPU time-slice utilization behavior of known programs in a Linux system. Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The \"Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis\" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C'4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution. We find our result interesting in the context that generally operating systems presently never make use of a program's previous execution history in their scheduling behavior.",

Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a new member of the NLRR family, NLRR4, and its potential role in long-lasting memory. We generated NLRR4-deficient (NLRR4−/−) mice and found that they showed impaired memory retention. In hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, NLRR4−/− mice were able to learn and maintain the memories for one day but unable to retain the memories for four days after learning. In contrast, in a hippocampus-independent task, NLRR4−/− mice were able to retain the memory normally for at least seven days. These results suggest that NLRR4 plays a key role in hippocampus-dependent long-lasting memory.",

In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.",

         "ABSTRACT Of the nasopharyngeal cultures recovered from 942 day care center (DCC) attendees in Lisbon, Portugal, 591 (62%) yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae during a surveillance performed in February and March of 1999. Forty percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. In particular, 2% were penicillin resistant and 20% had intermediate penicillin resistance. Multidrug resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracycline was the most frequent antibiotype (17% of all isolates). Serotyping and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were performed for 202 out of 237 drug-resistant pneumococci (DRPn). The most frequent serotypes were 6B (26%), 14 (22%), 19F (16%), 23F (10%), and nontypeable (12%). The majority (67%) of the DRPn strains were representatives of nine international clones included in the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network; eight of them had been detected in previous studies. Fourteen novel clones were identified, corresponding to 26% of the DRPn strains. The remaining 7% of the strains were local clones detected in our previous studies. Comparison with studies conducted since 1996 in Portuguese DCCs identified several trends: (i) the rate of DRPn frequency has fluctuated between 40 and 50%; (ii) the serotypes most frequently recovered have remained the same; (iii) nontypeable strains appear to be increasing in frequency; and (iv) a clone of serotype 33F emerged in 1999. Together, our observations highlight that the nasopharynxes of children in DCCs are a melting pot of successful DRPn clones that are important to study and monitor if we aim to gain a better understanding on the epidemiology of this pathogen.",

         "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

Polymorphism in the glutathione S-transferase GSTT1 gene has been associated with CRC risk in some but not all studies. In this study, we examined associations between GSTT1 genotypes and CRC risk, and prognosis in 361 cases and 881 unrelated controls. GSTT1 null was associated with a small but significant increase in risk (P = 0.0006, odds ratio (OR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-2.24). GSTT1 null was also associated with a significantly younger age at diagnosis (mean 65.2 years) compared with GSTT1 A (mean 67.6 years, P = 0.031). There were no significant associations between GSTT1 genotypes and clinical factors (e.g. Dukes stage, differentiation and tumour node metastasis classification) in the total case group. However, following stratification by age (<70 versus > or =70 years at diagnosis), in the patients diagnosed <70 years of age, GSTT1 null was more common in Dukes grade A/B tumours (P = 0.046), stage T1/T2 tumours (P = 0.053) and those with a pushing margin (P = 0.066). We also identified associations between GSTT1 null and increased prevalence of host lymphocyte response, particularly in the younger patients (P = 0.036). Furthermore, GSTT1 null was associated with improved survival in younger patients (P = 0.017, hazards ratio (HR) = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.31-0.89) but poorer survival in older patients (P = 0.017, HR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.12-3.20). We proposed a model based on the dual functionality of GSTT1 to explain these contrasting results. We suggest that the null genotype is associated with improved immune response in younger patients, but poorer detoxification in older patients. These findings may also provide an explanation for the contrasting finding of other studies on the role of this gene in CRC.",

         "The N‐terminus of B96Bom, a Bombyx mori G‐protein‐coupled receptor, is N‐myristoylated and translocated across the membrane",
         "In eukaryotic cellular proteins, protein N‐myristoylation has been recognized as a protein modification that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic proteins. In this study, to search for a eukaryotic N‐myristoylated transmembrane protein, the susceptibility of the N‐terminus of several G‐protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) to protein N‐myristoylation was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling. It was found that the N‐terminal 10 residues of B96Bom, a Bombyx mori GPCR, efficiently directed the protein N‐myristoylation. Analysis of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) fusion protein with the N‐terminal 90 residues of B96Bom at its N‐terminus revealed that (a) transmembrane domain 1 of B96Bom functioned as a type I signal anchor sequence, (b) the N‐myristoylated N‐terminal domain (58 residues) was translocated across the membrane, and (c) two N‐glycosylation motifs located in this domain were efficiently N‐glycosylated. In addition, when Ala4 in the N‐myristoylation motif of B96Bom90‐TNF, Met‐Gly‐Gln‐Ala‐Ala‐Thr(1–6), was replaced with Asn to generate a new N‐glycosylation motif, Asn‐Ala‐Thr(4–6), efficient N‐glycosylation was observed on this newly introduced N‐glycosylation site in the expressed protein. These results indicate that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of B96Bom is translocated across the membrane and exposed to the extracellular surface. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a eukaryotic transmembrane protein can be N‐myristoylated and that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of the protein can be translocated across the membrane.",

         "Tissue remodelling is dependent on the integration of signals that control turnover of ECM (extracellular matrix). Breakdown and endocytosis of collagen, a major component of the ECM, is central to this process. Whereas controlled secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes (such as matrix metalloproteinases) has long been known to mediate ECM breakdown, it is becoming clear that uPARAP/Endo180 (where uPARAP stands for urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein) serves as a receptor that mediates endocytosis of collagen by several types of cells. In the liver, the stellate cells play a major role in turnover of ECM including collagens. These cells synthesize various collagens and also produce matrix metalloproteinases. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of rat hepatic stellate cells to endocytose and degrade 125I-labelled heat-denatured collagen I. It was found that the collagen is efficiently taken up and degraded by these cells. Degradation was inhibited by inhibitors of lysosomal proteases (leupeptin and E-64d) and the vacuolar proton pump (concanamycin A), indicating that it takes place in lysosomes. Furthermore, endocytosed FITC-labelled collagen was shown to reach late endocytic compartments in which it colocalized with LysoTracker (a marker of late endocytic compartments). Competition experiments showed that uPA and unlabelled collagen are capable of inhibiting binding and uptake of [125I]collagen in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Western-blot analysis of cell lysate (using a polyclonal rabbit human-Endo180 antiserum) revealed a single band at 180 kDa. In addition, the antiserum was capable of reducing [125I]collagen binding to the cell surface. Finally, using two primers designed from the human uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA sequence, the expression of uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR. These results together suggest that uPARAP/Endo180 mediates endocytosis of collagen in rat liver stellate cells.",

         "Abstract Laboratory natural selection and artificial selection are vital tools for addressing specific questions about evolutionary patterns of variation. Laboratory natural selection can illuminate whether a putative selective agent is capable of generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits and the extent to which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss theoretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken beyond model organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation.",

         "The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events. We recorded neurons from the basolateral complex of two monkeys while they performed visually cued schedules of sequential color discrimination trials, with both valid and random cues. When the cues were valid, the visual cue, which was present throughout each trial, indicated how many trials remained to be successfully completed before a reward. Seventy-six percent of recorded neurons showed response selectivity, with the selectivity depending on some aspects of the current schedule. After a reward, when the monkeys knew that the upcoming cue would be valid, 88 of 246 (36%) neurons responded between schedules, seemingly anticipating the receiving information about the upcoming schedule length. When the cue appeared, 102 of 246 (41%) neurons became selective, at this point encoding information about whether the current trial was the only trial required or how many more trials are needed to obtain a reward. These cue-related responses had a median latency of 120 ms (just between the latencies in inferior temporal visual area TE and perirhinal cortex). When the monkey was releasing a touch bar to complete the trial correctly, 71 of 246 (29%) neurons responded, with responses in the rewarded trials being similar no matter which schedule was ending, thus being sensitive to the reward contingency. Finally, 39 of 246 (16%) neurons responded around the reward. We suggest that basolateral amygdala, by anticipating and then delineating the schedule and representing reward contingency, provide contextual information that is important for adjusting motivational level as a function of immediate behavior goals.",

         "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation.",

         "Over the past two decades, the role of apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs has become clear. Apoptosis may occur via a death receptor‐dependent (extrinsic) or independent (intrinsic or mitochondrial) pathway. Mitochondria play a central role in cell death in response to DNA damage, and mediate the interaction(s) of various cytoplasmic organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The mitochondrial pathway of cell death is mediated by Bcl‐2 family proteins, a group of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that regulate the passage of small molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis‐inducing factor, which activates caspase cascades, through the mitochondrial transition pore. In addition, apoptosis can induce autophagic cell death via crosstalk between the two pathways upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The current review focused on recent advances surrounding the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by anticancer agents and discussed potential molecular targets for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect(s) of anticancer agents.

         "Phytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in some cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many bacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phytochrome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features of a bonafide phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the chromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXα, which is produced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore was shown to be covalently attached via its A‐ring endo‐vinyl group to a cysteine residue outside the defined bilin lyase domain of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes. Site‐directed mutagenesis identified Cys12 and His247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility, respectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red‐light‐absorbing Pr form and immediately converted into a far‐red‐light‐absorbing Pfr‐enriched form. It shows the characteristic red/far‐red‐light‐induced photoreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that lacks the C15/16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to a 15Z/15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphorylation of PaBphP was demonstrated, confirming its role as a sensor kinase of a bacterial two‐component signaling system.",

         "Two subfamilies of the polar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) located on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis, along with unknown phospholipids, were recently shown to participate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages (Villeneuve, C., G. Etienne, V. Abadie, H. Montrozier, C. Bordier, F. Laval, M. Daffe, I. Maridonneau-Parini, and C. Astarie-Dequeker. 2003. Surface-exposed glycopeptidolipids of Mycobacterium smegmatis specifically inhibit the phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages. Identification of a novel family of glycopeptidolipids. J. Biol. Chem. 278: 51291–51300). As demonstrated herein, a phospholipid mixture that derived from the methanol-insoluble fraction inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis. Inhibition was essentially attributable to phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), namely PIM2 and PIM6, because the purified phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were inactive. This was further confirmed using purified PIM2 and PIM6 from M. bovis BCG that decreased by half the internalization of M. smegmatis. Both compounds also inhibited the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium but had no effect on the internalization of zymosan used as a control particle of the phagocytic process. When coated on latex beads, PIM2 and polar GPL (GPL III) favored the particle entry through complement receptor 3. GPL III, but not PIM2, also directed particle entry through the mannose receptor. Therefore, surface-exposed mycobacterial PIM and polar GPL participate in the receptor-dependent internalization of mycobacteria in human macrophages.",

         "Few researchers would dispute that the pandemic of obesity is caused by a profound mismatch between humanity's present environmental circumstances and those that have moulded evolutionary selection. This concept was first articulated when gestational diabetes was described as being the result of a ‘thrifty genotype rendered detrimental by progress’. More recently, this hypothesis has been extended to the concept of a ‘thrifty phenotype’ to describe the metabolic adaptations adopted as a survival strategy by a malnourished fetus; changes that may also be inappropriate to deal with a later life of affluence. Both the thrifty genotype and the thrifty phenotype hypotheses would predict that populations in some areas of the developing world would be at greater risk of obesity and its co-morbidities; a proposition to be explored in the present paper. To date thrifty genes remain little more than a nebulous concept propagated by the intuitive logic that man has been selected to survive episodic famine and seasonal hungry periods. Under such conditions those individuals who could lay down extra energy stores and use them most efficiently would have a survival advantage. The search for candidate thrifty genes needs to cover every aspect of human energy balance from food-seeking behaviour to the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The present paper will describe examples of attempts to find thrifty genes in three selected candidate areas: maternally-transmitted mitochondrial genes; the uncoupling proteins; apoE4, whose geographical distribution has been linked to a possible thrifty role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.",

         "Real-time prediction of video source traffic is an important step in many network management tasks such as dynamic bandwidth allocation and end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control strategies. In this paper, an adaptive prediction model for MPEG-coded traffic is developed. A novel technology is used, first developed in the signal processing community, called sparse basis selection. It is based on selecting a small subset of inputs (basis) from among a large dictionary of possible inputs. A new sparse basis selection algorithm is developed that is based on efficiently updating the input selection adaptively. When a new measurement is received, the proposed algorithm updates the selected inputs in a recursive manner. Thus, adaptability is not only in the weight adjustment, but also in the dynamic update of the inputs. The algorithm is applied to the problem of single-step-ahead prediction of MPEG-coded video source traffic, and the developed method achieves improved results, as compared to the published results in the literature. The present analysis indicates that the adaptive feature of the developed algorithm seems to add significant overall value.",

         "BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process. First, a BXH-2–specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence–binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-γ in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.",

         "The functions of 17beta-estradiol (E2) are mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta. ERs display similar DNA- and ligand-binding properties in vitro. However, ERbeta shows lower transcriptional activity than ERalpha from the estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent signaling. We predicted that distinct amino termini contribute to differences in transcription efficacies of ERs by affecting in situ ER-ERE interactions. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and a novel in situ ERE competition assay, which is based on the ability of ER to compete for ERE binding with a designer activator that constitutively induces transcription from an ERE-driven reporter construct. Interference of activator-mediated transcription by unliganded or liganded ERs was taken as an indication of ER-ERE interaction. Results revealed that ERs interacted with ERE similarly in the absence of E2. However, E2 enhanced the ERE binding of ERalpha but not that of ERbeta. The removal of the amino terminus increased the ERbeta-ERE interaction independent of E2. The ERbeta amino terminus also prevented E2-mediated enhancement of the chimeric ERalpha-ERE interaction. Thus, the amino terminus of ERbeta impairs the binding of ERbeta to ERE. The abrogation of ligand-dependent activation function 2 of the amino-terminally truncated ERbeta resulted in the manifestation of E2 effect on ERbeta-ERE interaction. This implies that E2-mediated enhancement of ERbeta-ERE interaction is masked by the activation function 2, whereas the intact amino terminus is a dominant region that decreases the binding of ERbeta to ERE. Thus, ERbeta-ERE interaction is independent of E2 and is impaired by its amino terminus. These findings provide an additional explanation for differences between ERalpha and ERbeta functions that could differentially affect the physiology and pathophysiology of E2 signaling.",

         "We present a mobile acoustic beacon based sensor node localization method. Our technique is passive in that the sensor nodes themselves do not need to generate an acoustic signal for ranging. This saves cost, power and provides stealthy operation. Furthermore, the beacon can generate much more acoustic energy than a severely resource constrained sensor node, thereby significantly increasing the range. The acoustic ranging method uses a linear frequency modulated signal that can be accurately detected by matched filtering. This provides longer range and higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The localization algorithm was especially designed to work in such acoustically reverberant environment, as urban terrain. The algorithm presented handles non-Gaussian ranging errors caused by echoes. Node locations are computed centrally by solving a global non-linear optimization problem in an iterative and incremental fashion",

         "Impact of Software Vulnerability Announcements on the Market Value of Software Vendors - an Empirical Investigation",
         "Researchers in the area of information security have mainly been concerned with tools, techniques and policies that firms can use to protect themselves against security breaches. However, information security is as much about security software as it is about secure software. Software is not secure when it has defects or flaws which can be exploited by hackers to cause attacks such as unauthorized intrusion or denial of service attacks. Any public announcement makes about a software defect is termed as 'vulnerability disclosure'. Although research in software economics have studied firms' incentive to improve overall quality, there have been no studies to show that software vendors have an incentive to invest in building more secure software. In this paper, we use the event study methodology to examine software vendors' incentives to build more secure software. We collect data from leading national newspapers and industry sources like CERT by searching for reports on published software vulnerabilities. We show that vulnerability disclosures lead to a negative and significant change in market value for a software vendor. On average, a vendor loses around 0.6% value in stock price when a vulnerability is reported. This is equivalent to a loss in market capitalization values of $0.86 billion per vulnerability announcement. To provide further insight, we use the information content of the disclosure announcement to classify vulnerabilities into various types. We find that the change in stock price is more negative if the vendor fails to provide a patch at the time of disclosure. Moreover, vulnerabilities which cause a confidentiality related breach cause a greater decline in the market value for a vendor than the vulnerabilities which cause non-confidentiality related breaches. Also, more severe flaws have a significantly greater impact than flaws with low or moderate severity. Finally, we find that the markets do not punish a software vendor more severely if a third party discovers a flaw in its product than if the vendor itself discovers the flaw. Our analysis provides many interesting implications for software vendors as well as policy makers.",

         "ABSTRACT Reliable and sensitive quantification of Phytophthora capsici in pepper plants is of crucial importance in managing the multiple syndromes caused by this pathogen. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the determination of P. capsici in pepper tissues. DNA levels of a highly virulent and a less virulent isolate were measured in different pepper genotypes with varying degrees of resistance. Using SYBR Green and specific primers for P. capsici, the minimal amount of pathogen DNA quantified was 10 pg. Pathogen DNA was recorded as early as 8 h postinoculation. Thereafter, the increase was rapid in susceptible cultivars and slower in resistant ones. The amount of pathogen DNA quantified in each pepper genotype correlated with susceptibility to Phytophthora root rot. Likewise, there was a relationship between the virulence of the pathogen and the degree of colonization. Differences also were found in oomycete amount among pepper tissues, with maximal pathogen biomass occurring in stems. The real-time PCR technique developed in this study was sensitive and robust enough to assess both pathogen development and resistance to Phytophthora root rot in different pepper genotypes.",

         "ABSTRACT Growth, patterning, and apoptosis are mutually interactive during development. For example, cells that select an abnormal fate in a developing field are frequently removed by apoptosis. An important issue in this process that needs to be resolved is the mechanism used by cells to discern their correct fate from an abnormal fate. In order to examine this issue, we developed an animal model that expresses the dioxin receptor homolog Spineless (Ss) ectopically in the Drosophila wing. The presence of mosaic clones ectopically expressing ss results in a local transformation of organ identity, homeosis, from wing into a leg or antenna. The cells with misspecified fates subsequently activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase to undergo apoptosis in an autonomous or nonautonomous manner depending on their position within the wing, suggesting that a cell-cell interaction is, at least in some cases, involved in the detection of misspecified cells. Similar position dependence is commonly observed when various homeotic genes controlling the body segments are ectopically expressed. The autonomous and nonautonomous apoptosis caused by ss is regulated by a novel leucine-rich repeat family transmembrane protein, Fish-lips (Fili) that interacts with surrounding normal cells. These data support a mechanism in which the lack of some membrane proteins helps to recognize the presence of different cell types and direct these cells to an apoptotic fate in order to exclude them from the normal developing field.",

         "The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression (\"reverse immunology\"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in proteomics for the identification of tumor antigens. These advances are opening the door for targeted vaccine development, and for using immune response signatures as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",

         "Two variants of the renal Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2), called NKCC2A and NKCC2F, display marked differences in Na+, Rb+, and Cl- affinities, yet are identical to one another except for a 23-residue membrane-associated domain that is derived from alternatively spliced exons. The proximal portion of these exons is predicted to encode the second transmembrane domain (tm2) in the form of an α-helix, and the distal portion, part of the following connecting segment (cs1a). In recent studies, we have taken advantage of the A–F differences in kinetic behavior to determine which regions in tm2-cs1a are involved in ion transport. Functional characterizations of chimeras in which tm2 or cs1a were interchanged between the variants showed that both regions are important in specifying ion affinities, but did not allow delineating the contribution of individual residues. Here, we have extended these structure-function analyses by studying additional mutants in which variant residues between A and F were interchanged individually in the tm2-cs1a region (amino acid number 216, 220, 223, 229, or 233 in NKCC2). None of the substitutions were found to affect Km (C1-), suggesting that the affinity difference for anion transport is conveyed by a combination of variant residues in this domain. However, 2 substitutions in the tm2 of F were found to affect cation constants specifically; interestingly, one of these mutations (residue 216) only affected Km (Rb+) while the other (residue 220) only affected Km (Na+). We have thus identified two novel residues in NKCC2 that play a key role in cation transport. Because such residues should be adjacent to one another on the vertical axis of the tm2 α-helix, our results imply, furthermore, that the ion transport sites in NKCC2 could be physically linked.",

         "BACKGROUND\nElevated concentrations of homocysteine in blood may be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations can be caused by decreased methylation of homocysteine to form methionine, as occurs in folate deficiency. A parallel pathway exists for methylation of homocysteine, in which choline, by way of betaine, is the methyl donor.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to determine whether choline deficiency results in a decreased capacity to methylate homocysteine.\n\n\nDESIGN\nC57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, or 35 mmol choline/kg diet for 3 wk. We then administered an oral methionine load to the animals and measured plasma homocysteine concentrations. Also, in a pilot study, we examined 8 men who were fed a diet providing 550 mg choline/d per 70 kg body weight for 10 d, followed by a diet providing almost no choline, until the subjects were clinically judged to be choline deficient or for <or=42 d. A methionine load was administered at the end of each dietary phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hours after the methionine load, choline-deficient mice had plasma homocysteine concentrations twice those of choline-fed mice. Four hours after the methionine load, clinically choline-depleted men had plasma homocysteine concentrations that were 35% greater than those in men not choline depleted.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that choline, like folate, plays an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine in humans and that response to a methionine load may be useful when assessing choline nutriture.",

         "Di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) is a common plasticizer and solvent that disrupts androgen-dependent male reproductive development in rats. In utero exposure to 500 mg/kg/day DBP on gestation days (GD) 12 to 21 decreases androgen biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in decreased fetal testicular testosterone levels. One consequence of prenatal DBP exposure is malformed epididymides in adult rats. Reduced fetal testosterone levels may be responsible for the malformation, since testosterone is required for Wolffian duct stabilization and their development into epididymides. Currently, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms of Wolffian duct differentiation. The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression associated with altered morphology of the proximal Wolffian duct following in utero exposure to DBP. Pregnant Crl:CD(R) (SD) rats were gavaged with corn oil vehicle or 500 mg/kg/day DBP from GD 12 to GD 19 or 21. There were only small morphological differences between control and DBP-exposed Wolffian ducts on GD 19. On GD 21, 89% of male fetuses in the DBP dose group showed marked underdevelopment of Wolffian ducts, characterized by decreased coiling. RNA was isolated from Wolffian ducts on GD 19 and 21. Together with empirical information, cDNA microarrays were used to help identify candidate genes that could be associated with the morphological changes observed on GD 21. These candidate genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Changes in mRNA expression were observed in genes within the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, the extracellular matrix, and in other developmentally conserved signaling pathways. On GD 19, immunolocalization of IGF-1 receptor protein demonstrated an increase in cytoplasmic expression in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells. There was also a variable decrease in androgen receptor protein in ductal epithelial cells on GD 19. This study provides insight into the effects of antiandrogens on the molecular mechanisms involved in Wolffian duct development. The altered morphology and changes in gene expression following DBP exposure are suggestive of altered paracrine interactions between ductal epithelial cells and the surrounding mesenchyme during Wolffian duct differentiation due to lowered testosterone production.",

We exploit the depth resolution of a/LCI to exclusively examine the basal layer of the epithelium, approximately 50 to 100 microm beneath the tissue surface, without the need for exogenous contrast agents, tissue sectioning, or fixation. The results of two studies are presented that compare the performance of two a/LCI modalities. Overall, the combined studies show 91% sensitivity and 97% specificity for detecting dysplasia, using histopathology as the standard. In addition, the studies enable the effects of dietary chemopreventive agents, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and curcumin, to be assessed by observing modulation in the incidence of neoplastic change. We demonstrate that a/LCI is highly effective for monitoring neoplastic change and can be applied to assessing the efficacy of chemopreventive agents in the rat esophagus.",

         "It has been argued that phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli elicit preattentive capture of attention. To distinguish between fear relevance and time of appearance in evolutionary history, the authors compare phylogenetic and ontogenetic fear-relevant and fear-irrelevant stimuli in a visual search task. The authors found no evidence for a special role of phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli; it seems that fear relevance in general is more important than is the evolutionary age. The pattern of results indicates that attention toward threatening stimuli is mainly affected by a late component that prolongs the disengagement of attention.",

         "WBN/Kob-Ht rats (Ht-rats) raised under conventional conditions spontaneously developed dermatitis. In this study, we carried out histopathological analysis to elucidate the pathological features of the dermatitis in Ht-rats. We then tried to detect Staphylococcus species recovered from the skin lesions of Ht-rats. We also measured the serum levels of total IgE, IL-4 and IFN-gamma in these rats. The histopathological data indicated that inflammatory cells had infiltrated the skin lesions. Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from the skin lesions, and the serum levels of total IgE and IL-4 were elevated in Ht-rats with dermatitis. These results suggest that dermatitis in Ht-rats is similar to that in the DS-Nh mice, which has recently been proposed as an animal model for human atopic dermatitis.",

         "Rat Strain Effects of AT1 Receptor Activation on D1 Dopamine Receptors in Immortalized Renal Proximal Tubule Cells",
         "The dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems regulate blood pressure, in part, by affecting sodium transport in renal proximal tubules (RPTs). We have reported that activation of a D1-like receptor decreases AT1 receptor expression in the mouse kidney and in immortalized RPT cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The current studies were designed to test the hypothesis that activation of the AT1 receptor can also regulate the D1 receptor in RPT cells, and this regulation is aberrant in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Long-term (24 hours) stimulation of RPT cells with angiotensin II, via AT1 receptors increased total cellular D1 receptor protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in WKY but not in SHR cells. Short-term stimulation (15 minutes) with angiotensin II did not affect total cellular D1 receptor protein in either rat strain. However, in the short-term experiments, angiotensin II decreased cell surface membrane D1 receptor protein in WKY but not in SHR cells. D1 and AT1 receptors colocalized (confocal microscopy) and their coimmunoprecipitation was greater in WKY than in SHRs. However, AT1/D1 receptor coimmunoprecipitation was decreased by angiotensin II (10−8M/24 hours) to a similar extent in WKY (−22±8%) and SHRs (−22±12%). In summary, these studies show that AT1 and D1 receptors interact differently in RPT cells from WKY and SHRs. It is possible that an angiotensin II-mediated increase in D1 receptors and dissociation of AT1 from D1 receptors serve to counter regulate the long-term action of angiotensin II in WKY rats; different effects are seen in SHRs.",

This report describes a metastatic GIST that stained strongly for cytokeratins, CD117, and CD34 in a patient who was previously diagnosed with gastric epithelioid angiosarcoma. A review of both tumours showed the same histological and immunohistochemical profiles, and c-kit molecular analysis revealed an insertional mutation at codon 558 of exon 11 in both tumours. Thus, pathologists should be aware that GISTs can occasionally express cytokeratins, and that c-kit mutational investigations may have a key diagnostic role and may prevent diagnostic mistakes that could have important clinical implications.",

         "Contribution of high p34cdc2 kinase activity to premature chromosome condensation of injected somatic cell nuclei in rat oocytes.",
         "The present study was undertaken to clarify the relationship between the p34cdc2 kinase activity of in vitro-aged or enucleated rat oocytes and the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) of microinjected cumulus cell nuclei. Wistar rat oocytes were placed in vitro up to 120 min after the animal was killed. The p34cdc2 kinase activity of the oocytes decreased in a time-dependent manner. The incidence of PCC was higher when nuclear injection into intact oocytes was completed in 15-45 min rather than 46-120 min. When rat oocytes were enucleated for subsequent nuclear injection, the p34cdc2 kinase activity transiently increased soon after enucleation but drastically decreased after 30 min. Removal of the cytoplasm instead of the meta-phase-plate did not affect the p34cdc2 kinase activity even after 60 min. PCC occurred in intact and cytoplasm-removed oocytes but not in enucleated oocytes. In contrast, oocytes from BDF1 mice exhibited a p34cdc2 kinase level twice that of rat oocytes and supported PCC despite enucleation. The p34cdc2 kinase level of intact rat oocytes was reduced to the equivalent level of aged (120 min) or enucleated (+60 min) oocytes by a 45 min treatment with roscovitine, an inhibitor of p34cdc2 kinase. None of the roscovitine-treated oocytes supported PCC while half of the control oocytes did. When rat oocytes were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, delayed inactivation of the p34cdc2 kinase was observed in the MG132-treated oocytes. A significantly higher proportion of the MG132-treated oocytes supported PCC when compared with the control oocytes. Moreover, a higher proportion of MG132-treated and enucleated oocytes carried two pseudo-pronuclei after cumulus cell injection and developed to the two-cell stage when compared with the enucleated oocytes at the telophase-II stage. These results suggest that the decreased level of p34cdc2 kinase activity in aged or enucleated rat oocytes is responsible for their inability to support PCC of microinjected donor cell nuclei and that inhibition of p34cdc2 kinase inactivation by chemicals such as MG132 is in part effective for rat oocytes to promote PCC and further development.",

         "OBJECTIVES\nTo compare the agreement between microbroth dilution and agar dilution for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Campylobacter jejuni.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUtilizing commercially prepared antimicrobial panels, microbroth dilution was compared with agar dilution for determining antimicrobial susceptibility in C. jejuni isolates. To assess the performance of both techniques for ampicillin, 190 C. jejuni isolates from dairy cattle were utilized. A group of 172 C. jejuni isolates from dairy sources were used to compare the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur results indicate that microbroth dilution and agar dilution agree within +/-1 log2 dilution for 86.7% of the isolates tested. Ciprofloxacin had the highest level of agreement for isolates tested by both techniques, resulting in a kappa of 0.886 and 97.1% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution. The least agreement was observed in determining the susceptibility of isolates to ampicillin and erythromycin (82.1 and 79.7% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution). However, kappa statistics were considered to have good agreement for these antimicrobials. There were no significant differences in the summary statistics for any of the five antimicrobials evaluated for the isolates analysed by the percentage of resistant isolates, MIC50, MIC75 or MIC90 beyond +/-1 log2 dilution. There was no association in the classification of resistance by the testing methods employed. We also demonstrated that the quality control strain of C. jejuni ATCC 33650 performed in a consistent manner for both agar dilution and microbroth dilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMicrobroth dilution may be an acceptable alternative to agar dilution for determining susceptibility of C. jejuni in research or surveillance where flow of samples, labour efficiency and cost may restrict the use of agar dilution.",

         "Explicit computational formulas for the coefficients of the periodic normal forms for all codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles in generic autonomous ODEs are derived. They include second-order coefficients for the fold (limit point) bifurcation, as well as third-order coefficients for the flip (period-doubling) and Neimark--Sacker (torus) bifurcations. The formulas are independent of the dimension of the phase space and involve solutions of certain boundary-value problems on the interval [0,T], where T is the period of the critical cycle, as well as multilinear functions from the Taylor expansion of the right-hand sides near the cycle. The formulas allow us to distinguish between sub- and supercritical bifurcations, in agreement with earlier asymptotic expansions of the bifurcating solutions. Our formulation makes it possible to use robust numerical boundary-value algorithms based on orthogonal collocation, rather than shooting techniques, which greatly expands its applicability. The actual implementation is described in detail. We include three numerical examples, in which codim 2 singularities are detected along branches of codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles as zeros of the periodic normal form coefficients.",
