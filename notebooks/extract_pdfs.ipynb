         "Purpose: Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, the growth regulatory mechanisms of which are unknown. We investigated the involvement of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals in synovial sarcoma and evaluated the therapeutic effect of inhibiting the FGF signal. Experimental Design: The expression of 22 FGF and 4 FGF receptor (FGFR) genes in 18 primary tumors and five cell lines of synovial sarcoma were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Effects of recombinant FGF2, FGF8, and FGF18 for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the growth of synovial sarcoma cell lines were analyzed. Growth inhibitory effects of FGFR inhibitors on synovial sarcoma cell lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results: Synovial sarcoma cell lines expressed multiple FGF genes especially those expressed in neural tissues, among which FGF8 showed growth stimulatory effects in all synovial sarcoma cell lines. FGF signals in synovial sarcoma induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38MAPK but not c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Disruption of the FGF signaling pathway in synovial sarcoma by specific inhibitors of FGFR caused cell cycle arrest leading to significant growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition by the FGFR inhibitor was associated with a down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 but not p38MAPK, and an ERK kinase inhibitor also showed growth inhibitory effects for synovial sarcoma, indicating that the growth stimulatory effect of FGF was transmitted through the ERK1/2. Conclusions: FGF signals have an important role in the growth of synovial sarcoma, and inhibitory molecules will be of potential use for molecular target therapy in synovial sarcoma.",

         "This study was designed to investigate the effects of the aqueous ethanol extract of Astragalus membranaceus BUNGE (Leguminosae) on rat thoracic aorta. Isometric tension was recorded in response to drugs in organ bath. In endothelium-intact aortic rings, A. membranaceus extract induced a significant dose-dependent relaxation of the rings precontracted by phenylephrine, which could be inhibited by preincubation with L-N(omega)-nitro-arginine methyl ester or methylthioninium chloride. In endothelium-denuded ones, the extract could dose-dependently relax the rings contracted by phenylephrine, not by KCl; and it could also attenuate contractile response to phenylephrine, not to caffeine or phorbol-12,13-diacetate in Ca(2+)-free medium; but it failed to affect the CaCl(2)-induced enhancement of contractile response to phenylephrine in Ca(2+)-free medium. These results indicate that nitric oxide signaling and Ca(2+)-handling pathway are involved in the A. membranaceus extract-induced vasodilatation.",

         "Critical roles of CD146 in zebrafish vascular development",
         "In this report, we use zebrafish as a model system to understand the importance of CD146 in vascular development. Endothelial‐specific expression of CD146 was verified by whole‐mount in situ hybridization. Suppression of CD146 protein expression by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) resulted in poorly developed intersomitic vessels (ISVs). In CD146 morphants, we observed a lack of blood flow through the ISV region, despite that fluorescence microangiography showed that the ISVs were present. This finding suggests that the lumens of the developing ISVs may be too narrow for proper circulation. Additionally, remodeling of the caudal vein plexus into functional vascular tubes appeared to be affected. Suppression of CD146 protein expression resulted in a circulation shunt that caused the circulation to by‐pass part of the caudal artery/vein system. The same vascular defects were recapitulated by using a second morpholino oligonucleotide. This morphant expressed a truncated CD146 protein with amino acids V32 to T57 at the N terminus deleted in an in‐frame manner. This region, therefore, is likely to contain elements critical for CD146 function. This study provides the first in vivo functional assessment of CD146 in embryonic development by showing that knockdown of CD146 protein expression severely hinders vascular development in zebrafish.

         "Differential Contribution of Troponin I Phosphorylation Sites to the Endothelin-modulated Contractile Response*",
         "Cardiac troponin I is a phosphorylation target for endothelin-activated protein kinase C. Earlier work in cardiac myocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I provided evidence that protein kinase C-mediated cardiac troponin I phosphorylation accelerates relaxation. However, replacement with the slow skeletal isoform also alters the myofilament pH response and the Ca2+ transient, which could influence endothelin-mediated relaxation. Here, differences in the Ca2+ transient could not explain the divergent relaxation response to endothelin in myocytes expressing cardiac versus slow skeletal troponin I nor could activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Three separate clusters within cardiac troponin I are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and we set out to determine the contribution of the Thr144 and Ser23/Ser24 clusters to the endothelin-mediated contractile response. Myocyte replacement with a cardiac troponin I containing a Thr144 substituted with the Pro residue found in slow skeletal troponin I resulted in prolonged relaxation in response to acute endothelin compared with control myocytes. Ser23/Ser24 also is a target for protein kinase C phosphorylation of purified cardiac troponin I, and although this cluster was not acutely phosphorylated in intact myocytes, significant phosphorylation developed within 1 h after adding endothelin. Replacement of Ser23/Ser24 with Ala indicated that this cluster contributes significantly to relaxation during more prolonged endothelin stimulation. Overall, results with these mutants provide evidence that Thr144 plays an important role in the acute acceleration of relaxation, whereas Ser23/Ser24 contributes to relaxation during more prolonged activation of protein kinase C by endothelin.",

The factors included prior academic experience, prior computer experience, self-perception of programming performance and comfort level on the module and specific cognitive skills. The study found that a student's perception of their understanding of the module had the strongest correlation with programming performance, r=0.76, p‹0.01. In addition, Leaving Certificate (LC) mathematics and science scores were shown to have a strong correlation with performance. A regression module, based upon a student's perception of their understanding of the module, gender, LC mathematics score and comfort level was able to account for 79% of the variance in programming performance results.",

         "Objective—The high and low responder phenomenon describes individual differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocyte tissue factor (TF) activity. We characterized patterns of intracellular accumulation, externalization, and shedding of TF in response to LPS in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). Methods and Results—After 2 hours of LPS stimulation of whole blood, flow cytometry analyses revealed a larger population of TF-positive monocytes in HRs (32.0±3.5%) versus LRs (11.2±1.2%; P≤0.05), along with a stronger mean fluorescence intensity of TF signal in HRs (7.1±0.5 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with LRs (5.4±0.4 AU; P≤0.05). The LPS-treated blood of the HR group contained 2-fold more TF-positive microparticles than LRs. In-cell Western assay demonstrated higher intracellular accumulation of TF in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from LRs because LPS induced a 3.7-fold increase of total TF levels in LRs versus a 1.5-fold increase in HRs. In contrast, in response to LPS stimulation, MNCs from HRs exhibited a 4-fold induction of surface TF, whereas MNCs from LRs only had a minor increase in surface TF levels. Conclusions—The higher availability of surface TF antigen on MNCs from HRs and TF-containing microparticles might make these individuals more susceptible to hypercoagulation.",

         "Cbl proteins have been implicated in ligand-induced TCR/CD3 down-modulation, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed the effect of mutation of a cbl-binding site on ZAP-70 (ZAP-Y292F) on dynamics, internalization, and degradation of the TCR/CD3 complex in response to distinct stimuli. Naive CD8 T cells expressing the P14 transgenic TCR from ZAP-Y292F mice were selectively affected in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to antigenic stimulation, whereas neither anti-CD3 Ab-, and PMA-induced TCR down-modulation, nor constitutive receptor endocytosis/cycling were impaired. We further established that the defect in TCR/CD3 down-modulation in response to Ag was paralleled by an impaired TCR/CD3 internalization and CD3ζ degradation. Analysis of T/APC conjugates revealed that delayed redistribution of TCR at the T/APC contact zone was paralleled by a delay in TCR internalization in the synaptic zone in ZAP-Y292F compared with ZAP-wild-type T cells. Cbl recruitment to the synapse was also retarded in ZAP-Y292F T cells, although F-actin and LFA-1 redistribution was similar for both cell types. This study identifies a step involving ZAP-70/cbl interaction that is critical for rapid internalization of the TCR/CD3 complex at the CD8 T cell/APC synapse.",

         "Applying Machine Learning Techniques to Improve Linux Process Scheduling",
         "In this work we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn the CPU time-slice utilization behavior of known programs in a Linux system. Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The \"Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis\" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C'4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution. We find our result interesting in the context that generally operating systems presently never make use of a program's previous execution history in their scheduling behavior.",

         "ABSTRACT Neuronal leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRRs) are type I transmembrane proteins and expressed in neuronal tissues, but their function remains unknown. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a new member of the NLRR family, NLRR4, and its potential role in long-lasting memory. We generated NLRR4-deficient (NLRR4−/−) mice and found that they showed impaired memory retention. In hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, NLRR4−/− mice were able to learn and maintain the memories for one day but unable to retain the memories for four days after learning. In contrast, in a hippocampus-independent task, NLRR4−/− mice were able to retain the memory normally for at least seven days. These results suggest that NLRR4 plays a key role in hippocampus-dependent long-lasting memory.",

         "We present an encoding framework which exploits semantics for video content delivery. The video content is organized based on the idea of main content message. In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.",

         "ABSTRACT Of the nasopharyngeal cultures recovered from 942 day care center (DCC) attendees in Lisbon, Portugal, 591 (62%) yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae during a surveillance performed in February and March of 1999. Forty percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. In particular, 2% were penicillin resistant and 20% had intermediate penicillin resistance. Multidrug resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracycline was the most frequent antibiotype (17% of all isolates). Serotyping and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were performed for 202 out of 237 drug-resistant pneumococci (DRPn). The most frequent serotypes were 6B (26%), 14 (22%), 19F (16%), 23F (10%), and nontypeable (12%). The majority (67%) of the DRPn strains were representatives of nine international clones included in the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network; eight of them had been detected in previous studies. Fourteen novel clones were identified, corresponding to 26% of the DRPn strains. The remaining 7% of the strains were local clones detected in our previous studies. Comparison with studies conducted since 1996 in Portuguese DCCs identified several trends: (i) the rate of DRPn frequency has fluctuated between 40 and 50%; (ii) the serotypes most frequently recovered have remained the same; (iii) nontypeable strains appear to be increasing in frequency; and (iv) a clone of serotype 33F emerged in 1999. Together, our observations highlight that the nasopharynxes of children in DCCs are a melting pot of successful DRPn clones that are important to study and monitor if we aim to gain a better understanding on the epidemiology of this pathogen.",

         "Safe motion planning in dynamic environments",
         "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

         "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of mortality accounting for approximately 10% of all deaths from malignancy in the western world. Polymorphism in the glutathione S-transferase GSTT1 gene has been associated with CRC risk in some but not all studies. In this study, we examined associations between GSTT1 genotypes and CRC risk, and prognosis in 361 cases and 881 unrelated controls. GSTT1 null was associated with a small but significant increase in risk (P = 0.0006, odds ratio (OR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-2.24). GSTT1 null was also associated with a significantly younger age at diagnosis (mean 65.2 years) compared with GSTT1 A (mean 67.6 years, P = 0.031). There were no significant associations between GSTT1 genotypes and clinical factors (e.g. Dukes stage, differentiation and tumour node metastasis classification) in the total case group. However, following stratification by age (<70 versus > or =70 years at diagnosis), in the patients diagnosed <70 years of age, GSTT1 null was more common in Dukes grade A/B tumours (P = 0.046), stage T1/T2 tumours (P = 0.053) and those with a pushing margin (P = 0.066). We also identified associations between GSTT1 null and increased prevalence of host lymphocyte response, particularly in the younger patients (P = 0.036). Furthermore, GSTT1 null was associated with improved survival in younger patients (P = 0.017, hazards ratio (HR) = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.31-0.89) but poorer survival in older patients (P = 0.017, HR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.12-3.20). We proposed a model based on the dual functionality of GSTT1 to explain these contrasting results. We suggest that the null genotype is associated with improved immune response in younger patients, but poorer detoxification in older patients. These findings may also provide an explanation for the contrasting finding of other studies on the role of this gene in CRC.",

         "In eukaryotic cellular proteins, protein N‐myristoylation has been recognized as a protein modification that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic proteins. In this study, to search for a eukaryotic N‐myristoylated transmembrane protein, the susceptibility of the N‐terminus of several G‐protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) to protein N‐myristoylation was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling. It was found that the N‐terminal 10 residues of B96Bom, a Bombyx mori GPCR, efficiently directed the protein N‐myristoylation. Analysis of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) fusion protein with the N‐terminal 90 residues of B96Bom at its N‐terminus revealed that (a) transmembrane domain 1 of B96Bom functioned as a type I signal anchor sequence, (b) the N‐myristoylated N‐terminal domain (58 residues) was translocated across the membrane, and (c) two N‐glycosylation motifs located in this domain were efficiently N‐glycosylated. In addition, when Ala4 in the N‐myristoylation motif of B96Bom90‐TNF, Met‐Gly‐Gln‐Ala‐Ala‐Thr(1–6), was replaced with Asn to generate a new N‐glycosylation motif, Asn‐Ala‐Thr(4–6), efficient N‐glycosylation was observed on this newly introduced N‐glycosylation site in the expressed protein. These results indicate that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of B96Bom is translocated across the membrane and exposed to the extracellular surface. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a eukaryotic transmembrane protein can be N‐myristoylated and that the N‐myristoylated N‐terminus of the protein can be translocated across the membrane.",

         "Uptake of denatured collagen into hepatic stellate cells: evidence for the involvement of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein/Endo180.",
         "Tissue remodelling is dependent on the integration of signals that control turnover of ECM (extracellular matrix). Breakdown and endocytosis of collagen, a major component of the ECM, is central to this process. Whereas controlled secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes (such as matrix metalloproteinases) has long been known to mediate ECM breakdown, it is becoming clear that uPARAP/Endo180 (where uPARAP stands for urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein) serves as a receptor that mediates endocytosis of collagen by several types of cells. In the liver, the stellate cells play a major role in turnover of ECM including collagens. These cells synthesize various collagens and also produce matrix metalloproteinases. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of rat hepatic stellate cells to endocytose and degrade 125I-labelled heat-denatured collagen I. It was found that the collagen is efficiently taken up and degraded by these cells. Degradation was inhibited by inhibitors of lysosomal proteases (leupeptin and E-64d) and the vacuolar proton pump (concanamycin A), indicating that it takes place in lysosomes. Furthermore, endocytosed FITC-labelled collagen was shown to reach late endocytic compartments in which it colocalized with LysoTracker (a marker of late endocytic compartments). Competition experiments showed that uPA and unlabelled collagen are capable of inhibiting binding and uptake of [125I]collagen in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Western-blot analysis of cell lysate (using a polyclonal rabbit human-Endo180 antiserum) revealed a single band at 180 kDa. In addition, the antiserum was capable of reducing [125I]collagen binding to the cell surface. Finally, using two primers designed from the human uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA sequence, the expression of uPARAP/Endo180 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR. These results together suggest that uPARAP/Endo180 mediates endocytosis of collagen in rat liver stellate cells.",

         "Protein function prediction using the Protein Link EXplorer (PLEX)",
         "UNLABELLED\nWe introduce the Protein Link EXplorer (PLEX), a web-based environment that allows the construction of a phylogenetic profile for any given amino acid sequence, and its comparison with profiles of approximately 350,000 predicted genes from 89 genomes, as a means of interactively identifying functionally linked genes and predicting protein function. PLEX can be searched iteratively and also enables searches for chromosomal gene neighbors and Rosetta Stone linkages. PLEX search results are accompanied by quantitative estimates of linkage confidence, enabling users to take advantage of coinheritance, operon and gene fusion-based methods for inferring gene function and reconstructing cellular systems and pathways.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nhttp://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/plex",

         "How and When Selection Experiments Might Actually be Useful1",
         "Abstract Laboratory natural selection and artificial selection are vital tools for addressing specific questions about evolutionary patterns of variation. Laboratory natural selection can illuminate whether a putative selective agent is capable of generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits and the extent to which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss theoretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken beyond model organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation.",

         "The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events. We recorded neurons from the basolateral complex of two monkeys while they performed visually cued schedules of sequential color discrimination trials, with both valid and random cues. When the cues were valid, the visual cue, which was present throughout each trial, indicated how many trials remained to be successfully completed before a reward. Seventy-six percent of recorded neurons showed response selectivity, with the selectivity depending on some aspects of the current schedule. After a reward, when the monkeys knew that the upcoming cue would be valid, 88 of 246 (36%) neurons responded between schedules, seemingly anticipating the receiving information about the upcoming schedule length. When the cue appeared, 102 of 246 (41%) neurons became selective, at this point encoding information about whether the current trial was the only trial required or how many more trials are needed to obtain a reward. These cue-related responses had a median latency of 120 ms (just between the latencies in inferior temporal visual area TE and perirhinal cortex). When the monkey was releasing a touch bar to complete the trial correctly, 71 of 246 (29%) neurons responded, with responses in the rewarded trials being similar no matter which schedule was ending, thus being sensitive to the reward contingency. Finally, 39 of 246 (16%) neurons responded around the reward. We suggest that basolateral amygdala, by anticipating and then delineating the schedule and representing reward contingency, provide contextual information that is important for adjusting motivational level as a function of immediate behavior goals.",

         "The role of microRNA genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma.",
         "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation.",

         "Recent advances in understanding the cell death pathways activated by anticancer therapy",
         "Over the past two decades, the role of apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs has become clear. Apoptosis may occur via a death receptor‐dependent (extrinsic) or independent (intrinsic or mitochondrial) pathway. Mitochondria play a central role in cell death in response to DNA damage, and mediate the interaction(s) of various cytoplasmic organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The mitochondrial pathway of cell death is mediated by Bcl‐2 family proteins, a group of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins that regulate the passage of small molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis‐inducing factor, which activates caspase cascades, through the mitochondrial transition pore. In addition, apoptosis can induce autophagic cell death via crosstalk between the two pathways upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The current review focused on recent advances surrounding the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by anticancer agents and discussed potential molecular targets for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect(s) of anticancer agents.

         "Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of the bacterial phytochrome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa",
         "Phytochromes are photochromic biliproteins found in plants as well as in some cyanotrophic, photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In many bacteria, their function is largely unknown. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant bacterial phytochrome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaBphP). The recombinant protein displays all the characteristic features of a bonafide phytochrome. In contrast with cyanobacteria and plants, the chromophore of this bacterial phytochrome is biliverdin IXα, which is produced by the heme oxygenase BphO in P. aeruginosa. This chromophore was shown to be covalently attached via its A‐ring endo‐vinyl group to a cysteine residue outside the defined bilin lyase domain of plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes. Site‐directed mutagenesis identified Cys12 and His247 as being important for chromophore binding and photoreversibility, respectively. PaBphP is synthesized in the dark in the red‐light‐absorbing Pr form and immediately converted into a far‐red‐light‐absorbing Pfr‐enriched form. It shows the characteristic red/far‐red‐light‐induced photoreversibility of phytochromes. A chromophore analog that lacks the C15/16 double bond was used to show that this photoreversibility is due to a 15Z/15E isomerization of the biliverdin chromophore. Autophosphorylation of PaBphP was demonstrated, confirming its role as a sensor kinase of a bacterial two‐component signaling system.",

         "Two subfamilies of the polar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) located on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis, along with unknown phospholipids, were recently shown to participate in the nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages (Villeneuve, C., G. Etienne, V. Abadie, H. Montrozier, C. Bordier, F. Laval, M. Daffe, I. Maridonneau-Parini, and C. Astarie-Dequeker. 2003. Surface-exposed glycopeptidolipids of Mycobacterium smegmatis specifically inhibit the phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human macrophages. Identification of a novel family of glycopeptidolipids. J. Biol. Chem. 278: 51291–51300). As demonstrated herein, a phospholipid mixture that derived from the methanol-insoluble fraction inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis. Inhibition was essentially attributable to phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), namely PIM2 and PIM6, because the purified phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were inactive. This was further confirmed using purified PIM2 and PIM6 from M. bovis BCG that decreased by half the internalization of M. smegmatis. Both compounds also inhibited the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium but had no effect on the internalization of zymosan used as a control particle of the phagocytic process. When coated on latex beads, PIM2 and polar GPL (GPL III) favored the particle entry through complement receptor 3. GPL III, but not PIM2, also directed particle entry through the mannose receptor. Therefore, surface-exposed mycobacterial PIM and polar GPL participate in the receptor-dependent internalization of mycobacteria in human macrophages.",

         "Insights from the developing world: thrifty genotypes and thrifty phenotypes",
         "Few researchers would dispute that the pandemic of obesity is caused by a profound mismatch between humanity's present environmental circumstances and those that have moulded evolutionary selection. This concept was first articulated when gestational diabetes was described as being the result of a ‘thrifty genotype rendered detrimental by progress’. More recently, this hypothesis has been extended to the concept of a ‘thrifty phenotype’ to describe the metabolic adaptations adopted as a survival strategy by a malnourished fetus; changes that may also be inappropriate to deal with a later life of affluence. Both the thrifty genotype and the thrifty phenotype hypotheses would predict that populations in some areas of the developing world would be at greater risk of obesity and its co-morbidities; a proposition to be explored in the present paper. To date thrifty genes remain little more than a nebulous concept propagated by the intuitive logic that man has been selected to survive episodic famine and seasonal hungry periods. Under such conditions those individuals who could lay down extra energy stores and use them most efficiently would have a survival advantage. The search for candidate thrifty genes needs to cover every aspect of human energy balance from food-seeking behaviour to the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The present paper will describe examples of attempts to find thrifty genes in three selected candidate areas: maternally-transmitted mitochondrial genes; the uncoupling proteins; apoE4, whose geographical distribution has been linked to a possible thrifty role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.",

         "Real-time prediction of video source traffic is an important step in many network management tasks such as dynamic bandwidth allocation and end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control strategies. In this paper, an adaptive prediction model for MPEG-coded traffic is developed. A novel technology is used, first developed in the signal processing community, called sparse basis selection. It is based on selecting a small subset of inputs (basis) from among a large dictionary of possible inputs. A new sparse basis selection algorithm is developed that is based on efficiently updating the input selection adaptively. When a new measurement is received, the proposed algorithm updates the selected inputs in a recursive manner. Thus, adaptability is not only in the weight adjustment, but also in the dynamic update of the inputs. The algorithm is applied to the problem of single-step-ahead prediction of MPEG-coded video source traffic, and the developed method achieves improved results, as compared to the published results in the literature. The present analysis indicates that the adaptive feature of the developed algorithm seems to add significant overall value.",

         "BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process. First, a BXH-2–specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence–binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-γ in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.",

         "Binding of estrogen receptor beta to estrogen response element in situ is independent of estradiol and impaired by its amino terminus.",
         "The functions of 17beta-estradiol (E2) are mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta. ERs display similar DNA- and ligand-binding properties in vitro. However, ERbeta shows lower transcriptional activity than ERalpha from the estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent signaling. We predicted that distinct amino termini contribute to differences in transcription efficacies of ERs by affecting in situ ER-ERE interactions. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and a novel in situ ERE competition assay, which is based on the ability of ER to compete for ERE binding with a designer activator that constitutively induces transcription from an ERE-driven reporter construct. Interference of activator-mediated transcription by unliganded or liganded ERs was taken as an indication of ER-ERE interaction. Results revealed that ERs interacted with ERE similarly in the absence of E2. However, E2 enhanced the ERE binding of ERalpha but not that of ERbeta. The removal of the amino terminus increased the ERbeta-ERE interaction independent of E2. The ERbeta amino terminus also prevented E2-mediated enhancement of the chimeric ERalpha-ERE interaction. Thus, the amino terminus of ERbeta impairs the binding of ERbeta to ERE. The abrogation of ligand-dependent activation function 2 of the amino-terminally truncated ERbeta resulted in the manifestation of E2 effect on ERbeta-ERE interaction. This implies that E2-mediated enhancement of ERbeta-ERE interaction is masked by the activation function 2, whereas the intact amino terminus is a dominant region that decreases the binding of ERbeta to ERE. Thus, ERbeta-ERE interaction is independent of E2 and is impaired by its amino terminus. These findings provide an additional explanation for differences between ERalpha and ERbeta functions that could differentially affect the physiology and pathophysiology of E2 signaling.",

         "We present a mobile acoustic beacon based sensor node localization method. Our technique is passive in that the sensor nodes themselves do not need to generate an acoustic signal for ranging. This saves cost, power and provides stealthy operation. Furthermore, the beacon can generate much more acoustic energy than a severely resource constrained sensor node, thereby significantly increasing the range. The acoustic ranging method uses a linear frequency modulated signal that can be accurately detected by matched filtering. This provides longer range and higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The localization algorithm was especially designed to work in such acoustically reverberant environment, as urban terrain. The algorithm presented handles non-Gaussian ranging errors caused by echoes. Node locations are computed centrally by solving a global non-linear optimization problem in an iterative and incremental fashion",

         "Impact of Software Vulnerability Announcements on the Market Value of Software Vendors - an Empirical Investigation",
         "Researchers in the area of information security have mainly been concerned with tools, techniques and policies that firms can use to protect themselves against security breaches. However, information security is as much about security software as it is about secure software. Software is not secure when it has defects or flaws which can be exploited by hackers to cause attacks such as unauthorized intrusion or denial of service attacks. Any public announcement makes about a software defect is termed as 'vulnerability disclosure'. Although research in software economics have studied firms' incentive to improve overall quality, there have been no studies to show that software vendors have an incentive to invest in building more secure software. In this paper, we use the event study methodology to examine software vendors' incentives to build more secure software. We collect data from leading national newspapers and industry sources like CERT by searching for reports on published software vulnerabilities. We show that vulnerability disclosures lead to a negative and significant change in market value for a software vendor. On average, a vendor loses around 0.6% value in stock price when a vulnerability is reported. This is equivalent to a loss in market capitalization values of $0.86 billion per vulnerability announcement. To provide further insight, we use the information content of the disclosure announcement to classify vulnerabilities into various types. We find that the change in stock price is more negative if the vendor fails to provide a patch at the time of disclosure. Moreover, vulnerabilities which cause a confidentiality related breach cause a greater decline in the market value for a vendor than the vulnerabilities which cause non-confidentiality related breaches. Also, more severe flaws have a significantly greater impact than flaws with low or moderate severity. Finally, we find that the markets do not punish a software vendor more severely if a third party discovers a flaw in its product than if the vendor itself discovers the flaw. Our analysis provides many interesting implications for software vendors as well as policy makers.",

         "ABSTRACT Reliable and sensitive quantification of Phytophthora capsici in pepper plants is of crucial importance in managing the multiple syndromes caused by this pathogen. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the determination of P. capsici in pepper tissues. DNA levels of a highly virulent and a less virulent isolate were measured in different pepper genotypes with varying degrees of resistance. Using SYBR Green and specific primers for P. capsici, the minimal amount of pathogen DNA quantified was 10 pg. Pathogen DNA was recorded as early as 8 h postinoculation. Thereafter, the increase was rapid in susceptible cultivars and slower in resistant ones. The amount of pathogen DNA quantified in each pepper genotype correlated with susceptibility to Phytophthora root rot. Likewise, there was a relationship between the virulence of the pathogen and the degree of colonization. Differences also were found in oomycete amount among pepper tissues, with maximal pathogen biomass occurring in stems. The real-time PCR technique developed in this study was sensitive and robust enough to assess both pathogen development and resistance to Phytophthora root rot in different pepper genotypes.",

         "Wing-to-Leg Homeosis by Spineless Causes Apoptosis Regulated by Fish-lips, a Novel Leucine-Rich Repeat Transmembrane Protein",
         "ABSTRACT Growth, patterning, and apoptosis are mutually interactive during development. For example, cells that select an abnormal fate in a developing field are frequently removed by apoptosis. An important issue in this process that needs to be resolved is the mechanism used by cells to discern their correct fate from an abnormal fate. In order to examine this issue, we developed an animal model that expresses the dioxin receptor homolog Spineless (Ss) ectopically in the Drosophila wing. The presence of mosaic clones ectopically expressing ss results in a local transformation of organ identity, homeosis, from wing into a leg or antenna. The cells with misspecified fates subsequently activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase to undergo apoptosis in an autonomous or nonautonomous manner depending on their position within the wing, suggesting that a cell-cell interaction is, at least in some cases, involved in the detection of misspecified cells. Similar position dependence is commonly observed when various homeotic genes controlling the body segments are ectopically expressed. The autonomous and nonautonomous apoptosis caused by ss is regulated by a novel leucine-rich repeat family transmembrane protein, Fish-lips (Fili) that interacts with surrounding normal cells. These data support a mechanism in which the lack of some membrane proteins helps to recognize the presence of different cell types and direct these cells to an apoptotic fate in order to exclude them from the normal developing field.",

         "The sentinel within: exploiting the immune system for cancer biomarkers.",
         "The release of proteins from tumors triggers an immune response in cancer patients. These tumor antigens arise from several mechanisms including tumor-specific alterations in protein expression, mutation, folding, degradation, or intracellular localization. Responses to most tumor antigens are rarely observed in healthy individuals, making the response itself a biomarker that betrays the presence of underlying cancer. Antibody immune responses show promise as clinical biomarkers because antibodies have long half-lives in serum, are easy to measure, and are stable in blood samples. However, our understanding of the specificity and the impact of the immune response in early stages of cancer is limited. The immune response to cancer, whether endogenous or driven by vaccines, involves highly specific T lymphocytes (which target tumor-derived peptides bound to self-MHC proteins) and B lymphocytes (which generate antibodies to tumor-derived proteins). T cell target antigens have been identified either by expression cloning from tumor cDNA libraries, or by prediction based on patterns of antigen expression (\"reverse immunology\"). B cell targets have been similarly identified using the antibodies in patient sera to screen cDNA libraries derived from tumor cell lines. This review focuses on the application of recent advances in proteomics for the identification of tumor antigens. These advances are opening the door for targeted vaccine development, and for using immune response signatures as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",

         "Molecular Mechanisms of Cation Transport by the Renal Na+-K+-Cl- Cotransporter",
         "Two variants of the renal Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2), called NKCC2A and NKCC2F, display marked differences in Na+, Rb+, and Cl- affinities, yet are identical to one another except for a 23-residue membrane-associated domain that is derived from alternatively spliced exons. The proximal portion of these exons is predicted to encode the second transmembrane domain (tm2) in the form of an α-helix, and the distal portion, part of the following connecting segment (cs1a). In recent studies, we have taken advantage of the A–F differences in kinetic behavior to determine which regions in tm2-cs1a are involved in ion transport. Functional characterizations of chimeras in which tm2 or cs1a were interchanged between the variants showed that both regions are important in specifying ion affinities, but did not allow delineating the contribution of individual residues. Here, we have extended these structure-function analyses by studying additional mutants in which variant residues between A and F were interchanged individually in the tm2-cs1a region (amino acid number 216, 220, 223, 229, or 233 in NKCC2). None of the substitutions were found to affect Km (C1-), suggesting that the affinity difference for anion transport is conveyed by a combination of variant residues in this domain. However, 2 substitutions in the tm2 of F were found to affect cation constants specifically; interestingly, one of these mutations (residue 216) only affected Km (Rb+) while the other (residue 220) only affected Km (Na+). We have thus identified two novel residues in NKCC2 that play a key role in cation transport. Because such residues should be adjacent to one another on the vertical axis of the tm2 α-helix, our results imply, furthermore, that the ion transport sites in NKCC2 could be physically linked.",

         "Choline deficiency in mice and humans is associated with increased plasma homocysteine concentration after a methionine load.",
         "BACKGROUND\nElevated concentrations of homocysteine in blood may be an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations can be caused by decreased methylation of homocysteine to form methionine, as occurs in folate deficiency. A parallel pathway exists for methylation of homocysteine, in which choline, by way of betaine, is the methyl donor.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to determine whether choline deficiency results in a decreased capacity to methylate homocysteine.\n\n\nDESIGN\nC57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, or 35 mmol choline/kg diet for 3 wk. We then administered an oral methionine load to the animals and measured plasma homocysteine concentrations. Also, in a pilot study, we examined 8 men who were fed a diet providing 550 mg choline/d per 70 kg body weight for 10 d, followed by a diet providing almost no choline, until the subjects were clinically judged to be choline deficient or for <or=42 d. A methionine load was administered at the end of each dietary phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hours after the methionine load, choline-deficient mice had plasma homocysteine concentrations twice those of choline-fed mice. Four hours after the methionine load, clinically choline-depleted men had plasma homocysteine concentrations that were 35% greater than those in men not choline depleted.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that choline, like folate, plays an important role in the metabolism of homocysteine in humans and that response to a methionine load may be useful when assessing choline nutriture.",

         "Altered gene expression during rat Wolffian duct development following di(n-butyl) phthalate exposure.",
         "Di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) is a common plasticizer and solvent that disrupts androgen-dependent male reproductive development in rats. In utero exposure to 500 mg/kg/day DBP on gestation days (GD) 12 to 21 decreases androgen biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in decreased fetal testicular testosterone levels. One consequence of prenatal DBP exposure is malformed epididymides in adult rats. Reduced fetal testosterone levels may be responsible for the malformation, since testosterone is required for Wolffian duct stabilization and their development into epididymides. Currently, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms of Wolffian duct differentiation. The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression associated with altered morphology of the proximal Wolffian duct following in utero exposure to DBP. Pregnant Crl:CD(R) (SD) rats were gavaged with corn oil vehicle or 500 mg/kg/day DBP from GD 12 to GD 19 or 21. There were only small morphological differences between control and DBP-exposed Wolffian ducts on GD 19. On GD 21, 89% of male fetuses in the DBP dose group showed marked underdevelopment of Wolffian ducts, characterized by decreased coiling. RNA was isolated from Wolffian ducts on GD 19 and 21. Together with empirical information, cDNA microarrays were used to help identify candidate genes that could be associated with the morphological changes observed on GD 21. These candidate genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Changes in mRNA expression were observed in genes within the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, the extracellular matrix, and in other developmentally conserved signaling pathways. On GD 19, immunolocalization of IGF-1 receptor protein demonstrated an increase in cytoplasmic expression in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells. There was also a variable decrease in androgen receptor protein in ductal epithelial cells on GD 19. This study provides insight into the effects of antiandrogens on the molecular mechanisms involved in Wolffian duct development. The altered morphology and changes in gene expression following DBP exposure are suggestive of altered paracrine interactions between ductal epithelial cells and the surrounding mesenchyme during Wolffian duct differentiation due to lowered testosterone production.",

         "Angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (a/LCI) is used to obtain quantitative, depth-resolved nuclear morphology measurements. We compare the average diameter and texture of cell nuclei in rat esophagus epithelial tissue to grading criteria established in a previous a/LCI study to prospectively grade neoplastic progression. We exploit the depth resolution of a/LCI to exclusively examine the basal layer of the epithelium, approximately 50 to 100 microm beneath the tissue surface, without the need for exogenous contrast agents, tissue sectioning, or fixation. The results of two studies are presented that compare the performance of two a/LCI modalities. Overall, the combined studies show 91% sensitivity and 97% specificity for detecting dysplasia, using histopathology as the standard. In addition, the studies enable the effects of dietary chemopreventive agents, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and curcumin, to be assessed by observing modulation in the incidence of neoplastic change. We demonstrate that a/LCI is highly effective for monitoring neoplastic change and can be applied to assessing the efficacy of chemopreventive agents in the rat esophagus.",

         "Rat Strain Effects of AT1 Receptor Activation on D1 Dopamine Receptors in Immortalized Renal Proximal Tubule Cells",
         "The dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems regulate blood pressure, in part, by affecting sodium transport in renal proximal tubules (RPTs). We have reported that activation of a D1-like receptor decreases AT1 receptor expression in the mouse kidney and in immortalized RPT cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The current studies were designed to test the hypothesis that activation of the AT1 receptor can also regulate the D1 receptor in RPT cells, and this regulation is aberrant in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Long-term (24 hours) stimulation of RPT cells with angiotensin II, via AT1 receptors increased total cellular D1 receptor protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in WKY but not in SHR cells. Short-term stimulation (15 minutes) with angiotensin II did not affect total cellular D1 receptor protein in either rat strain. However, in the short-term experiments, angiotensin II decreased cell surface membrane D1 receptor protein in WKY but not in SHR cells. D1 and AT1 receptors colocalized (confocal microscopy) and their coimmunoprecipitation was greater in WKY than in SHRs. However, AT1/D1 receptor coimmunoprecipitation was decreased by angiotensin II (10−8M/24 hours) to a similar extent in WKY (−22±8%) and SHRs (−22±12%). In summary, these studies show that AT1 and D1 receptors interact differently in RPT cells from WKY and SHRs. It is possible that an angiotensin II-mediated increase in D1 receptors and dissociation of AT1 from D1 receptors serve to counter regulate the long-term action of angiotensin II in WKY rats; different effects are seen in SHRs.",

         "Contribution of high p34cdc2 kinase activity to premature chromosome condensation of injected somatic cell nuclei in rat oocytes.",
         "The present study was undertaken to clarify the relationship between the p34cdc2 kinase activity of in vitro-aged or enucleated rat oocytes and the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) of microinjected cumulus cell nuclei. Wistar rat oocytes were placed in vitro up to 120 min after the animal was killed. The p34cdc2 kinase activity of the oocytes decreased in a time-dependent manner. The incidence of PCC was higher when nuclear injection into intact oocytes was completed in 15-45 min rather than 46-120 min. When rat oocytes were enucleated for subsequent nuclear injection, the p34cdc2 kinase activity transiently increased soon after enucleation but drastically decreased after 30 min. Removal of the cytoplasm instead of the meta-phase-plate did not affect the p34cdc2 kinase activity even after 60 min. PCC occurred in intact and cytoplasm-removed oocytes but not in enucleated oocytes. In contrast, oocytes from BDF1 mice exhibited a p34cdc2 kinase level twice that of rat oocytes and supported PCC despite enucleation. The p34cdc2 kinase level of intact rat oocytes was reduced to the equivalent level of aged (120 min) or enucleated (+60 min) oocytes by a 45 min treatment with roscovitine, an inhibitor of p34cdc2 kinase. None of the roscovitine-treated oocytes supported PCC while half of the control oocytes did. When rat oocytes were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, delayed inactivation of the p34cdc2 kinase was observed in the MG132-treated oocytes. A significantly higher proportion of the MG132-treated oocytes supported PCC when compared with the control oocytes. Moreover, a higher proportion of MG132-treated and enucleated oocytes carried two pseudo-pronuclei after cumulus cell injection and developed to the two-cell stage when compared with the enucleated oocytes at the telophase-II stage. These results suggest that the decreased level of p34cdc2 kinase activity in aged or enucleated rat oocytes is responsible for their inability to support PCC of microinjected donor cell nuclei and that inhibition of p34cdc2 kinase inactivation by chemicals such as MG132 is in part effective for rat oocytes to promote PCC and further development.",

         "OBJECTIVES\nTo compare the agreement between microbroth dilution and agar dilution for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Campylobacter jejuni.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUtilizing commercially prepared antimicrobial panels, microbroth dilution was compared with agar dilution for determining antimicrobial susceptibility in C. jejuni isolates. To assess the performance of both techniques for ampicillin, 190 C. jejuni isolates from dairy cattle were utilized. A group of 172 C. jejuni isolates from dairy sources were used to compare the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur results indicate that microbroth dilution and agar dilution agree within +/-1 log2 dilution for 86.7% of the isolates tested. Ciprofloxacin had the highest level of agreement for isolates tested by both techniques, resulting in a kappa of 0.886 and 97.1% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution. The least agreement was observed in determining the susceptibility of isolates to ampicillin and erythromycin (82.1 and 79.7% agreement +/-1 log2 dilution). However, kappa statistics were considered to have good agreement for these antimicrobials. There were no significant differences in the summary statistics for any of the five antimicrobials evaluated for the isolates analysed by the percentage of resistant isolates, MIC50, MIC75 or MIC90 beyond +/-1 log2 dilution. There was no association in the classification of resistance by the testing methods employed. We also demonstrated that the quality control strain of C. jejuni ATCC 33650 performed in a consistent manner for both agar dilution and microbroth dilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMicrobroth dilution may be an acceptable alternative to agar dilution for determining susceptibility of C. jejuni in research or surveillance where flow of samples, labour efficiency and cost may restrict the use of agar dilution.",

         "Numerical Periodic Normalization for Codim 1 Bifurcations of Limit Cycles",
         "Explicit computational formulas for the coefficients of the periodic normal forms for all codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles in generic autonomous ODEs are derived. They include second-order coefficients for the fold (limit point) bifurcation, as well as third-order coefficients for the flip (period-doubling) and Neimark--Sacker (torus) bifurcations. The formulas are independent of the dimension of the phase space and involve solutions of certain boundary-value problems on the interval [0,T], where T is the period of the critical cycle, as well as multilinear functions from the Taylor expansion of the right-hand sides near the cycle. The formulas allow us to distinguish between sub- and supercritical bifurcations, in agreement with earlier asymptotic expansions of the bifurcating solutions. Our formulation makes it possible to use robust numerical boundary-value algorithms based on orthogonal collocation, rather than shooting techniques, which greatly expands its applicability. The actual implementation is described in detail. We include three numerical examples, in which codim 2 singularities are detected along branches of codim 1 bifurcations of limit cycles as zeros of the periodic normal form coefficients.",

         "Tungiasis is a parasitic skin disease widespread in resource-poor urban and rural communities in Brazil. Inhabitants of an urban slum in Northeast Brazil were examined for the presence of tungiasis lesions and followed-up twice a week for a period of three weeks. Each time the number, stages, and topographic localization of lesions were recorded on a documentation sheet. The infestation rate (number of newly embedded sand fleas per individual and day) remained stable during the observation period. The infestation rate was significantly related to the intensity of infestation (total number of lesions present) (rho = 0.70, p < 0.0001) and the proportion of viable lesions (rho = 0.28, p < 0.0001). The results indicate that in an endemic area the infestation intensity and the proportion of viable lesions can be used as a proxy to assess the exposure of individuals at risk for tungiasis. Persistently high infestation rates during the transmission season favour the use of prevention measures against invading sand fleas (such as a repellent) rather than a drug to kill already embedded parasites.",

         "With the burgeoning immunological data in the scientific literature, scientists must increasingly rely on Internet resources to inform and enhance their work. Here we provide a brief overview of the adaptive immune response and summaries of immunoinformatics resources, emphasizing those with Web interfaces. These resources include searchable databases of epitopes and immune-related molecules, and analysis tools for T cell and B cell epitope prediction, vaccine design, and protein structure comparisons. There is an agreeable synergy between the growing collections in immune-related databases and the growing sophistication of analysis software; the databases provide the foundation for developing predictive computational tools, which in turn enable more rapid identification of immune responses to populate the databases. Collectively, these resources contribute to improved understanding of immune responses and escape, and evolution of pathogens under immune pressure. The public health implications are vast, including designing vaccines, understanding autoimmune diseases, and defining the correlates of immune protection.",

         "The Potassium Channel KAT1 Is Activated by Plant and Animal 14-3-3 Proteins*",
         "14-3-3 proteins modulate the plant inward rectifier K+ channel KAT1 heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Injection of recombinant plant 14-3-3 proteins into oocytes shifted the activation curve of KAT1 by +11 mV and increased the τon. KAT1 was also modulated by 14-3-3 proteins of Xenopus oocytes. Titration of the endogenous 14-3-3 proteins by injection of the peptide Raf 621p resulted in a strong decrease in KAT1 current (∼70% at –150 mV). The mutation K56E performed on plant protein 14-3-3 in a highly conserved recognition site prevented channel activation. Because the maximal conductance of KAT1 was unaffected by 14-3-3, we can exclude that they act by increasing the number of channels, thus ruling out any effect of these proteins on channel trafficking and/or insertion into the oocyte membrane. 14-3-3 proteins also increased KAT1 current in inside-out patches, suggesting a direct interaction with the channel. Direct interaction was confirmed by overlay experiments with radioactive 14-3-3 on oocyte membranes expressing KAT1.",

         "Competitive recruitment of the periplasmic translocation portal TolB by a natively disordered domain of colicin E9",
         "The natively disordered N-terminal 83-aa translocation (T) domain of E group nuclease colicins recruits OmpF to a colicin-receptor complex in the outer membrane (OM) as well as TolB in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, the latter triggering translocation of the toxin across the OM. We have identified the 16-residue TolB binding epitope in the natively disordered T-domain of the nuclease colicin E9 (ColE9) and solved the crystal structure of the complex. ColE9 folds into a distorted hairpin within a canyon of the six-bladed β-propeller of TolB, using two tryptophans to bolt the toxin to the canyon floor and numerous intramolecular hydrogen bonds to stabilize the bound conformation. This mode of binding enables colicin side chains to hydrogen-bond TolB residues in and around the channel that runs through the β-propeller and that constitutes the binding site of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (Pal). Pal is a globular binding partner of TolB, and their association is known to be important for OM integrity. The structure is therefore consistent with translocation models wherein the colicin disrupts the TolB–Pal complex causing local instability of the OM as a prelude to toxin import. Intriguingly, Ca2+ ions, which bind within the β-propeller channel and switch the surface electrostatics from negative to positive, are needed for the negatively charged T-domain to bind TolB with an affinity equivalent to that of Pal and competitively displace it. Our study demonstrates that natively disordered proteins can compete with globular proteins for binding to folded scaffolds but that this can require cofactors such as metal ions to offset unfavorable interactions.",

         "Cyclophosphamide (CY) is a cytostatic agent that produces systemic toxicity especially on cells with high proliferative capacity, while polysaccharides from Angelica sinensis (AP) have been shown to increase the turnover of gastrointestinal mucosal and hemopoietic stem cells. It is not known whether AP has an effect on CY-induced cytotoxicity on bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we assessed the protective actions of AP on CY-induced leukopenia and proliferative arrest in the gastroduodenal mucosa in mice. Subcutaneous injection of CY (200 mg/kg) provoked dramatic decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count and number of blood vessels and proliferating cells in both the gastric and duodenal mucosae. Subcutaneous injection of AP significantly promoted the recovery from leukopenia and increased number of blood vessels and proliferating cells in both the gastric and duodenal tissues. Western blotting revealed that CY significantly down-regulated the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), c-Myc and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in gastric mucosae but had no effect on epidermal growth factor (EGF) expression. AP also reversed the dampening effect of CY on VEGF expression in the gastric mucosa. These data suggest that AP is a cytoprotective agent which can protect against the cytotoxicity of CY on hematopoietic and gastrointestinal tissues when the polysaccharide is co-administered with CY in cancer patients during treatment regimen.",

         "Cellular oxalate, widely distributed in many plants, is implicated to play important roles in various functions and is also known to affect food qualities adversely in fruits and vegetables. How oxalate is regulated in plants is currently not well understood. Glycolate oxidase (GLO) has long been considered as an important player in oxalate accumulation in plants. To gain further insight into the biochemical and molecular mechanisms, the possible roles of GLO in the process were studied. Drastically different levels of oxalate could be achieved by treating rice with various nitrogen forms (nitrate versus ammonium). While nitrate stimulated oxalate accumulation, ammonium reduced its level. Such treatments resulted in similar pattern changes for some other related organic acids, such as glycolate, oxaloacetate, and malate. By feeding plants with exogenous glycolate it was possible almost completely to restore the ammonium-decreased oxalate level. Under the two treatments few differences were observed for GLO mRNA levels, protein levels, and in vitro activities. Both K(m) for glycolate/glyoxylate and K(i) for oxalate remained almost the same for GLO purified from either nitrate- or ammonium-fed leaves. A further in vivo study, with transgenic plants carrying an estradiol-inducible GLO antisense gene, showed that, while the estradiol-induced antisense expression remarkably reduced both GLO protein levels and activities, oxalate levels were not significantly altered in the estradiol-treated transgenic plants. Taken together, it is suggested that oxalate accumulation and regulation is independent of GLO in rice leaves.",

         "Poly‐γ‐glutamate (PGA), a natural polymer, is synthesized by several bacteria (all Gram‐positive), one archaea and one eukaryote. PGA has diverse biochemical properties, enabling it to play different roles, depending on the organism and its environment. Indeed, PGA allows bacteria to survive at high salt concentrations and may also be involved in virulence. The minimal gene sets required for PGA synthesis were recently defined. There are currently two nomenclatures depending on the PGA final status: cap, for ‘capsule’, when PGA is surface associated or pgs, for ‘polyglutamate synthase’, when PGA is released. The minimal gene sets contain four genes termed cap or pgs B, C, A and E. The PGA synthesis complex is membrane‐anchored and uses glutamate and ATP as substrates. Schematically, the reaction may be divided into two steps, PGA synthesis and PGA transport through the membrane. PGA synthesis depends primarily on CapB‐CapC (or PgsB‐PgsC), whereas PGA transport requires the presence, or the addition, of CapA‐CapE (or PgsAA‐PgsE). The synthesis complex is probably responsible for the stereochemical specificity of PGA composition. Finally, PGA may be anchored to the bacterial surface or released. An additional enzyme is involved in this reaction: either CapD, a γ‐glutamyl‐transpeptidase that catalyses anchorage of the PGA, or PgsS, a hydrolase that facilitates release. The anchoring of PGA to the bacterial surface is important for virulence. All cap genes are therefore potential targets for inhibitors specifically blocking PGA synthesis or anchorage.",

         "In this study, three strains of Trypanosoma cruzi were isolated at the same time and in the same endemic region in Mexico from a human patient with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (RyC-H); vector (Triatoma barberi) (RyC-V); and rodent reservoir (Peromyscus peromyscus) (RyC-R). The three strains were characterized by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, random amplified polymorphic DNA, and by pathological profiles in experimental animals (biodemes). Based on the analysis of genetic markers the three parasite strains were typed as belonging to T. cruzi I major group, discrete typing unit 1. The pathological profile of RyC-H and RyC-V strains indicated medium virulence and low mortality and, accordingly, the strains should be considered as belonging to biodeme Type III. On the other hand, the parasites from RyC-R strain induced more severe inflammatory processes and high mortality (> 40%) and were considered as belonging to biodeme Type II. The relationship between genotypes and biological characteristics in T. cruzi strains is still debated and not clearly understood. An expert committee recommended in 1999 that Biodeme Type III would correspond to T. cruzi I group, whereas Biodeme Type II, to T. cruzi II group. Our findings suggest that, at least for Mexican isolates, this correlation does not stand and that biological characteristics such as pathogenicity and virulence could be determined by factors different from those identified in the genotypic characterization.",

         "Phospholipase C-type beta2 (PLCbeta2) is expressed in a subset of cells within mammalian taste buds. This enzyme is involved in the transduction of sweet, bitter, and umami stimuli and thus is believed to be a marker for gustatory sensory receptor cells. We have developed transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the PLCbeta2 promoter to enable one to identify these cells and record their physiological activity in living preparations. Expression of GFP (especially in lines with more than one copy integrated) is strong enough to be detected in intact tissue preparations using epifluorescence microscopy. By immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that the overwhelming majority of cells expressing GFP are those that endogenously express PLCbeta2.

         "The self‐controlled case series method was developed to investigate associations between acute outcomes and transient exposures, using only data on cases, that is, on individuals who have experienced the outcome of interest. Inference is within individuals, and hence fixed covariates effects are implicitly controlled for within a proportional incidence framework. We describe the origins, assumptions, limitations, and uses of the method. The rationale for the model and the derivation of the likelihood are explained in detail using a worked example on vaccine safety. Code for fitting the model in the statistical package STATA is described. Two further vaccine safety data sets are used to illustrate a range of modelling issues and extensions of the basic model. Some brief pointers on the design of case series studies are provided. The data sets, STATA code, and further implementation details in SAS, GENSTAT and GLIM are available from an associated website.

         "Semantic Web (SW), commonly regarded as the next generation of the Web, is an emerging vision of the new Web from the Knowledge Representation and the Web communities. To realize this vision, a series of techniques has been proposed. Semantic Web Ontology Langauge (OWL) and its extension Semantic Web rule Language (SWRL) and Semantic Web Logic Language (SWRL-FOL) are some of the most important outputs from the SW activities. However the existing reasoning and consistency checking tools for those languages are primitive. This paper proposes using the existing formal modelling tool, in particular Alloy, to provide an automatic reasoning service for the Semantic Web ontology family languages (OWL/SWRL/SWRL-FOL).",

         "To better elucidate the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(165) in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance, we generated stably transfected human STS cell lines with VEGF(165) to study the effect of VEGF(165) on STS cells in vitro and the effect of culture medium from these cells on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing xenografts of transfected cell lines were used to assess the effect of VEGF overexpression and the effect of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2 inhibition on STS growth, metastasis, and response to doxorubicin. VEGF(165)-transfected xenografts formed highly vascular tumors with shorter latency, accelerated growth, enhanced chemoresistance, and increased incidence of pulmonary metastases. Blockade of VEGFR2 signaling using DC101 anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody enhanced doxorubicin chemoresponse; this combined biochemotherapy inhibited tumor growth and decreased pulmonary metastases without overt toxicity. Combined therapy reduced microvessel counts while increasing vessel maturation index. VEGF overexpression did not affect on the sarcoma cells per se; however, conditioned medium from VEGF transfectants caused increased endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance. Addition of DC101 induced endothelial cell sensitivity to doxorubicin and suppressed the activity of matrix metalloproteinases secreted by endothelial cells. We therefore conclude that VEGF is a critical determinant of STS growth and metastasis and that STS chemoresistance, in our model, is a process induced by the interplay between STS cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells. STS growth and metastasis can be interrupted by combined low-dose doxorubicin and anti-VEGFR2, a strategy that attacks STS-associated endothelial cells. In the future, such therapeutic approaches may be useful in treating STS before the development of clinically apparent metastases.",

         "In case‐control association studies unobserved population stratification may act as a confounder, leading to an increased number of false positive results. Methods accounting for population structure by using additional genetic markers broadly follow one of two concepts: Genomic Control (GC) and Structured Association (SA). While extending existing methods of Structured Association we show that it is necessary to incorporate phenotypic information when inferring population structure, otherwise a systematic bias is introduced. Moreover, for moderate population stratification a Wald test statistic should be preferred as a Structured Association test statistic in comparison to a likelihood ratio test. The introduced extensions are compared to existing methods of Structured Association, as well as to Genomic Control, in a simulation study which is based on realistic situations of large case‐control studies with moderate population stratification. A disadvantage of Genomic Control turns out to be the large variation in estimating the variance inflation factor, as well as the power loss if population structure increases. We come to the overall conclusion that Structured Association, if applied correctly, is superior to Genomic Control, at least in the case of simple population structure as simulated here.",

         "ABSTRACT NK cells are key effectors of innate immunity and host survival during cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Innate murine CMV (MCMV) resistance in MA/My mice requires Ly49H/m157-independent H-2k-linked NK cell control. Here we show that replacement of MA/My H-2k with C57L H-2b susceptibility genes led to a remarkable loss of innate virus immunity, though NK gamma interferon was induced in H-2b and H-2k strains shortly after infection. Thus, H-2b genes expressed in C57L or MA/My.L-H2b are sufficient in alerting NK cells to intrusion but fail to support NK restraint of viral infection. In addition, novel H-2 recombinant strains were produced and utilized in a further refinement of a critical genetic interval controlling innate H-2k-linked MCMV resistance. Importantly, this analysis excluded the gene interval from Kk class I through class II. The responsible gene(s) therefore resides in an interval spanning Dk class Ia and more-distal major histocompatibility complex (MHC) nonclassical class Ib genes. Recently, the NK activation receptor Ly49P and MHC class I Dk proteins were genetically implicated in MCMV resistance, in part because Ly49P-expressing reporter T cells could specifically bind Dk molecules on MCMV-infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). However, as we found that H-2k innate resistance differs in the C57L or MA/My backgrounds and because MCMV very efficiently downregulates H-2k class I proteins in L929 cells and primary MEFs shortly after infection, a Ly49P/Dk model should not fully explain H-2k-linked MCMV resistance.",

         "Decay-accelerating factor (CD55) is a complement regulatory protein, which is expressed by most cells to protect them from complement-mediated attack. CD55 also binds CD97, an EGF-TM7 receptor constitutively expressed on granulocytes and monocytes and rapidly up-regulated on T and B cells upon activation. Early results suggested that CD55 could further enhance T cell proliferation induced by phorbol ester treatment. The present study demonstrates that coengagement of CD55, using either cross-linking mAbs or its natural ligand CD97, and CD3 results in enhanced proliferation of human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells, expression of the activation markers CD69 and CD25, and secretion of IL-10 and GM-CSF. Recently, an increase in T cell responsiveness in CD55−/− mice was shown to be mediated by a lack of complement regulation. In this study, we show that direct stimulation of CD55 on CD4+ T cells with CD97 can modulate T cell activation but does not interfere with CD55-mediated complement regulation. Our results support a multifaceted role for CD55 in human T cell activation, constituting a further link between innate and adaptive immunity.",

         "Analysis of molecular data sets has provided new insights into higher-level relationships of living Eutheria, including the recognition of Afrotheria as a novel taxon. This offers an opportunity to take a fresh look at the evolution of organ systems, including some that are little used in traditional systematics. In the present study, we attempted a reconstruction of the evolution of characters associated with placentation, the fetal membranes and the female reproductive tract. The evolutionary history of 21 characters has been traced, based on a current hypothesis of eutherian relationships, by applying the computer program MacClade. Accordingly, the analysis provides a first comprehensive interpretation of the stem species pattern of Eutheria. Of particular note, this pattern includes an endotheliochorial chorioallantoic placenta. The reconstructed pattern of Eutheria does not change in the basal nodes of the group. Thus, no character transformations occur on the stem lineages of Laurasiatheria or Euarchontoglires, and even Afrotheria has mostly plesiomorphic character conditions. However, two character transformations occur on the common stem lineage of Afrotheria and its sister taxon Xenarthra, i.e., amniogenesis by cavitation instead of folding and the precocial state of the newborn. In addition, we recognized one character transformation on the stem lineage of Afrotheria, i.e., the occurrence of a four-lobed allantoic sac. Thus, contrary to previous assertions, it is possible to identify morphological characters that could be synapomorphic for this novel taxon.",

         "In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells leads to the acute onset of hyperglycemia. The nonobese diabetic mouse model of human T1DM reveals that T cells capable of inducing diabetes can escape normal central tolerance, and can cause T1DM if left unchecked. However, several regulatory T cell subsets can temper autoaggressive T cells, although it remains undetermined when and how, and by which subset, homeostatic control of diabetogenic T cells is normally achieved in vivo. Using a cotransfer model, we find that NKT cells efficiently dampen the action of diabetogenic CD4+ T cells, and do so in an indirect manner by modifying the host environment. Moreover, the NKT cell-containing population modifies the host via production of IFN-γ that is necessary for driving the inhibition of diabetogenic T cells in vivo.",

         "Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disease caused by mutations in the PKD1 gene. This adult-onset disease results in the accumulation of destructive kidney cysts, leading to progressive loss of renal function and eventually to renal failure. A need for kidney transplantation and dialysis are common outcomes. There are currently no treatment options to prevent or delay the disease onset. Although the PKD1 gene was identified more than a decade ago, the development of treatment strategies has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the function of polycystin-1 (PC1), the protein encoded by the PKD1 gene (1, 2). Work by Shillingford et al. (3) in this issue of PNAS now identifies a new function of PC1, which immediately suggests a possibility for future treatment options.\n\nPC1 is a very large integral membrane protein with a much smaller C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Previous work had implicated this tail in numerous signaling events, but their relevance to ADPKD had remained largely unclear. Shillingford et al. (3) now report that the PC1 tail interacts with a very interesting player by the name of tuberin, the product of the TSC2 gene. Tuberin mutations lead to the complex disease tuberous sclerosis (TSC), which is ≈10 times less common than ADPKD. Three earlier observations had already suggested that tuberin and PC1 could be functionally linked. First, in addition to benign tumors in multiple organs, TSC patients also exhibit kidney cysts. Second, the TSC2 gene is located only a handful of base pairs away from the PKD1 gene. A subset of patients has larger chromosomal deletions that affect both the TSC2 and the PKD1 genes at the same time. These patients suffer from very severe, early onset polycystic kidney disease. Third, previous results using tuberin null cells had suggested that tuberin may play … \n\n*Correspondence should be addressed: Department of Anatomy, University of California School of Medicine, Genentech Hall, Room N212B, Box 2140, 600 16th Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.

         "In the northern hemisphere, there is compelling evidence for climate-related advances of spring events, but no such long-term biological time series exist for the southern hemisphere. We have studied a unique data set of dates of first arrival and laying of first eggs over a 55-year period for the entire community of Antarctic seabirds in East Antarctica. The records over this long period show a general unexpected tendency toward later arrival and laying, an inverse trend to those observed in the northern hemisphere. Overall, species now arrive at their colonies 9.1 days later, on average, and lay eggs an average of 2.1 days later than in the early 1950s. Furthermore, these delays are linked to a decrease in sea ice extent that has occurred in eastern Antarctica, which underlies the contrasted effects of global climate change on species in Antarctica.",

         "Classical cadherins such as E‐, P‐ and N‐cadherin are transmembrane proteins that mediate cell–cell adhesion, and are important in embryogenesis, maintenance of tissue integrity and cancer. Proteolytic shedding of the extracellular domain results in the generation of soluble E‐, P‐ or N‐cadherin ectodomains. Circulating soluble E‐ and P‐cadherin have been described in the serum, and elevated levels were detected in cancer patients when compared with healthy persons. Here we report the presence of soluble N‐cadherin, a 90‐kD protein fragment, in the serum of both healthy persons and cancer patients, using a direct ELISA and immunoprecipitation. A correlation was found between prostate specific antigen and soluble N‐cadherin, and significantly elevated levels were detected in prostate cancer follow‐up patients. The N‐cadherin protein is neo‐expressed by carcinomas of the prostate, and is responsible for epithelial to fibroblastic transition. This is reflected by the higher concentrations of soluble N‐cadherin in prostate cancer patients than in healthy persons. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

         "Long-range cooperative interactions modulate dimerization in SARS 3CLpro.",
         "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by the human coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The main viral protease, SARS 3CLpro, is a validated target for the development of antiviral therapies. Since the enzyme is a homodimer and the individual monomers are inactive, two approaches are being used to develop inhibitors: enzyme activity inhibitors that target the active site and dimerization inhibitors. Dimerization inhibitors are usually targeted to the dimerization interface and need to compete with the attractive forces between subunits to be effective. In this paper, we show that the dimerization of SARS 3CLpro is also under allosteric control and that additional and energetically more favorable target sites away from the dimerization interface may also lead to subunit dissociation. We previously identified a cluster of conserved serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) located adjacent to the active site of 3CLpro that could effectively be targeted to inactivate the protease [Bacha, U et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 4906-4912]. Mutation of any of these serine residues to alanine had a debilitating effect on the catalytic activity of 3CLpro. In particular, the mutation of Ser147, which does not make any contact with the opposing subunit and is located approximately 9 A away from the dimer interface, totally inhibited dimerization and resulted in a complete loss of enzymatic activity. The finding that residues away from the dimer interface are able to control dimerization defines alternative targets for the design of dimerization inhibitors.",

         "Recent studies show that plant organ positioning may be mediated by localized concentrations of the plant hormone auxin. Auxin patterning in the shoot apical meristem is in turn brought about by the subcellular polar distribution of the putative auxin efflux mediator, PIN1. However, the question of what signals determine PIN1 polarization and how this gives rise to regular patterns of auxin concentration remains unknown. Here we address these questions by using mathematical modeling combined with confocal imaging. We propose a model that is based on the assumption that auxin influences the polarization of its own efflux within the meristem epidermis. We show that such a model is sufficient to create regular spatial patterns of auxin concentration on systems with static and dynamic cellular connectivities, the latter governed by a mechanical model. We also optimize parameter values for the PIN1 dynamics by using a detailed auxin transport model, for which parameter values are taken from experimental estimates, together with a template consisting of cell and wall compartments as well as PIN1 concentrations quantitatively extracted from confocal data. The model shows how polarized transport can drive the formation of regular patterns.",

         "The YLDL Sequence within Sendai Virus M Protein Is Critical for Budding of Virus-Like Particles and Interacts with Alix/AIP1 Independently of C Protein",
         "ABSTRACT For many enveloped viruses, cellular multivesicular body (MVB) sorting machinery has been reported to be utilized for efficient viral budding. Matrix and Gag proteins have been shown to contain one or two L-domain motifs (PPxY, PT/SAP, YPDL, and FPIV), some of which interact specifically with host cellular proteins involved in MVB sorting, which are recruited to the viral budding site. However, for many enveloped viruses, L-domain motifs have not yet been identified and the involvement of MVB sorting machinery in viral budding is still unknown. Here we show that both Sendai virus (SeV) matrix protein M and accessory protein C contribute to virus budding by physically interacting with Alix/AIP1. A YLDL sequence within the M protein showed L-domain activity, and its specific interaction with the N terminus of Alix/AIP1(1-211) was important for the budding of virus-like particles (VLPs) of M protein. In addition, M-VLP budding was inhibited by the overexpression of some deletion mutant forms of Alix/AIP1 and depletion of endogenous Alix/AIP1 with specific small interfering RNAs. The YLDL sequence was not replaceable by other L-domain motifs, such as PPxY and PT/SAP, and even YPxL. C protein was also able to physically interact with the N terminus of Alix/AIP1(212-357) and enhanced M-VLP budding independently of M-Alix/AIP1 interaction, although it was not released from the transfected cells itself. Our results suggest that the interaction of multiple viral proteins with Alix/AIP1 may enhance the efficiency of the utilization of cellular MVB sorting machinery for efficient SeV budding.",

         "The aggregation of ataxin-3 is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, which is characterized by the formation of intraneuronal aggregates. However, the mechanism of aggregation is currently not well understood. Ataxin-3 consists of a folded Josephin domain followed by two ubiquitin-interacting motifs and a C-terminal polyglutamine tract, which in the non-pathological form is less than 45 residues in length. We demonstrate that ataxin-3 with 64 glutamines (at(Q64)) undergoes a two-stage aggregation. The first stage involves formation of SDS-soluble aggregates, and the second stage results in formation of SDS-insoluble aggregates via the poly(Q) region. Both these first and second stage aggregates display typical amyloid-like characteristics. Under the same conditions at(Q15) and at(QHQ) undergo a single step aggregation event resulting in SDS-soluble aggregates, which does not involve the polyglutamine tract. These aggregates do not convert to the SDS-insoluble form. These observations demonstrate that ataxin-3 has an inherent capacity to aggregate through its non-polyglutamine domains. However, the presence of a pathological length polyglutamine tract introduces an additional step resulting in formation of a highly stable amyloid-like aggregate.",

         "Phosphorylation of β-Catenin by Cyclic AMP-dependent Protein Kinase*",
         "β-Catenin is a signaling molecule that promotes cell proliferation by the induction of gene transcription through the activation of T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription factors. The canonical mechanism of the regulation of β-catenin involves its phosphorylation by casein kinase 1 at the Ser-45 site and by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) at the Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 sites. This phosphorylation targets β-catenin to ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome system. Mitogenic factors promote β-catenin signaling through the inhibition of GSK3, resulting in reduced β-catenin phosphorylation, its stabilization, and subsequent accumulation in the nucleus, where it stimulates TCF/LEF-dependent gene transcription. In the present study, we have shown that (i) β-catenin can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in vitro and in intact cells at two novel sites, Ser-552 and Ser-675; (ii) phosphorylation by PKA promotes the transcriptional activity (TCF/LEF transactivation) ofβ-catenin; (iii) mutation of Ser-675 attenuates the promoting effect of PKA; (iv) phosphorylation by PKA does not affect the GSK3-dependent phosphorylation ofβ-catenin, its stability, or intracellular localization; and (v) phosphorylation at the Ser-675 site promotes the binding of β-catenin to its transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein. In conclusion, this study identifies a novel, noncanonical mechanism of modulation of β-catenin signaling through direct phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA, promoting its interaction with CREB-binding protein.",

         "Transcription Regulation of ompF and ompC by a Single Transcription Factor, OmpR*",
         "The ompF and ompC genes of Escherichia coli are reciprocally regulated by a single transcription factor, phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P), depending upon medium osmolarity. This regulation involves activation of ompF and its repression with concomitant activation of ompC. This occurs through OmpR-P binding to four (F1, F2, F3, and F4) and three (C1, C2, and C3) sites located upstream of the ompF and ompC promoters, respectively, through a novel mechanism. Here we show that there is a distinct OmpR-P binding hierarchy within F1, F2, and F3 sites as well as within C1, C2, and C3 sites. Each of these sites contains two tandem 10-bp OmpR-P-binding subsites, a-site and b-site (from 5′ to 3′ direction). OmpR-P has higher affinity to the downstream b-site than to the upstream a-site in each case. Six OmpR-P molecules bind to F and C sites two-by-two in a discontinuous “galloping” manner. We propose that this tight hierarchical binding of a transcription factor, OmpR, allows distinct stepwise regulation of ompF and ompC transcription, which minimizes their overlapping expression upon changes in the medium osmolarity to achieve the reciprocal expression of ompF and ompC.",

         "Transportin Is a Major Nuclear Import Receptor for c-Fos",
         "c-Fos, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, is rapidly imported into the nucleus after translation. We established an in vitro system using digitonin-permeabilized cells to analyze nuclear import of c-Fos in detail. Two import receptors of the importin β superfamily, importin β itself and transportin, promote import of c-Fos in vitro. Under conditions where importin β-dependent transport was blocked, c-Fos still accumulated in the nucleus in the presence of cytosol. Inhibition of the transportin-dependent pathway, in contrast, abolished import of c-Fos. Furthermore, c-Fos mutants that interact with transportin but not with importin β were efficiently imported in the presence of cytosol. Hence, transportin appears to be the predominant import receptor for c-Fos. A detailed biochemical characterization revealed that the interaction of transportin with c-Fos is distinct from the interaction with its established import cargoes, the M9 sequence of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 or the nuclear localization sequence of some basic proteins. Likewise, the binding sites on importin β for its classic import cargo and for c-Fos can be separated. In summary, c-Fos employs a novel mode of receptor-cargo interaction. Hence, transportin may be as versatile as importin β in recognizing different nuclear import cargoes.",

         "Immature oocytes benefit from nutrient modification of the follicular environment by the surrounding cumulus mass. However, the oxygen concentration that the oocyte may be exposed to could be lower than the antral follicular concentration due to the metabolism of surrounding cumulus cells. Using metabolic data previously determined, we have developed a mathematical model of O(2) diffusion across the bovine and murine cumulus-oocyte complex. From this we have determined that across a physiological range of external pO(2), less than 0.25% and 0.5% O(2) is removed by cumulus cells within the bovine and murine cumulus-oocyte complex respectively. Our model differs from others as it: incorporates a term that allows for nonlinear variation of the oxygen consumption rate with oxygen concentration; considers two regions (oocyte and cumulus) sharing a common boundary, both of which consume oxygen at different non linear rates. Cumulus cells therefore remove little O(2), thus sparing this essential gas for the oocyte, which is dependent on ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation.",

         "A Comprehensive Structure–Function Analysis of Arabidopsis SNI1 Defines Essential Regions and Transcriptional Repressor Activity[W][OA]",
         "The expression of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants involves the upregulation of many Pathogenesis-Related (PR) genes, which work in concert to confer resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens. Because SAR is a costly process, SAR-associated transcription must be tightly regulated. Arabidopsis thaliana SNI1 (for Suppressor of NPR1, Inducible) is a negative regulator of SAR required to dampen the basal expression of PR genes. Whole genome transcriptional profiling showed that in the sni1 mutant, Nonexpresser of PR genes (NPR1)–dependent benzothiadiazole S-methylester–responsive genes were specifically derepressed. Interestingly, SNI1 also repressed transcription when expressed in yeast, suggesting that it functions as an active transcriptional repressor through a highly conserved mechanism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that histone modification may be involved in SNI1-mediated repression. Sequence comparison with orthologs in other plant species and a saturating NAAIRS-scanning mutagenesis of SNI1 identified regions in SNI1 that are required for its activity. The structural similarity of SNI1 to Armadillo repeat proteins implies that SNI1 may form a scaffold for interaction with proteins that modulate transcription.",

         "New complexities in the genetics of stuttering: significant sex-specific linkage signals.",
         "Stuttering is a speech disorder long recognized to have a genetic component. Recent linkage studies mapped a susceptibility locus for stuttering to chromosome 12 in 46 highly inbred families ascertained in Pakistan. We report here on linkage studies in 100 families of European descent ascertained in the United States, Sweden, and Israel. These families included 252 individuals exhibiting persistent stuttering, 45 individuals classified as recovered from stuttering, and 19 individuals too young to classify. Primary analyses identified moderate evidence for linkage of the broader diagnosis of \"ever stuttered\" (including both persistent and recovered stuttering) on chromosome 9 (LOD = 2.3 at 60 cM) and of the narrower diagnosis of persistent stuttering on chromosome 15 (LOD = 1.95 at 23 cM). In contrast, sex-specific evidence for linkage on chromosome 7 at 153 cM in the male-only data subset (LOD = 2.99) and on chromosome 21 at 34 cM in the female-only data subset (LOD = 4.5) met genomewide criteria for significance. Secondary analyses revealed a significant increase in the evidence for linkage on chromosome 12, conditional on the evidence for linkage at chromosome 7, with the location of the increased signal congruent with the previously reported signal in families ascertained in Pakistan. In addition, a region on chromosome 2 (193 cM) showed a significant increase in the evidence for linkage conditional on either chromosome 9 (positive) or chromosome 7 (negative); this chromosome 2 region has been implicated elsewhere in studies on autism, with increased evidence for linkage observed when the sample is restricted to those with delayed onset of phrase speech. Our results support the hypothesis that the genetic component to stuttering has significant sex effects.",

         "The ability to switch between multiple tasks is central to flexible behavior. Although switching between tasks is readily accomplished, a well established consequence of task switching (TS) is behavioral slowing. The source of this switch cost and the contribution of cognitive control to its resolution remain highly controversial. Here, we tested whether proactive interference arising from memory places fundamental constraints on flexible performance, and whether prefrontal control processes contribute to overcoming these constraints. Event-related functional MRI indexed neural responses during TS. The contributions of cognitive control and interference were made theoretically explicit in a computational model of task performance. Model estimates of two levels of proactive interference, \"conceptual conflict\" and \"response conflict,\" produced distinct preparation-related profiles. Left ventrolateral prefrontal cortical activation paralleled model estimates of conceptual conflict, dissociating from that in left inferior parietal cortex, which paralleled model estimates of response conflict.

         "Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) Establishes Latent Infection in a Different Population of Ganglionic Neurons than HSV-1: Role of Latency-Associated Transcripts",
         "ABSTRACT Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 cause very similar acute infections but differ in their abilities to reactivate from trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. To investigate differences in patterns of viral infection, we colabeled murine sensory ganglia for evidence of HSV infection and for the sensory neuron marker A5 or KH10. During acute infection, 7 to 10% of HSV-1 or HSV-2 antigen-positive neurons were A5 positive and 13 to 16% were KH10 positive, suggesting that both viruses reach each type of neuron in a manner proportional to their representation in uninfected ganglia. In murine trigeminal ganglia harvested during HSV latency, 25% of HSV-1 latency-associated transcript (LAT)- and 4% of HSV-2 LAT-expressing neurons were A5 positive, while 12% of HSV-1 LAT- and 42% of HSV-2 LAT-expressing neurons were KH10 positive. A similar difference was observed in murine dorsal root ganglia. These differences could not be attributed to differences in LAT expression levels in A5- versus KH10-positive neurons. Thus, HSV-1 demonstrated a preference for the establishment of latency in A5-positive neurons, while HSV-2 demonstrated a preference for the establishment of latency in KH10-positive neurons. A chimeric HSV-2 mutant that expresses the HSV-1 LAT exhibited an HSV-1 phenotype, preferentially establishing latency in A5-positive neurons. These data imply that the HSV-1 and HSV-2 LAT regions influence the ability of virus to establish latency in different neuronal subtypes. That the same chimeric virus has a characteristic HSV-1 reactivation phenotype further suggests that LAT-influenced establishment of latency in specific neuronal subtypes could be an important part of the mechanism by which LAT influences viral reactivation phenotypes.",

         "Cellular scaling rules for rodent brains",
         "How do cell number and size determine brain size? Here, we show that, in the order Rodentia, increased size of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and remaining areas across six species is achieved through greater numbers of neurons of larger size, and much greater numbers of nonneuronal cells of roughly invariant size, such that the ratio between total neuronal and nonneuronal mass remains constant across species. Although relative cerebellar size remains stable among rodents, the number of cerebellar neurons increases with brain size more rapidly than in the cortex, such that the cerebellar fraction of total brain neurons increases with brain size. In contrast, although the relative cortical size increases with total brain size, the cortical fraction of total brain neurons remains constant. We propose that the faster increase in average neuronal size in the cerebral cortex than in the cerebellum as these structures gain neurons and the rapidly increasing glial numbers that generate glial mass to match total neuronal mass at a fixed glia/neuron total mass ratio are fundamental cellular constraints that lead to the relative expansion of cerebral cortical volume across species.",

         "The current model for pathogenesis of inhalation anthrax indicates that the uptake and fate of Bacillus anthracis spores in alveolar macrophages are critical to the infection process. We have employed primary macrophages, which are more efficient for spore uptake than the macrophage‐like cell line RAW264.7, to investigate spore uptake and survival. We found that at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 5, greater than 80% of the spores of the Sterne strain containing only the pXO1 plasmid were internalized within 1 h. Within 4 h post infection, viability of internalized Sterne spores decreased to approximately 40%. Intracellular vegetative bacteria represented less than 1% of the total spore inoculum throughout the course of infection suggesting effective killing of germinated spores and/or vegetative bacteria. The Sterne spores trafficked quickly to phagolysosomes as indicated by colocalization with lysosome‐associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1). Expression of a dominant‐negative Rab7 that blocked lysosome fusion enhanced Sterne spore survival. Addition of d‐alanine to the infection resulted in 75% inhibition of spore germination and increased survival of internalized spores of the Sterne strain and a pathogenic strain containing both the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids. Inhibition was reversed by the addition of l‐alanine, which resumed spore germination and subsequent spore killing. Our data indicate that B. anthracis spores germinate in and are subsequently killed by primary macrophages.",

         "Selective Removal of DNA from Dead Cells of Mixed Bacterial Communities by Use of Ethidium Monoazide",
         "ABSTRACT The distinction between viable and dead bacterial cells poses a major challenge in microbial diagnostics. Due to the persistence of DNA in the environment after cells have lost viability, DNA-based quantification methods overestimate the number of viable cells in mixed populations or even lead to false-positive results in the absence of viable cells. On the other hand, RNA-based diagnostic methods, which circumvent this problem, are technically demanding and suffer from some drawbacks. A promising and easy-to-use alternative utilizing the DNA-intercalating dye ethidium monoazide bromide (EMA) was published recently. This chemical is known to penetrate only into “dead” cells with compromised cell membrane integrity. Subsequent photoinduced cross-linking was reported to inhibit PCR amplification of DNA from dead cells. We provide evidence here that in addition to inhibition of amplification, most of the DNA from dead cells is actually lost during the DNA extraction procedure, probably together with cell debris which goes into the pellet fraction. Exposure of bacteria to increasing stress and higher proportions of dead cells in defined populations led to increasing loss of genomic DNA. Experiments were performed using Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as model pathogens and using real-time PCR for their quantification. Results showed that EMA treatment of mixed populations of these two species provides a valuable tool for selective removal of DNA of nonviable cells by using conventional extraction protocols. Furthermore, we provide evidence that prior to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, EMA treatment of a mature mixed-population drinking-water biofilm containing a substantial proportion of dead cells can result in community fingerprints dramatically different from those for an untreated biofilm. The interpretation of such fingerprints can have important implications in the field of microbial ecology.",

         "A Thiamin-bound, Pre-decarboxylation Reaction Intermediate Analogue in the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 Subunit Induces Large Scale Disorder-to-Order Transformations in the Enzyme and Reveals Novel Structural Features in the Covalently Bound Adduct*",
         "The crystal structure of the E1 component from the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDHc) has been determined with phosphonolactylthiamin diphosphate (PLThDP) in its active site. PLThDP serves as a structural and electrostatic analogue of the natural intermediate α-lactylthiamin diphosphate (LThDP), in which the carboxylate from the natural substrate pyruvate is replaced by a phosphonate group. This represents the first example of an experimentally determined, three-dimensional structure of a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme containing a covalently bound, pre-decarboxylation reaction intermediate analogue and should serve as a model for the corresponding intermediates in other ThDP-dependent decarboxylases. Regarding the PDHc-specific reaction, the presence of PLThDP induces large scale conformational changes in the enzyme. In conjunction with the E1-PLThDP and E1-ThDP structures, analysis of a H407A E1-PLThDP variant structure shows that an interaction between His-407 and PLThDP is essential for stabilization of two loop regions in the active site that are otherwise disordered in the absence of intermediate analogue. This ordering completes formation of the active site and creates a new ordered surface likely involved in interactions with the lipoyl domains of E2s within the PDHc complex. The tetrahedral intermediate analogue is tightly held in the active site through direct hydrogen bonds to residues His-407, Tyr-599, and His-640 and reveals a new, enzyme-induced, strain-related feature that appears to aid in the decarboxylation process. This feature is almost certainly present in all ThDP-dependent decarboxylases; thus its inclusion in our understanding of general thiamin catalysis is important.",

         "The impact of plant-based factors on the population dynamics of mammalian herbivores has been the subject of much debate in ecology, but the role of antiherbivore defences in grasses has received relatively little attention. Silica has been proposed as the primary defence in grasses and is thought to lead to increased abrasiveness of foliage so deterring feeding, as well as reducing foliage digestibility and herbivore performance. However, at present there is little direct experimental evidence to support these ideas. In this study, we tested the effects of manipulating silica levels on the abrasiveness of grasses and on the feeding preference and growth performance of field voles, specialist grass-feeding herbivores. Elevated silica levels did increase the abrasiveness of grasses and deterred feeding by voles. We also demonstrated, for the first time, that silica reduced the growth rates of both juvenile and mature female voles by reducing the nitrogen they could absorb from the foliage. Furthermore, we found that vole feeding leads to increased levels of silica in leaves, suggesting a dynamic feedback between grasses and their herbivores. We propose that silica induction due to vole grazing reduces vole performance and hence could contribute to cyclic dynamics in vole populations.",

As a paradigmatic example, we consider networks of coupled phase oscillators and explicitly study their long-term stationary response to temporally constant driving. For a given driving condition, measuring the phase differences and the collective frequency reveals information about how the units are interconnected. Sufficiently many repetitions for different driving conditions yield the entire network connectivity (the absence or presence of each connection) from measuring the response dynamics only. For sparsely connected networks, we obtain good predictions of the actual connectivity even for formally underdetermined problems.",

         "Patterns of Regional Brain Hypometabolism Associated with Knowledge of Semantic Features and Categories in Alzheimer's Disease",
         "The study of semantic memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised important questions about the representation of conceptual knowledge in the human brain. It is still unknown whether semantic memory impairments are caused by localized damage to specialized regions or by diffuse damage to distributed representations within nonspecialized brain areas. To our knowledge, there have been no direct correlations of neuroimaging of in vivo brain function in AD with performance on tasks differentially addressing visual and functional knowledge of living and nonliving concepts. We used a semantic verification task and resting 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in a group of mild to moderate AD patients to investigate this issue. The four task conditions required semantic knowledge of (1) visual, (2) functional properties of living objects, and (3) visual or (4) functional properties of nonliving objects. Visual property verification of living objects was significantly correlated with left posterior fusiform gyrus metabolism (Brodmann's area [BA] 37/19). Effects of visual and functional property verification for non-living objects largely overlapped in the left anterior temporal (BA 38/20) and bilateral premotor areas (BA 6), with the visual condition extending more into left lateral precentral areas. There were no associations with functional property verification for living concepts. Our results provide strong support for anatomically separable representations of living and nonliving concepts, as well as visual feature knowledge of living objects, and against distributed accounts of semantic memory that view visual and functional features of living and nonliving objects as distributed across a common set of brain areas.",
