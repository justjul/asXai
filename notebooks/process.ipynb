         "  Neural decoding is an important method in cognitive neuroscience that aims to\ndecode brain representations from recorded neural activity using a multivariate\nmachine learning model. The THINGS initiative provides a large EEG dataset of\n46 subjects watching rapidly shown images. Here, we test the feasibility of\nusing this method for decoding high-level object features using recent deep\nlearning models.

Neural decoding is an important method in cognitive neuro-\nscience that aims to decode brain representations from recorded neural\nactivity using a multivariate machine learning model. The THINGS ini-\ntiative [11] provides a large EEG dataset of 46 subjects watching rapidly\nshown images. Here, we test the feasibility of using this method for de-\ncoding high-level object features using recent deep learning models. We\ncreate a derivative dataset from this of living vs non-living entities test\n15 different deep learning models with 5 different architectures and com-\npare to a SOTA linear model. We show that the linear model is not able\nto solve the decoding task, while almost all the deep learning models are\nsuccessful, suggesting that in some cases non-linear models are needed to\ndecode neural representations. We also run a comparative study of the\nmodels’ performance on individual object categories, and suggest how\nartificial neural networks can be used to study brain activity.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.2**\nKeywords: EEG · Neural Decoding · Deep Learning · THINGS · Bench-\nmark\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThe human brain is still the most advanced information-processing entity we\nknow of, with incredible efficiency, efficacy and adaptability. However, the de-\ntails of how information is represented and processed in the brain at the algorith-\nmic level are elusive to us. Furthering this understanding holds great potential\nfor understanding intelligence at a deeper level. Neural decoding is a somewhat\nrecent technique for studying neural representations. It consists of applying a\nmachine learning (ML) model to recordings of brain activity, to decode repre-\nsentations in the brain [18]. Here decoding is finding dissociations in the neural\nactivity associated with different stimuli or conditions. When dissociation is suc-\ncessful, that neural activity is taken to contain relevant information about the\nconditional difference, thereby giving scientists a clue on what information is\npresent where and when in coganitive processing. Neural decoding, using mul-\ntivariate statistical or ML approaches, has gained popularity among cognitive\nneuroscientists as a tool to analyse their experimental data, replacing, to some\ndegree, the traditional approach of inferential statistics on univariate measures\nof individual voxels or electrodes using generalised linear models [8]. Recently,\nneural decoding has given great insight into among others vision science [23],\nface processing [14]. The imaging technique focused on in this paper is elec-\ntroencephalography (EEG). EEG offers a non-invasive way to measure neural\nactivity with a very high sampling rate at the cost of a lower spatial resolution\nwhen compared to other popular imaging techniques. Whereas high accuracy in\ntraditional neural decoding is not essential - if decoding happens reliably it is\ntaken as such, other fields using similar techniques have great interest in creating\nmodels able to efficiently learn associations between brain patterns in EEG and\nbehaviour, intention or cognitive state [23]. Among these fields is the study of\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCI), where the aim is to allow interactions with a\ncomputer using only neural recordings. Medical fields are also starting to rely on\nusing computational analysis of brain activity to diagnose neurological diseases\nsuch as depression[27] and dementia [15]. Other fields that also benefit from\nhigh-performing models on neural data are affective computing [16], and stim-\nulus reconstruction [3]. Therefore, developing models that can effectively learn\nthe patterns in EEG signals is highly important. Even for traditional cognitive\nneural decoding, simpler models might not be able to successfully find some\nassociations that only show in highly nonlinear relationships [10].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nDeep learning (DL) models have, especially in the last 10 years, shown their\npower in modelling nonlinear relationships. Even so much that they have got-\nten to human or superhuman levels in some cognitively relevant tasks. This has\ncaused interest from cognitive neuroscientists to figure out how to utilise these\ntools best in their work [6]. The main requirement for these models to work has\nbeen collecting enough high-quality data for training. Especially, scaling into\nvery large models has required scaling the sample size as well. A few large EEG\ndatasets exist in different domains, for example diagnosis [7] and BCI [13]. None\nof these holds as much potential for insight into cognition as the THINGS ini-\ntiative [12]. THINGS contain 12 or more naturalistic images of 1,854 different\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nobjects with plenty of semantic details described for each object category in-\ncluding wordnet relationships and human-rated high-level categories. Crucially,\nrecordings of humans watching these images now exist both for fMRI, MEG and\nEEG [9]. The EEG dataset by [11] has 46 subjects all viewing 22,248 images,\nresulting in 1,023,408 total trials, which we believe warrants an interest from the\ncomputational cognitive neuroscience community. Despite this, not much work\nhas been done in trying to utilise the large dataset for bigger DL models. This is\nwhy we, in this work, aim to take the first steps in exploring and benchmarking\na simple task derived from this dataset using different popular DL models and\ncomparing them to the best linear modelling techniques.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n2 Related works\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThe THINGS EEG dataset presents a unique challenge in decoding because of\nits experimental constraints. To practically let each subject watch 22,248 images,\nthey are shown in rapid succession. Specifically 50 ms stimulus time and 50 ms\noff duty. That means ten images are shown per second. This presumably limits\nthe amount of information processing the subject is doing per image, which\nis part of why this work needs to be benchmarked. An important constraint\nthen is the short time window of the relevant signal. Crucially, this makes a\nfrequency representation of the data less feasible. Band power representation\nhas otherwise shown to be greatly suited for DL on EEG [30]. Therefore, we\nare tasked with analysing the untransformed time representation, which limits\nthe possible comparisons for this work. The closest work in this area, to our\nbest knowledge, comes from the BCI community, where benchmarking model\nperformance is important. The MOABB project [13] lays out a variety of BCI\ndatasets of various sizes and collects them for standardised testing. Interestingly,\naccording to their leaderboards, almost all BCI applications are best solved using\na linear decoder pipeline. It is worth noting that BCI tasks are often chosen\nspecifically because they are easily solved by a linear model. For example, a\nbinary motor imagery task often consists of imagining moving either the right or\nthe left arm. This should create a clear lateralisation in the signal, which is easily\npicked up by a linear model. We, therefore, should include a linear modelling\napproach in our study to compare deep learning models.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nRecently, the THINGS MEG dataset was used for real-time image reconstruc-\ntion [3]. While MEG and EEG measure very similar signals, the MEG THINGS\ndataset did not have the ten images per second setup, making comparisons less\neasy. They used a convolutional model with residual connections introduced in\n[4] to get a 7X improvement to a linear baseline model, although their task in-\ncluded the original 1854 object categories, which is different to the task used\nhere.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nTo keep in line with more traditional decoding paradigms, we introduce a novel\nbinary classification task created from a subset of the EEG THINGS dataset.\nWe want the task to be cognitively relevant and non-trivial to solve while still\nbeing possible. We chose the task of separating living vs nonliving things - specif-\nically objects that are easily manipulated by hands. It is an established finding\nthat this high-level categorisation can be separated by visual stimulation using\nfMRI [21] and EEG [1]. We chose 429 object concepts (of the original 1854)\nthat fit into these two categories from the human-labeled categories provided by\nthe original THINGS paper [12]. Specifically, we used the ”Top-down Category\n(manual selection)”. The categories chosen for handleable objects are: ”tool”,\n”sports equipment”, ”musical instrument”, ”electronic device”, and ”weapon”,\nand for living the categories are: ”animal”, ”animal, bird”, ”animal, insect”, ”an-\nimal, food”, ”body part”. Note that ”animal, food” refers to animals that could\nbe eaten (e.g. ”eel”) but the picture is of a living animal, not food. It is worth\nnoting that while the overall classes are completely balanced, the object cate-\ngories used to construct them are not. This is not a purposeful construction, but\na byproduct of the human-labeled categories of naturalistic images. An analysis\nof object-level performance is provided later. With 12 repetitions of each label\nand 46 subjects, that gives the task 236,808 total number of trials. We judge this\nto be adequate to start testing DL models with reasonably large parameter sets.\nWe also created a single-subject task, in which each subject”s data was treated\nseparately, resulting in 5,148 samples per subject.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n3.2 Preprocessing\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWe kept preprocessing minimal [5]. The original data was referenced inconsis-\ntently in some subjects, we fixed this by re-referencing the data to the Cz elec-\ntrode and included all other 63 electrodes. We applied a 1-40 Hz bandpass filter\nand downsampled the data to a 100 Hz sampling frequency. We then applied a\nbaseline from 200 ms before stimulus onset and up to stimulus onset. Then only\nthe 500 ms post stimulus onset was considered, resulting in a sample shape of 63\nelectrodes and 50 time points. The data was z-score normalised at each channel\nfor each trial.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\n3.3 Training\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nAll models were trained using the same protocol, without any specialised hyper-\nparameter tuning. The batch size was kept at 128 the optimiser was a standard\nstochastic gradient descent with a momentum of 0.9. The learning rate was on\na cyclic schedule [20], which makes it gradually decrease with ”warm restarts”.\nWe kept the cycle parameters of the original paper, making starting cycle length\nT0 = 15, and the cycle multiplier Tmult = 2. This learning rate scheduling lets\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nus avoid tuning the learning rate for each model. We trained the models for 945\nepochs, giving us six warm restarts during training. For the single-subject task,\nwe only trained models for 460 epochs, giving five restarts. In the original EEG\nTHINGS paper, they ended their recording session with an inbuilt test split,\nshowing a repeat of one of the twelve images in each category. We chose not to\nuse this, as there could be potential cofounders with only using the last trials as\nthe test set. Instead, we split the set randomly and tested on 20% of the original\ndata. All models are trained on one NVIDIA V100 graphics processing unit with\n32 GB of memory, which was enough to contain the full dataset and models.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\n3.4 Models\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nSix different model architectures were tested for this experiment, representing\nwidely different modelling approaches for sequences: convolution, graph, recur-\nrent and transformer. Representing convolutional models, we chose the popular\nEEGNet [19]. A compact and efficient way to handle time series, convolutional\nkernels are applied across the signal and summarised by max-pooling layers.\nThen representing graph neural networks, we chose the dynamic graph con-\nvolutional neural network (DGCNN) [25]. Graph neural networks encode the\nelectrode montage as a graph structure, modelling the electrode relationships\nas a non-euclidian space. Since EEG electrodes do not inherently have a graph\nstructure, they let the adjacency matrix be a learnable part of the network,\nhence the name ”dynamic”. The DGCNN uses spectral graph convolution to\ntransmit information across the graph. Then, for a recurrent network, we chose\nthe long-short term memory (LSTM) architecture for EEG described in the book\n[29]. The LSTM works by establishing consecutive recurrent layers with gating\nfor long and short-term relationships across the time series. Recently, the trans-\nformer model has shown its prowess in NLP, but it is not clear how it works\non more standard time-series data structures. We decided to test the standard\ntransformer model as described in [28] using the attention mechanism to find\nrelationships across the time series. Then, because the vanilla transformer is\nnot standard for time series analysis, we also included the EEG Conformer [26],\nwhich combines a convolutional block to encode the time series to make it bet-\nter suited for the transformer model. The implementations for all these models\nwere based on the TorchEEGEMO [30] and Braindecode PyTorch module [24],\nto ensure these were as standardised as possible.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nOnly small changes were made in how dropout was handled. Three versions\nof each model were created to allow for diversity in model size. One ”small”,\none ”medium” and one ”large” for each model type chosen. With the size of the\ntraining set as a guide (∼ 200, 000 samples), we aimed for the small model to be\nunderparameterised (≪100,000), the medium-sized model to have a similar size\n(∼ 100, 000) and the large model to be overparameterised (> 100, 000). Some\nmodels differed from this, to avoid straying too far away from the original design.\nThe number of trainable parameters for each model can be seen in Table 1 and\ndetails of the implementation can be seen in the provided code. The dropout rate\nwas changed for each model size, so that small models had a dropout of 0.25,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nmedium-sized models had 0.5 and large models had 0.75, to prevent overfitting.\nAdditionally, weight decay regularisation was applied equally to all models, with\nλ = 0.001. For the single-subject task, only small models were used and a dropout\nrate of 0.5 was used.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFor a linear baseline model, we chose the Common Spatial Patterns + Lin-\near Discriminant Analysis (CSP + LDA) [17]. This method is an adapted LDA\nmodel specifically for EEG event-related (ERP) signals. CSP + LDA works by\nidentifying separatable spatial patterns as orthogonal waveforms in the EEG\nsignal and treating them as features for an LDA. This is the method that per-\nformed best in most of the MOABB [13] leaderboards of BCI tasks, and typically\nworks very well in clearly separatable conditions, see for example [2]. All models\nwere first tested on a trivial task on the THINGS dataset with the same prepro-\ncessing, data structure and training method and achieved > 95% accuracy. The\ntrivial task was a binary classification task of identifying the subject of the trial.\nThis shows that all models can learn by using this methodology.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.2**\nTable 1.

A notable exception is the DGCNN, which reached 57.88%\nin recall, which is marginally higher.

The vanilla transformer was by far the worst\nperforming DL model, not able to reach above chance level. Crucially, the CSP\n+ LDA linear model did also not reach more than the chance level. For further\nanalysis, we identify the best-performing models as the EEGNet, DGCNN and\nthe Conformer.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nTraining speed The small versions of EEGNET, LSTM and DGCNN all\ntrained in under 3 hours. The medium-sized LSTM and the medium and large\nversions of DGCNN also cleared this mark, showing how scaling the graph neural\nnetwork did not slow performance. EEGNET did slow down with bigger parame-\nter sets, and the LSTM also slowed down with its large version. All these models\nwere somewhat shallow, with only a few layers, which might explain how they\nwere able to train this fast. It might also show, that reaching a breaking point in\ntoo many parameters per layer slows down training immensely. The transformer\nmodel was the slowest to train (>14h), with no improvement with smaller pa-\nrameter sets. This is likely due to its need to find relationships across the time\nseries, resulting in poor scaling in the sequence dimension. The Conformer was\nin between these at 6h 25m, showing how introducing convolutional kernels to\nthe transformer model helps both with efficacy and efficiency.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n4.2 Single-subject task\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nTable 3 reports the average best performance across subjects on the single-\nsubject task.

We see that the best-performing\nmodel is the EEGNet reaching 61% in accuracy, precision and recall. The Con-\nformer model is close in performance, hovering around 60.5% in all three mea-\nsures. Neither the transformer nor the linear CSP + LDA was able to learn the\ndissociation, getting around the chance level in all measures. The LSTM and the\nDGCNN achieved similar or worse performance, compared to the cross-subject\ntask, suggesting that the smaller dataset made it harder to generalise to the test\nset effectively. Fig. 1. shows the average performance during training. Note that\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.4**r== 0.3**\nFig. 1.

Here\nwe see the propensity of all models to overfit on the smaller dataset.

We start with a comparative analysis of all object categories, see\nFig. 2 for visualisation. Since multiple models achieved similar performances, it is\nworth investigating if they are classifying the same image categories with similar\nsuccess. Here we use the cross-subject models and stick to the small version of\neach model, that achieved 57.1% accuracy.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nObject labels Looking at Fig. 2. we see that all models follow roughly the\nsame trend of which object categories that were labelled correctly. Especially the\nConformer and EEGNet show very similar behaviour on the test set, whereas\nDGCNN shows the same overall distribution but with higher variance for in-\ndividual object labels. In order to verify that these indeed have similar perfor-\nmance, we run a paired t-test (428 degrees of freedom) on the accuracies for each\nobject. None of these showed a significant difference: Conformer vs EEGNet -\nt = 1.116 p = 0.265 , EEGNet vs DGCNN - t = 1.175 p = 0.241, Conformer\nvs DGCNN - t = 0.794 p = 0.428. We also note that there is some difference\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\namong object labels. Best-performing objects have around 70% accuracy, while\nthe worst-performing labels sit under 30%. We note that there seem to be a few\nobjects that give a particularly bad performance, as seen in the small dent on\nthe far left side of each subplot in Fig 2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.3**\nTable 4.

It is im-\nportant to note that these categories are not balanced, meaning some categories\nlike ”animal” hold over 100 different objects, whereas ”people” only contain\nfive. In Table 4, we report the average accuracy of the small version of EEGNet,\nDGCNN and the Conformer on the test set, stratified by these top-down cate-\ngories. First, looking at the ”alive” categories, it is clear that especially the two\ncategories ”body part” (46.7%) and ”animal, insect” (42%) are underperforming\ncompared to the others. While one could argue they are underrepresented in the\ndata, as both have a low number of objects (34 and 17), we also see that the\n”people” category has the highest accuracy (56%) among the ”Alive” categories,\nwhile being the worst represented (5). Another possible explanation is these im-\nages have different image compositions or low-level image features (e.g. contrast,\ncolours) to the other categories, resulting in highly different EEG signals, see Fig\n3. for example images. This explanation would require a more detailed analysis\nof the original images. The last explanation is the cognitive one, where insects\nand individual body parts are simply not reliably treated as ”living” in the same\nway that other animals and people are. Again more analysis would be needed to\nconfirm or deny this hypothesis in later work.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFig. 3. Example images of the best and worst performing object categories, taken from\nthe THINGS initiative available at: https://osf.io/jum2f/.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWe then look at the ”Non-living” categories and we notice two main things.\nFirstly, the distribution of accuracies is much more even, all of them hovering\naround 60%, maybe with the exception of ”electronic devices” sitting at 64.3%.\nThis even spread could simply be from the much more balanced number of ob-\njects in each category, reducing the risk of model bias towards specific object\ncategories. It could also reflect a higher degree of similarity in the neural rep-\nresentation in these categories than seen for living objects. The second thing to\nnotice is that the average accuracy among ”non-living” is almost 10% higher\nthan that for ”alive” categories. We also see this reflected in Fig 3., where the\ntop five performing categories are ”non-living” and all worst performing five\ncategories are all labelled ”alive”. Possibly this shows that there was higher ho-\nmogeneity across the objects chosen as ”non-living” since these were specifically\npicked to be ”handleable” objects, that is objects one could interact with using\none’s hands for some purpose. Indeed, it has long been known that such affor-\ndances drive reliable motor cortex activation [22], which could be driving the\nhigher performance in these objects compared to animals. We provide possible\nnext steps in the Future Work section below.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n5 Discussion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nIn this work, we tested 5 different DL architectures and a popular linear model on\na binary classification task of separating living vs. non-living entities, which was\ncreated using the EEG THINGS dataset. Interestingly, the linear model did not\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nmanage to find the dissociation between these two conditions. Instead, every DL\nmodel, except the vanilla transformer, managed to achieve >56.5% accuracy on\nboth the cross-subject and the single-subject task, showing a reliable decoding\nresult. Firstly, this seems to demonstrate that in some decoding tasks applying a\nnonlinear model is necessary to find patterns between stimulus and brain activity.\nSecondly, we show here the feasibility of decoding high-level object features from\nrapidly shown images (10 hz), even though the signal might be overlapping\nbetween trials. We did not find that the specific model choice mattered greatly.\nVastly different architectures like the Conformer, recurrent and graph neural\nnetworks all achieved the same peak performance. Perhaps suggesting a cap in\npossible performance on this task around 57.10% accuracy. We leave it as an\nopen challenge for future work to achieve better results using the same setup.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWe also ran an analysis on the similarity of performance on different object\nlabels in the three best-performing models, EEGNet, DGCNN and Conformer.\nWe found that the differences between models were not significant, but also not\nidentical. Especially the convolutional neural network EEGNet and the convolu-\ntion+transformer architecture in the Conformer have similar performance. The\nEEGNet and the Conformer also performed best in single-subject tasks, where\nthe sample size was much lower. One interesting observation is then that the\nconvolutional filters seem to be an effective representation of EEG signals when\nthe number of samples is on the lower side. Even with the larger parameter (see\nTable 1) set of the Conformer (36,000) compared to the DGCNN (12,500) and\nLSTM (3,900), overfitting did not disrupt performance. Possibly, the convolu-\ntional filters act as an information bottleneck, squeezing the features through a\nsmaller parameter set and decreasing the risk of overfitting.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWe did only test this on a subset of the original full dataset, and on a single\nbinary classification task. However, this result is shown robustly across different\ndomains as an achievable task and the fact that the linear model was not able\nto solve it in this case seems to suggest the necessity to use deep models in\nsome circumstances. As discussed above the THINGS dataset presents a unique\nchallenge, as it is uncertain how much information is present in the EEG signal,\nwhen images are presented in such a rapid fashion. It is certain that having\noverlapping stimuli in the signal will decrease the signal-to-noise ratio for single\ntrials. This is compensated for, by having many more trials. Our results suggest\nthat DL models are well positioned to perform decoding tasks in this setting of\nmany trials of lower signal quality.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.5**\n5.1 Future Work and Conclusions\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nMuch future work is needed in this area. Here we chose to test different model\ntypes and sizes as the main independent variables. However, other choices would\nbe equally interesting to test. We suggest looking at different preprocessing pro-\ncedures like filtering, artefact removal and normalisation. Not much research\nhas been done on decoding the performance of deep learning models on EEG or\nMEG signals, which leads to relying mostly on conventions. We would also sug-\ngest trying to decode other high-level or low-level object features. The THINGS\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\ninitiative provides many different possible image labels, which could be used as\ntargets for decoding tasks.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nAnother important avenue for future research is to develop a better under-\nstanding of model behaviour. We ran a simple comparative study here, but much\nmore work is needed to understand how DL models represent and analyse EEG\nsignals. Our analysis of object labels showed that models had quite different per-\nformances on different top-down categories of objects. We saw how convolutional\nmodels were successful in our study. One could use visualisation techniques to\nunderstand what parts of the signal are driving the performance of the models.\nSimilarly, the DCGNN are learning a graph representation of the EEG electrode\nrelationships during training. We suggest that looking at this graph might give\ninsight into how the model has learned to represent the signal and hint at a\nfunctional connectome.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWhile this work replicated a well-known finding in the cognitive neuroscience\nliterature, that the animacy of seen objects can be decoded from brain signals,\nthis is an important step for incorporating DL techniques into the toolkit of cog-\nnitive neuroscience. Artificial neural networks hold much potential but need to\nbe explored more systematically in new and older settings, to test where they are\nuseful compared to traditional methods. Replicating known findings using new\nmethods is a reliable and necessary preliminary step to test the method’s overall\nutility. With the entrance of bigger and more complex datasets like the THINGS\ninitiative, using DL models to perform neural decoding in settings where linear\nmodels simply cannot capture the relationships is a likely next step for using\nfunctional neuroimaging to advance our knowledge of brain representations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.3**\n1.

         " Laurits Dixen, Stefan Heinrich, and Paolo Burelli   The human brain is still the most advanced information-processing entity we know of, with incredible efficiency, efficacy and adaptability. However, the de- tails of how information is represented and processed in the brain at the algorith- mic level are elusive to us. Furthering this understanding holds great potential for understanding intelligence at a deeper level. Neural decoding is a somewhat recent technique for studying neural representations. It consists of applying a machine learning (ML) model to recordings of brain activity, to decode repre- sentations in the brain [18]. Here decoding is finding dissociations in the neural activity associated with different stimuli or conditions. When dissociation is suc- cessful, that neural activity is taken to contain relevant information about the conditional difference, thereby giving scientists a clue on what information is present where and when in coganitive processing. Neural decoding, using mul- tivariate statistical or ML approaches, has gained popularity among cognitive neuroscientists as a tool to analyse their experimental data, replacing, to some degree, the traditional approach of inferential statistics on univariate measures of individual voxels or electrodes using generalised linear models [8]. Recently, neural decoding has given great insight into among others vision science [23], face processing [14]. The imaging technique focused on in this paper is elec- troencephalography (EEG). EEG offers a non-invasive way to measure neural activity with a very high sampling rate at the cost of a lower spatial resolution when compared to other popular imaging techniques. Whereas high accuracy in traditional neural decoding is not essential - if decoding happens reliably it is taken as such, other fields using similar techniques have great interest in creating models able to efficiently learn associations between brain patterns in EEG and behaviour, intention or cognitive state [23]. Among these fields is the study of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), where the aim is to allow interactions with a computer using only neural recordings. Medical fields are also starting to rely on using computational analysis of brain activity to diagnose neurological diseases such as depression[27] and dementia [15]. Other fields that also benefit from high-performing models on neural data are affective computing [16], and stim- ulus reconstruction [3]. Therefore, developing models that can effectively learn the patterns in EEG signals is highly important. Even for traditional cognitive neural decoding, simpler models might not be able to successfully find some associations that only show in highly nonlinear relationships [10].   Deep learning (DL) models have, especially in the last 10 years, shown their power in modelling nonlinear relationships. Even so much that they have got- ten to human or superhuman levels in some cognitively relevant tasks. This has caused interest from cognitive neuroscientists to figure out how to utilise these tools best in their work [6]. The main requirement for these models to work has been collecting enough high-quality data for training. Especially, scaling into very large models has required scaling the sample size as well. A few large EEG datasets exist in different domains, for example diagnosis [7] and BCI [13]. None of these holds as much potential for insight into cognition as the THINGS ini- tiative [12]. THINGS contain 12 or more naturalistic images of 1,854 different   objects with plenty of semantic details described for each object category in- cluding wordnet relationships and human-rated high-level categories. Crucially, recordings of humans watching these images now exist both for fMRI, MEG and EEG [9]. The EEG dataset by [11] has 46 subjects all viewing 22,248 images, resulting in 1,023,408 total trials, which we believe warrants an interest from the computational cognitive neuroscience community. Despite this, not much work has been done in trying to utilise the large dataset for bigger DL models. This is why we, in this work, aim to take the first steps in exploring and benchmarking a simple task derived from this dataset using different popular DL models and comparing them to the best linear modelling techniques.   2 Related works   The THINGS EEG dataset presents a unique challenge in decoding because of its experimental constraints. To practically let each subject watch 22,248 images, they are shown in rapid succession. Specifically 50 ms stimulus time and 50 ms off duty. That means ten images are shown per second. This presumably limits the amount of information processing the subject is doing per image, which is part of why this work needs to be benchmarked. An important constraint then is the short time window of the relevant signal. Crucially, this makes a frequency representation of the data less feasible. Band power representation has otherwise shown to be greatly suited for DL on EEG [30]. Therefore, we are tasked with analysing the untransformed time representation, which limits the possible comparisons for this work. The closest work in this area, to our best knowledge, comes from the BCI community, where benchmarking model performance is important. The MOABB project [13] lays out a variety of BCI datasets of various sizes and collects them for standardised testing. Interestingly, according to their leaderboards, almost all BCI applications are best solved using a linear decoder pipeline. It is worth noting that BCI tasks are often chosen specifically because they are easily solved by a linear model. For example, a binary motor imagery task often consists of imagining moving either the right or the left arm. This should create a clear lateralisation in the signal, which is easily picked up by a linear model. We, therefore, should include a linear modelling approach in our study to compare deep learning models.   Recently, the THINGS MEG dataset was used for real-time image reconstruc- tion [3]. While MEG and EEG measure very similar signals, the MEG THINGS dataset did not have the ten images per second setup, making comparisons less easy. They used a convolutional model with residual connections introduced in [4] to get a 7X improvement to a linear baseline model, although their task in- cluded the original 1854 object categories, which is different to the task used here.   To keep in line with more traditional decoding paradigms, we introduce a novel binary classification task created from a subset of the EEG THINGS dataset. We want the task to be cognitively relevant and non-trivial to solve while still being possible. We chose the task of separating living vs nonliving things - specif- ically objects that are easily manipulated by hands. It is an established finding that this high-level categorisation can be separated by visual stimulation using fMRI [21] and EEG [1]. We chose 429 object concepts (of the original 1854) that fit into these two categories from the human-labeled categories provided by the original THINGS paper [12]. Specifically, we used the ”Top-down Category (manual selection)”. The categories chosen for handleable objects are: ”tool”, ”sports equipment”, ”musical instrument”, ”electronic device”, and ”weapon”, and for living the categories are: ”animal”, ”animal, bird”, ”animal, insect”, ”an- imal, food”, ”body part”. Note that ”animal, food” refers to animals that could be eaten (e.g. ”eel”) but the picture is of a living animal, not food. It is worth noting that while the overall classes are completely balanced, the object cate- gories used to construct them are not. This is not a purposeful construction, but a byproduct of the human-labeled categories of naturalistic images. An analysis of object-level performance is provided later. With 12 repetitions of each label and 46 subjects, that gives the task 236,808 total number of trials. We judge this to be adequate to start testing DL models with reasonably large parameter sets. We also created a single-subject task, in which each subject”s data was treated separately, resulting in 5,148 samples per subject.   We kept preprocessing minimal [5]. The original data was referenced inconsis- tently in some subjects, we fixed this by re-referencing the data to the Cz elec- trode and included all other 63 electrodes. We applied a 1-40 Hz bandpass filter and downsampled the data to a 100 Hz sampling frequency. We then applied a baseline from 200 ms before stimulus onset and up to stimulus onset. Then only the 500 ms post stimulus onset was considered, resulting in a sample shape of 63 electrodes and 50 time points. The data was z-score normalised at each channel for each trial.   All models were trained using the same protocol, without any specialised hyper- parameter tuning. The batch size was kept at 128 the optimiser was a standard stochastic gradient descent with a momentum of 0.9. The learning rate was on a cyclic schedule [20], which makes it gradually decrease with ”warm restarts”. We kept the cycle parameters of the original paper, making starting cycle length T0 = 15, and the cycle multiplier Tmult = 2. This learning rate scheduling lets   us avoid tuning the learning rate for each model. We trained the models for 945 epochs, giving us six warm restarts during training. For the single-subject task, we only trained models for 460 epochs, giving five restarts. In the original EEG THINGS paper, they ended their recording session with an inbuilt test split, showing a repeat of one of the twelve images in each category. We chose not to use this, as there could be potential cofounders with only using the last trials as the test set. Instead, we split the set randomly and tested on 20% of the original data. All models are trained on one NVIDIA V100 graphics processing unit with 32 GB of memory, which was enough to contain the full dataset and models.   Six different model architectures were tested for this experiment, representing widely different modelling approaches for sequences: convolution, graph, recur- rent and transformer. Representing convolutional models, we chose the popular EEGNet [19]. A compact and efficient way to handle time series, convolutional kernels are applied across the signal and summarised by max-pooling layers. Then representing graph neural networks, we chose the dynamic graph con- volutional neural network (DGCNN) [25]. Graph neural networks encode the electrode montage as a graph structure, modelling the electrode relationships as a non-euclidian space. Since EEG electrodes do not inherently have a graph structure, they let the adjacency matrix be a learnable part of the network, hence the name ”dynamic”. The DGCNN uses spectral graph convolution to transmit information across the graph. Then, for a recurrent network, we chose the long-short term memory (LSTM) architecture for EEG described in the book [29]. The LSTM works by establishing consecutive recurrent layers with gating for long and short-term relationships across the time series. Recently, the trans- former model has shown its prowess in NLP, but it is not clear how it works on more standard time-series data structures. We decided to test the standard transformer model as described in [28] using the attention mechanism to find relationships across the time series. Then, because the vanilla transformer is not standard for time series analysis, we also included the EEG Conformer [26], which combines a convolutional block to encode the time series to make it bet- ter suited for the transformer model. The implementations for all these models were based on the TorchEEGEMO [30] and Braindecode PyTorch module [24], to ensure these were as standardised as possible.   Only small changes were made in how dropout was handled. Three versions of each model were created to allow for diversity in model size. One ”small”, one ”medium” and one ”large” for each model type chosen. With the size of the training set as a guide (∼ 200, 000 samples), we aimed for the small model to be underparameterised (≪100,000), the medium-sized model to have a similar size (∼ 100, 000) and the large model to be overparameterised (> 100, 000). Some models differed from this, to avoid straying too far away from the original design. The number of trainable parameters for each model can be seen in Table 1 and details of the implementation can be seen in the provided code. The dropout rate was changed for each model size, so that small models had a dropout of 0.25,   medium-sized models had 0.5 and large models had 0.75, to prevent overfitting. Additionally, weight decay regularisation was applied equally to all models, with λ = 0.001. For the single-subject task, only small models were used and a dropout rate of 0.5 was used.   For a linear baseline model, we chose the Common Spatial Patterns + Lin- ear Discriminant Analysis (CSP + LDA) [17]. This method is an adapted LDA model specifically for EEG event-related (ERP) signals. CSP + LDA works by identifying separatable spatial patterns as orthogonal waveforms in the EEG signal and treating them as features for an LDA. This is the method that per- formed best in most of the MOABB [13] leaderboards of BCI tasks, and typically works very well in clearly separatable conditions, see for example [2]. All models were first tested on a trivial task on the THINGS dataset with the same prepro- cessing, data structure and training method and achieved > 95% accuracy. The trivial task was a binary classification task of identifying the subject of the trial. This shows that all models can learn by using this methodology.   4.1 Cross-subject task   The accuracy, precision and recall of each model on the cross-subject task test set are reported in Table 2 alongside their training time. Since the learning rate scheduling cyclicly resets performance, the performance was measured as the top recorded accuracy between the last 5 epochs before a warm reset. We remind the reader, that the task is a binary classification and the chance level is at 0.5. Best results are highlighted with bold text.   We see that multiple models converged to a top performance measure of 57.10% accuracy. Both EEGNET, the Conformer and the DGCNN reached this mark or within 0.01% of it. Similarly, we see precision and recall around 57.15% in those same models, showing how there was no clear bias to either false pos- itives or negatives. A notable exception is the DGCNN, which reached 57.88% in recall, which is marginally higher. The LSTM reached a peak accuracy of   56.65%, making it almost as good. The vanilla transformer was by far the worst performing DL model, not able to reach above chance level. Crucially, the CSP + LDA linear model did also not reach more than the chance level. For further analysis, we identify the best-performing models as the EEGNet, DGCNN and the Conformer.   Training speed The small versions of EEGNET, LSTM and DGCNN all trained in under 3 hours. The medium-sized LSTM and the medium and large versions of DGCNN also cleared this mark, showing how scaling the graph neural network did not slow performance. EEGNET did slow down with bigger parame- ter sets, and the LSTM also slowed down with its large version. All these models were somewhat shallow, with only a few layers, which might explain how they were able to train this fast. It might also show, that reaching a breaking point in too many parameters per layer slows down training immensely. The transformer model was the slowest to train (>14h), with no improvement with smaller pa- rameter sets. This is likely due to its need to find relationships across the time series, resulting in poor scaling in the sequence dimension. The Conformer was in between these at 6h 25m, showing how introducing convolutional kernels to the transformer model helps both with efficacy and efficiency.   4.2 Single-subject task   Table 3 reports the average best performance across subjects on the single- subject task. We extract this by finding the best test performance during the   average of the last five epochs per restart cycle. We see that the best-performing model is the EEGNet reaching 61% in accuracy, precision and recall. The Con- former model is close in performance, hovering around 60.5% in all three mea- sures. Neither the transformer nor the linear CSP + LDA was able to learn the dissociation, getting around the chance level in all measures. The LSTM and the DGCNN achieved similar or worse performance, compared to the cross-subject task, suggesting that the smaller dataset made it harder to generalise to the test set effectively. Fig. 1. shows the average performance during training. Note that   the numbers in the table and the figure are not directly compatible as different subjects might reach the best performance during different training cycles. Here we see the propensity of all models to overfit on the smaller dataset. We can also see that EEGNet reaches peak performance much faster (100 epochs) whereas the Conformer needs 300 epochs of training. The LSTM and DGCNN were more susceptible to overfitting getting lower testing performance but higher training accuracy.   4.3 Comparative analysis on stimulus labels   Motivated by the above results of a somewhat stabilised performance across different model architectures, we ran a more detailed analysis of the individual object labels and the top-down labels, both provided in the original THINGS initiative work. We start with a comparative analysis of all object categories, see Fig. 2 for visualisation. Since multiple models achieved similar performances, it is worth investigating if they are classifying the same image categories with similar success. Here we use the cross-subject models and stick to the small version of each model, that achieved 57.1% accuracy.   Object labels Looking at Fig. 2. we see that all models follow roughly the same trend of which object categories that were labelled correctly. Especially the Conformer and EEGNet show very similar behaviour on the test set, whereas DGCNN shows the same overall distribution but with higher variance for in- dividual object labels. In order to verify that these indeed have similar perfor- mance, we run a paired t-test (428 degrees of freedom) on the accuracies for each object. None of these showed a significant difference: Conformer vs EEGNet - t = 1.116 p = 0.265 , EEGNet vs DGCNN - t = 1.175 p = 0.241, Conformer vs DGCNN - t = 0.794 p = 0.428. We also note that there is some difference   among object labels. Best-performing objects have around 70% accuracy, while the worst-performing labels sit under 30%. We note that there seem to be a few objects that give a particularly bad performance, as seen in the small dent on the far left side of each subplot in Fig 2.   Top-down categories Lastly, we look at the performance divided into the top- down categories, that we originally chose to make the animacy labels. It is im- portant to note that these categories are not balanced, meaning some categories like ”animal” hold over 100 different objects, whereas ”people” only contain five. In Table 4, we report the average accuracy of the small version of EEGNet, DGCNN and the Conformer on the test set, stratified by these top-down cate- gories. First, looking at the ”alive” categories, it is clear that especially the two categories ”body part” (46.7%) and ”animal, insect” (42%) are underperforming compared to the others. While one could argue they are underrepresented in the data, as both have a low number of objects (34 and 17), we also see that the ”people” category has the highest accuracy (56%) among the ”Alive” categories, while being the worst represented (5). Another possible explanation is these im- ages have different image compositions or low-level image features (e.g. contrast, colours) to the other categories, resulting in highly different EEG signals, see Fig 3. for example images. This explanation would require a more detailed analysis of the original images. The last explanation is the cognitive one, where insects and individual body parts are simply not reliably treated as ”living” in the same way that other animals and people are. Again more analysis would be needed to confirm or deny this hypothesis in later work.   We then look at the ”Non-living” categories and we notice two main things. Firstly, the distribution of accuracies is much more even, all of them hovering around 60%, maybe with the exception of ”electronic devices” sitting at 64.3%. This even spread could simply be from the much more balanced number of ob- jects in each category, reducing the risk of model bias towards specific object categories. It could also reflect a higher degree of similarity in the neural rep- resentation in these categories than seen for living objects. The second thing to notice is that the average accuracy among ”non-living” is almost 10% higher than that for ”alive” categories. We also see this reflected in Fig 3., where the top five performing categories are ”non-living” and all worst performing five categories are all labelled ”alive”. Possibly this shows that there was higher ho- mogeneity across the objects chosen as ”non-living” since these were specifically picked to be ”handleable” objects, that is objects one could interact with using one’s hands for some purpose. Indeed, it has long been known that such affor- dances drive reliable motor cortex activation [22], which could be driving the higher performance in these objects compared to animals. We provide possible next steps in the Future Work section below.   In this work, we tested 5 different DL architectures and a popular linear model on a binary classification task of separating living vs. non-living entities, which was created using the EEG THINGS dataset. Interestingly, the linear model did not   manage to find the dissociation between these two conditions. Instead, every DL model, except the vanilla transformer, managed to achieve >56.5% accuracy on both the cross-subject and the single-subject task, showing a reliable decoding result. Firstly, this seems to demonstrate that in some decoding tasks applying a nonlinear model is necessary to find patterns between stimulus and brain activity. Secondly, we show here the feasibility of decoding high-level object features from rapidly shown images (10 hz), even though the signal might be overlapping between trials. We did not find that the specific model choice mattered greatly. Vastly different architectures like the Conformer, recurrent and graph neural networks all achieved the same peak performance. Perhaps suggesting a cap in possible performance on this task around 57.10% accuracy. We leave it as an open challenge for future work to achieve better results using the same setup.   We also ran an analysis on the similarity of performance on different object labels in the three best-performing models, EEGNet, DGCNN and Conformer. We found that the differences between models were not significant, but also not identical. Especially the convolutional neural network EEGNet and the convolu- tion+transformer architecture in the Conformer have similar performance. The EEGNet and the Conformer also performed best in single-subject tasks, where the sample size was much lower. One interesting observation is then that the convolutional filters seem to be an effective representation of EEG signals when the number of samples is on the lower side. Even with the larger parameter (see Table 1) set of the Conformer (36,000) compared to the DGCNN (12,500) and LSTM (3,900), overfitting did not disrupt performance. Possibly, the convolu- tional filters act as an information bottleneck, squeezing the features through a smaller parameter set and decreasing the risk of overfitting.   We did only test this on a subset of the original full dataset, and on a single binary classification task. However, this result is shown robustly across different domains as an achievable task and the fact that the linear model was not able to solve it in this case seems to suggest the necessity to use deep models in some circumstances. As discussed above the THINGS dataset presents a unique challenge, as it is uncertain how much information is present in the EEG signal, when images are presented in such a rapid fashion. It is certain that having overlapping stimuli in the signal will decrease the signal-to-noise ratio for single trials. This is compensated for, by having many more trials. Our results suggest that DL models are well positioned to perform decoding tasks in this setting of many trials of lower signal quality.   5.1 Future Work and Conclusions   Much future work is needed in this area. Here we chose to test different model types and sizes as the main independent variables. However, other choices would be equally interesting to test. We suggest looking at different preprocessing pro- cedures like filtering, artefact removal and normalisation. Not much research has been done on decoding the performance of deep learning models on EEG or MEG signals, which leads to relying mostly on conventions. We would also sug- gest trying to decode other high-level or low-level object features. The THINGS   initiative provides many different possible image labels, which could be used as targets for decoding tasks.   Another important avenue for future research is to develop a better under- standing of model behaviour. We ran a simple comparative study here, but much more work is needed to understand how DL models represent and analyse EEG signals. Our analysis of object labels showed that models had quite different per- formances on different top-down categories of objects. We saw how convolutional models were successful in our study. One could use visualisation techniques to understand what parts of the signal are driving the performance of the models. Similarly, the DCGNN are learning a graph representation of the EEG electrode relationships during training. We suggest that looking at this graph might give insight into how the model has learned to represent the signal and hint at a functional connectome.   While this work replicated a well-known finding in the cognitive neuroscience literature, that the animacy of seen objects can be decoded from brain signals, this is an important step for incorporating DL techniques into the toolkit of cog- nitive neuroscience. Artificial neural networks hold much potential but need to be explored more systematically in new and older settings, to test where they are useful compared to traditional methods. Replicating known findings using new methods is a reliable and necessary preliminary step to test the method’s overall utility. With the entrance of bigger and more complex datasets like the THINGS initiative, using DL models to perform neural decoding in settings where linear models simply cannot capture the relationships is a likely next step for using functional neuroimaging to advance our knowledge of brain representations.",

This article provides a comprehensive examination\nof  the  vorticity  produced  by  nanosecond  discharges  in  air.  Using  computational  fluid\ndynamic  simulations  of  the  blast  wave  resulting  from  energy  deposition  in  the\ninterelectrode  volume  during  the  nanosecond  pulse,  we  analyze  the  various  sources  of\nvorticity during the post-discharge period. The non-uniform strength of the leading shock\nof the blast wave is found to be the primary promoter of vorticity. Other sources, such as\nthe barocline torque, play a secondary role in explaining the overall recirculation pattern.\nIn addition, the discharge cooling mechanisms are also investigated. The cooling regimes\nand  their  efficiencies  are  classified  according  to  the  discharge  parameters,  such  as  the\ninter-electrode gap, the initial kernel temperature, or the frequency of repetitive pulses.\nFinally,  a  physics-based,  non-dimensional  number  *,  equal  to  the  ratio  of  the  initial\nkernel temperature to the ambient temperature, is introduced. A numerical analysis shows\nthat the transition between the recirculating and non-recirculating flow regimes occurs for\n*  on  the  order  of  10.  This  criterion  is  validated  against  experimental  and  numerical\nresults from the literature.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nE-mail: edouard.roger@centralesupelec.fr, pierre.mariotto@centralesupelec.fr,\nchristophe.laux@centralesupelec.fr\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nIntroduction\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) discharges are characterized by repetitive voltage\npulses with short duration (~10 ns), high amplitude (~10 kV), and frequencies within 10–\n100 kHz. They are commonly applied between two pin electrodes separated by 1–10 mm\nand immersed in a gas. These discharges heat the gas in a few nanoseconds and produce\nradicals and chemicals of interest for various applications. For example, they can be used\nto dissociate CO2 into CO, which is a critical step in the synthesis of carbon-neutral fuels\n[1,2].  They  can  also  assist  combustion  by  extending  the  Lean  Blow-Out  limit  [3],  by\nstabilizing flames [4] or by improving ignition [5].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe pulsing strategy of NRP discharges is based on repeating the pattern illustrated in\nFigure  1a.  This  pattern  can  be  divided  into  the  pulse  and  the  post-discharge  phases.\nDuring the pulse phase (its duration is referred to as 𝜏pulse), the high voltage applied\nacross the electrodes creates an electric field that excites, ionizes, and dissociates the gas\nin the interelectrode gap. Depending on the type of nanosecond discharge, the post-pulse\npressure and temperature (noted 𝑃k and 𝑇k) may reach various values. For nanosecond\nglow  discharges,  the  increase  of  temperature  and  pressure  is  negligible  [6].  For  non-\nthermal sparks, the temperature increases by a few thousand Kelvin and the pressure by\na  few  bars  [7].  For  thermal  sparks,  the  temperature  increases  by  a  few  ten  thousand\nKelvin and the pressure by up to a few hundred bars [8]. The formation of the discharge\nkernel occurs on time scales shorter than the expansion timescale 𝜏rarefaction and is thus\nisochoric [9,10]. During the post-discharge phase (𝑡 = 0 s to 𝑡 = 𝜏interpulse), there is no\nlonger an electric field in the discharge column (nor a self-induced magnetic field). The\nplasma cools down and the species created during the discharge phase recombine. The\npost-discharge can be divided into the three stages illustrated in Figure 1b and Figure 2:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n1.  0 < 𝑡 < 𝜏rarefaction: a blast wave propagates into the surrounding gas (Figure 2b).\nThe  leading  shock  detaches  from  the  plasma  kernel  and  locally  increases  the\ntemperature of the ambient gas, which may produce radicals. During this phase,\ndue to the concentric rarefaction wave, the temperature of the kernel decreases\nfrom 𝑇k to 𝑇rarefaction and the pressure reaches ambient conditions (~1 atm). Note\nthat 𝜏rarefaction is often also called the hydrodynamic timescale in the literature.\n2.  𝜏rarefaction < 𝑡 < 𝜏vortex: recirculation cells may form and expel the hot gas kernel\nradially (Figures 2c, 2d1, 2e1). Vortices form near the electrode (Figure 2c) and\nmove towards the center (Figure 2d1) due to self-induced velocity [11]. Ultimately,\na symmetric torus is formed if the top and bottom vortices are of equal strength\n(Figure  2e1).  Figure  3,  taken  from  [12],  illustrates  the  phenomenon.  This  flow\nregime is responsible for the final decrease in temperature from 𝑇rarefaction to 𝑇end\n(see  Figure  1b).  If  the  vortices  are  of  unequal  strength,  an  axial  jet  may  form\ninstead of a radial jet. If the created vorticity is too low, the vortices dissipate,\nand no torus is generated.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n3.  𝜏rarefaction < 𝑡 < 𝜏diff: if no recirculation cell appears (or in parallel to this), the\nhot kernel cools by thermal diffusion (Figures 2d2, 2e2). Its temperature decreases\nfrom 𝑇rarefaction to 𝑇end (see Figure 1b).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.8**\nVoltage\n[kV]\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nFlow dynamic effects\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nSpark  Expansion\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n1st pulse\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nInterpulse\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nRecirculation\nDiffusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.8**r== 0.2**\n2nd pulse\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n𝜏pulse~10 ns\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nTime (not to scale)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n𝜏interpulse\n~100 µs\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nFlow dynamic effects\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nTemperature\n[K]\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.5**\nSpark  Expansion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.5**\nTemperature  at  the  end\nof the pulse\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nRecirculation\nDiffusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nTemperature  after  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nkernel rarefaction\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n𝑇rarefaction\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nTemperature at\nthe end of the\npost-discharge\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\n𝜏pulse~10 ns\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n𝜏rarefaction\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\n𝜏vortex\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n𝜏interpulse\n~100 µs\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nTime (not to scale)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 1.

The images are taken\nfrom [12].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHowever, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the origin of this recirculation.\nSome  studies  claim  that  the  recirculation  is  caused  by  a  quasi-instantaneous  jump  of\nvorticity  induced  by  the  non-uniform  leading  shock  [13].  Others  consider  that  this\nrecirculation is mainly linked to the barocline torque, also induced by the shock [14–16].\nYet other publications attribute the recirculation to viscous effects in the boundary layers\n[17]. Thus, there is a need to clarify the dominant source of vorticity in plasma spark\ndischarges. This will be useful for better understanding the physics and optimizing the\ndesign  of  future  industrial  reactors  for  cooling  or  mixing  purposes  (by  changing  the\nfrequency of the pulses, their energy, or the interelectrode gap length). This study has\nthree  main  objectives:  (1)  to  identify  the  cooling  mechanisms  occurring  during  the\ninterpulse, (2) to determine the primary vorticity sources in the post-discharge, (3) to\nderive a non-dimensional number * to predict the flow regime.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn  Section II,  we  present  the  numerical  model  with  which  we  perform  CFD\n(Computational  Fluid  Dynamics)  simulations  of  the  post-discharge  for  tens  of\nconfigurations (varying the gap length and the initial kernel temperature). The working\ngas is air. The simulations are initialized with the post-pulse conditions (since we do not\nmodel the pulse phase).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn  Section III,  we  examine  the  kernel  cooling  mechanisms  (expansion,  recirculation,\ndiffusion) predicted in the various CFD simulations.

We use the 2D velocity, pressure, and\ndensity fields provided by the CFD simulations to estimate and compare the magnitude\nof  these  sources  along  the  central  vortex  trajectory.  We  show  that  the  dominant\nmechanism  is  the  quasi-instantaneous  jump  of  vorticity  induced  by  the  non-uniform\nleading  shock.  We  also  demonstrate  that  the  quasi-instantaneous  jump  of  vorticity\ndepends on the ratio of the initial kernel temperature to the ambient temperature.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn Section V, we build a new, physics-based, dimensionless number  * to characterize\nthe flow that emerges during the interpulse.

The electrode\nwalls  are  assumed  to  be  adiabatic  with  a  no-slip  boundary  condition.  A  finite-volume\nmethod is employed to solve Eqns. (1)–(7). Convective flux calculations are based on the\nRoe  solver  [19,20],  and  spatial  reconstruction  at  the  cell  interfaces  is  achieved  with  a\nthird-order MUSCL scheme [21] that blends a central differencing scheme and a second-\norder upwind scheme with slope limiters [22]. Diffusive flux calculations are performed\nwith  a  second-order  central  differencing  scheme.  We  use  the  Green-Gauss  node-based\nmethod [23,24] to evaluate the gradients for the two differencing schemes. Finally, time\nintegration  is  performed  using  a  first-order  implicit  method  [25].  The  simulations  are\nperformed up to t = 200 µs, with time steps progressively increasing from 50 ps to 10 ns.\nThus,  the  simulations  capture  the  interpulse  flow  physics  for  any  repetitive  discharge\nwith a frequency above 5 kHz.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nInitially, the plasma kernel is assumed to be uniform at a temperature 𝑇k and pressure\n𝑃k. Its shape is an ellipse with a semi-major axis of 𝐿/2 + 10−4 and a semi-minor axis of\n𝑅d = 100 μm, where 𝑅d is the discharge radius (see Figure 4). This elliptical shape is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninspired by the streamer simulations done in [26]. We define the parameter 𝑟d(𝑧) (see\nEqn.

To ensure a continuous transition\nbetween  the  hot  kernel  at  𝑇k  and  the  cold  ambient  gas  at  𝑇out,  we  use  the  following\napproximation of a step function:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n𝑇 (𝑟, 𝑧, 𝑡 = 0) =   𝑇out +\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n(𝑇k − 𝑇out)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe power 40 in the denominator controls the steepness of the transition at the edge of\nthe kernel.

In addition, we neglect the change of\nmolar mass because the gas does not significantly dissociate or ionize in the temperature\nrange considered in this article (𝑇k = 500–6000 K). With these assumptions, the initial\npressure and temperature profiles are related as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.4**\n𝑃 (𝑟, 𝑧, 𝑡 = 0) = 𝑇 (𝑟, 𝑧, 𝑡 = 0) ×\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\n𝑃out\n𝑇out\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe air heated by the discharge is assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(LTE) throughout the post-discharge.

Second, we extend the analysis to tens of simulations and show\nthat the cooling of the discharges can be classified into seven regimes (labeled A–G).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nIII.A.  Description of different characteristic flows\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nIn this Subsection, we focus on the following four configurations:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n1.  𝐿 = 1 mm, 𝑇k = 5500 K\n2.  𝐿 = 5 mm, 𝑇k = 5500 K\n3.  𝐿 = 1 mm, 𝑇k = 500 K\n4.  𝐿 = 5 mm, 𝑇k = 500 K\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe four cases are representative of glow and spark nanosecond discharges across typical\ngap lengths used in experiments (see Table 1 of [6]). For each simulation, we calculate\nthe mean temperature 𝑇̅ along the interelectrode axis (see Eqn. (11)). The results are\ncompared in Figure 5. In addition, the temperature, velocity, and azimuthal vorticityb\nfields  at  different  timesteps  are shown  in  Figures 6–9,  respectively  in  the  left,  middle,\nand right columns of each Figure. In the following paragraphs, we analyze the cooling\nphases of each case, using Figure 5. In parallel, we study the flow behind these different\nphases with more details in Figures 6 to 9.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n𝑇 (𝑟 = 0, 𝑧, 𝑡)𝑑𝑧\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.4**\nRarefaction wave  Recirculation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nDiffusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nCooling by recirculation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\nCooling by recirculation\nand diffusion\nCooling by\ndiffusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nCooling by\ndiffusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 5.

The\ntemperature relaxes to a plateau 0.2 µs later. At 0.5 µs, Figure 6 shows the expanding\nleading shock, characterized by a non-uniform curvature. At 10 µs, the temperature field\nreveals a prominent clockwise recirculation vortex centered on point B, bringing cold gas\ninto  the  interelectrode  region  and  expelling  the  hot  plasma  kernel  axially  along  the\nsymmetry  plane. The vorticity  field  indicates  that  this  clockwise  recirculation  pattern\n(blue) dominates other counterclockwise recirculation vortices (red) and originates from\na region centered on point A in the vorticity snapshot at 500 ns. This region is located\nnear the electrode, and the clockwise vortices appear after the leading shock front has\npassed. The vortex ring has a self-induced velocity [11] directed towards the center of\nthe gap. Subsequently, the vortex moves toward point C, transporting the gases along\nthe interelectrode axis, trapping them close to the interelectrode plane, and forcing them\nto evacuate radially [29]. The vortex is responsible for the cooling between 5 and 20 µs\nshown in Figure 5a (blue curve). This process is summarized in Figure 10.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn Case 2, the interelectrode gap length is 5 mm, five times longer than in Case 1. The\norange curve of Figure 5a shows that the post-rarefaction temperature decrease is slower\nand  occurs  between  5  and  300 µs.  In  Figure  7,  we  still  observe  the  propagation  of  a\nleading shock wave, the generation of clockwise vorticity near the electrode (point A),\nand the displacement of the vortex towards the center along the path A-B-C. However,\nat  𝑡 = 80 μs,  the  center  of  the  vortex  has  only  traveled  about  a  quarter  of  the\ninterelectrode gap distance (point C) and has not reached the middle plane.  Although\nthe  same  amount  of  vorticity  was  created  initially  at  point A,  the  vortex  needs  more\ntime  to  transport  fresh  gas  to  the  symmetry  plane  in  Case 2  than  in  Case 1.  This\nsituation  corresponds  to  stages  (a)–(c)  in  Figure  10.  During  this  longer  travel,  three\nphenomena affect the kernel cooling:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n•  Thermal diffusion becomes significant at timescales around tens of microseconds\nand adds its cooling effect to the convective cooling mechanism described above.\n•  The vortex dissipates energy via viscous effects, decelerates, and may even vanish\nbefore  reaching  the  symmetry  plane.  In  such  cases,  only  diffusion  remains  to\nslowly cool the plasma kernel. This corresponds to the diffusive regime shown in\nFigure 2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n•  Breakdown of the next pulse: if the frequency is high enough, the cooling processes\nmay be interrupted by a new pulse, which heats back the interelectrode region.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCases 3 and 4 correspond to the same gap lengths as in Cases 1 and 2, except that now\nthe initial temperature of the plasma kernel is set to 500 K instead of 5500 K. Figures 8\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand 9 show that the amount of vorticity is much smaller and no recirculation cell appears.\nThe temperature decreases because of diffusion only (green and red curves in Figure 5b)\nbetween 5 and 300 µs (on the same time scale as in Case 2). This corresponds also to the\ndiffusive regime shown in Figure 2 and discussed in Dumitrache et al. [15].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAs  far  as  we  know,  there  are  no  quantitative  temperature  measurements  available  to\nvalidate the predictions of the CFD model shown in Figure 5 and Figures 6–9 during the\nfull interpulse. Indeed, these measurements are complex and usually stop before the gas\nhas  recirculated  [9].  However,  we  can  make  a  preliminary  comparison  between  the\ntemperature snapshots of Figure 6 and the OH-PLIF images recorded by Stepanyan et al.\n[12] and shown in Figure 3. We observe a similar collapse into a toroidal shape of the\ntemperature field and the fluorescence signal. This similarity gives us confidence that our\nnumerical model represents the post-discharge behavior following a nanosecond pulse.\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nTemperature\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nVelocity\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\nVorticity\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.5**\nShock front\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\nBlue: clockwise rotation, 𝝎 < 𝟎\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 6.

Additionally, we consider different pulse frequencies 𝑓 spanning\nthe range 5–100 kHz. For each set of discharge parameters (𝑇k, 𝐿, 𝑓), we calculate the\nmean temperature along the interelectrode axis just before the next pulse 𝑇̅\nend (see Eqn.\n(12) and Figure 1b).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nend ≡ 𝑇̅(𝑡 = 1/𝑓)\n𝑇̅\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis average temperature 𝑇̅\nend serves as a simple scalar indicative of the recirculation\nregime. Before examining the results, several cases can be identified in relation to what\nwe previously described in Figure 5 and Figure 10:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nend ≈ 𝑇k  means  that  neither  expansion,  recirculation,  nor  diffusion  can\nsignificantly cool the kernel before the next pulse. This case does not occur in our\nsimulations.  It  would  only  occur  if  the  frequency  were  high  enough  (𝑓 −1 >\n𝜏rarefaction).\nend ≈ 𝑇k/2 means that recirculation and diffusion have no effect on the cooling\nof the kernel before the next pulse. The temperature decreases only through the\nexpansion process (Figure 5a).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nend ≲ 𝑇k/2 means that the cooling is incomplete. Either the recirculation\ncell did not have enough time to expel all the hot gas (as schematized in Figure\n10c), and/or diffusion was still in progress when the next pulse started.\nend ≈ 𝑇out = 300 K  indicates  that  complete  cooling  is  obtained  thanks  to\nexpansion, recirculation (see Figure 10d) and/or diffusion. The kernel reaches the\ntemperature of the surrounding gas.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.3**\nend as a function of 𝑇k, 𝐿, and 𝑓.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFirst, Figure 11a shows 𝑇̅\nend for different values of the initial kernel temperature 𝑇k and\ngap  length  𝐿,  at  a  given  frequency  𝑓 = 40 kHz.  Four  regimes  can  be  identified.  In\nregime A,  corresponding  to  the  top  left-hand corner,  we  have 𝑇̅\nend ≈ 𝑇out.  This  is  the\nregime  of  case  1  (𝑇k = 5500 K, 𝐿 = 1 mm),  for  which  the  recirculation  is  sufficiently\nquick and strong to entrain cold gases along the pin-to-pin axis. If we increase the gap\nlength,  we  reach  regime B,  where  the  vortices  are  not  fast  enough  to  travel  over  the\nentire gap during the interpulse duration 1/𝑓. The cooling is only partial, mainly due to\nexpansion but also partly to diffusion. If the gap length is increased, the final temperature\nincreases  because  the  fraction  of  gap  length  crossed  by  the  vortices  decreases.\nInterestingly, the separation between regime A and regime B is not vertical: increasing\nthe kernel temperature increases the strength of the vortices, which move faster and can\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncross  a  longer  portion  of  the  gap.  The  link  between  the  kernel  temperature  and  the\namount  of  vorticity  generated  is  discussed  in  Section IV.C.  If  the  initial  kernel\ntemperature is relatively low (below 1000 K), the kernel completely cools (𝑇̅\nend ≈ 𝑇out)\nregardless of the gap length: this is characteristic of the absence of recirculation. Cooling\noccurs only by expansion and radial diffusion. We refer to this regime as D. In regime C,\nthe final temperature does not fully equilibrate with the ambient temperature before the\nfollowing  pulse.  In  addition,  𝑇̅\nend  does  not  depend  on  the  gap  length,  hence  the main\ncooling mechanisms of regime C are also expansion and diffusion.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSecond, Figure 11b shows 𝑇̅\nend for different values of the frequency and gap length at a\ngiven initial temperature 𝑇k = 3300 K. At high frequencies (100 kHz), the interpulse is\nvery short, and only expansion has enough time to occur, partially cooling the kernel.\nThe  final  temperature  is  approximately  half  of  the  initial  one,  regardless  of  the  gap\nlength. We call this regime E. In the bottom left-hand corner, we fall back into regime A.\nThe interpulse is sufficiently long for the vortices to travel the entire gap length. The\nkernel can fully cool even at long gaps if the frequency is sufficiently low. The rest of the\ndomain can be split into approximately three zones. If the frequency is too high for the\ndiffusion  to  occur,  we  are  in  regime B.  Otherwise,  the  three  phenomena  (expansion,\nrecirculation,  and  diffusion)  are  all  significant  and  contribute  to  kernel  cooling.  We\ndistinguish  regime F,  where  the  cooling  is  partial,  and  regime G,  where  the  cooling  is\ncomplete.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThird, Figure 11c shows 𝑇̅\nend for different values of the frequency and initial temperature\nat a given gap length 𝐿 = 2 mm. In this parametric space, regime identification is more\ncomplex. We suggest an approximate mapping of the regimes A–G. We remark that at\na fixed frequency of  20 kHz, a post-discharge initially at 6000 K cools completely and\nreaches  300 K,  unlike  a  post-discharge  initially  at  2000 K.  This  difference  in  cooling\nefficiency is attributed to a difference in the strength of the recirculation cell. The blast\nwave generates more vorticity in the hotter scenario, leading to faster flow recirculation.\nConsequently, the hotter scenario allows enough time for the cold gases to be brought\nalong the interelectrode axis.

         " Origin  of  the  Recirculation  Flow  Pattern  Induced  by Nanosecond  Discharges its Development   and  Criterion   Nanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) discharges are characterized by repetitive voltage pulses with short duration (~10 ns), high amplitude (~10 kV), and frequencies within 10– 100 kHz. They are commonly applied between two pin electrodes separated by 1–10 mm and immersed in a gas. These discharges heat the gas in a few nanoseconds and produce radicals and chemicals of interest for various applications. For example, they can be used to dissociate CO2 into CO, which is a critical step in the synthesis of carbon-neutral fuels [1,2].  They  can  also  assist  combustion  by  extending  the  Lean  Blow-Out  limit  [3],  by stabilizing flames [4] or by improving ignition [5].   The pulsing strategy of NRP discharges is based on repeating the pattern illustrated in Figure  1a.  This  pattern  can  be  divided  into  the  pulse  and  the  post-discharge  phases. During the pulse phase (its duration is referred to as 𝜏pulse), the high voltage applied across the electrodes creates an electric field that excites, ionizes, and dissociates the gas in the interelectrode gap. Depending on the type of nanosecond discharge, the post-pulse pressure and temperature (noted 𝑃k and 𝑇k) may reach various values. For nanosecond glow  discharges,  the  increase  of  temperature  and  pressure  is  negligible  [6].  For  non- thermal sparks, the temperature increases by a few thousand Kelvin and the pressure by a  few  bars  [7].  For  thermal  sparks,  the  temperature  increases  by  a  few  ten  thousand Kelvin and the pressure by up to a few hundred bars [8]. The formation of the discharge kernel occurs on time scales shorter than the expansion timescale 𝜏rarefaction and is thus isochoric [9,10]. During the post-discharge phase (𝑡 = 0 s to 𝑡 = 𝜏interpulse), there is no longer an electric field in the discharge column (nor a self-induced magnetic field). The plasma cools down and the species created during the discharge phase recombine. The post-discharge can be divided into the three stages illustrated in Figure 1b and Figure 2:   1.  0 < 𝑡 < 𝜏rarefaction: a blast wave propagates into the surrounding gas (Figure 2b). The  leading  shock  detaches  from  the  plasma  kernel  and  locally  increases  the temperature of the ambient gas, which may produce radicals. During this phase, due to the concentric rarefaction wave, the temperature of the kernel decreases from 𝑇k to 𝑇rarefaction and the pressure reaches ambient conditions (~1 atm). Note that 𝜏rarefaction is often also called the hydrodynamic timescale in the literature. 2.  𝜏rarefaction < 𝑡 < 𝜏vortex: recirculation cells may form and expel the hot gas kernel radially (Figures 2c, 2d1, 2e1). Vortices form near the electrode (Figure 2c) and move towards the center (Figure 2d1) due to self-induced velocity [11]. Ultimately, a symmetric torus is formed if the top and bottom vortices are of equal strength (Figure  2e1).  Figure  3,  taken  from  [12],  illustrates  the  phenomenon.  This  flow regime is responsible for the final decrease in temperature from 𝑇rarefaction to 𝑇end (see  Figure  1b).  If  the  vortices  are  of  unequal  strength,  an  axial  jet  may  form instead of a radial jet. If the created vorticity is too low, the vortices dissipate, and no torus is generated.   3.  𝜏rarefaction < 𝑡 < 𝜏diff: if no recirculation cell appears (or in parallel to this), the hot kernel cools by thermal diffusion (Figures 2d2, 2e2). Its temperature decreases from 𝑇rarefaction to 𝑇end (see Figure 1b).   Spark  Expansion   1st pulse   2nd pulse   𝜏pulse~10 ns   Time (not to scale)   𝜏interpulse ~100 µs   Spark  Expansion   𝜏pulse~10 ns   Time (not to scale)   However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the origin of this recirculation. Some  studies  claim  that  the  recirculation  is  caused  by  a  quasi-instantaneous  jump  of vorticity  induced  by  the  non-uniform  leading  shock  [13].  Others  consider  that  this recirculation is mainly linked to the barocline torque, also induced by the shock [14–16]. Yet other publications attribute the recirculation to viscous effects in the boundary layers [17]. Thus, there is a need to clarify the dominant source of vorticity in plasma spark discharges. This will be useful for better understanding the physics and optimizing the design  of  future  industrial  reactors  for  cooling  or  mixing  purposes  (by  changing  the frequency of the pulses, their energy, or the interelectrode gap length). This study has three  main  objectives:  (1)  to  identify  the  cooling  mechanisms  occurring  during  the interpulse, (2) to determine the primary vorticity sources in the post-discharge, (3) to derive a non-dimensional number * to predict the flow regime.   In  Section II,  we  present  the  numerical  model  with  which  we  perform  CFD (Computational  Fluid  Dynamics)  simulations  of  the  post-discharge  for  tens  of configurations (varying the gap length and the initial kernel temperature). The working gas is air. The simulations are initialized with the post-pulse conditions (since we do not model the pulse phase).   In  Section III,  we  examine  the  kernel  cooling  mechanisms  (expansion,  recirculation, diffusion) predicted in the various CFD simulations. We identify seven different cooling regimes depending on the gap length, initial heating, and repetitive discharge frequency.   In Section IV, we review the sources of vorticity. We use the 2D velocity, pressure, and density fields provided by the CFD simulations to estimate and compare the magnitude of  these  sources  along  the  central  vortex  trajectory.  We  show  that  the  dominant mechanism  is  the  quasi-instantaneous  jump  of  vorticity  induced  by  the  non-uniform leading  shock.  We  also  demonstrate  that  the  quasi-instantaneous  jump  of  vorticity depends on the ratio of the initial kernel temperature to the ambient temperature.   In Section V, we build a new, physics-based, dimensionless number  * to characterize the flow that emerges during the interpulse. Through a literature review, we develop a criterion based on * to predict the flow regime (recirculating or not).   II.  Description of the numerical model   The fluid dynamic resulting from the discharge is simulated using the commercial Ansys® Fluent®  code,  release  22.1.0  [18].  We  solve  the  compressible  2D  non-reactive  Navier- Stokes equations (Eqns. (1)–(7)), in the computational domain represented in Figure 4. Only a quarter of the domain is simulated because the configuration is axisymmetric and has a plane of symmetry at 𝑧 = 0.   + ∇⃗      ⋅ (𝑢⃗(𝜌𝐸 + 𝑃 )) = ∇⃗      ⋅ (𝜆∇⃗     𝑇 + 𝜏 ⋅ 𝑢⃗)   𝑇 ℎ = ℎ° + ∫ 𝑐𝑝(𝑇 ′)𝑑𝑇′ 𝑇ref   In the previous equations, 𝜌 is the density of the gas, 𝑢⃗ the velocity, 𝑃  the pressure, 𝑇 the temperature, 𝐸 the total specific energy, 𝜏  the stress tensor, 𝐼 the identity tensor, ℎ   the specific enthalpy, ℎ° the standard enthalpy of formation at the reference temperature 𝑇ref ,  ℳ  the  molar  mass, 𝑅  the  ideal  gas  constant.  𝑐𝑝, 𝜆 and  𝜇  are  the  specific  heat capacity, the thermal conductivity, and the dynamic viscosity, respectively.   After completing a grid convergence study, we selected an unstructured mesh with an average cell size of 2 µm with clustering near the pin-shaped electrodes. The electrode walls  are  assumed  to  be  adiabatic  with  a  no-slip  boundary  condition.  A  finite-volume method is employed to solve Eqns. (1)–(7). Convective flux calculations are based on the Roe  solver  [19,20],  and  spatial  reconstruction  at  the  cell  interfaces  is  achieved  with  a third-order MUSCL scheme [21] that blends a central differencing scheme and a second- order upwind scheme with slope limiters [22]. Diffusive flux calculations are performed with  a  second-order  central  differencing  scheme.  We  use  the  Green-Gauss  node-based method [23,24] to evaluate the gradients for the two differencing schemes. Finally, time integration  is  performed  using  a  first-order  implicit  method  [25].  The  simulations  are performed up to t = 200 µs, with time steps progressively increasing from 50 ps to 10 ns. Thus,  the  simulations  capture  the  interpulse  flow  physics  for  any  repetitive  discharge with a frequency above 5 kHz.   Initially, the plasma kernel is assumed to be uniform at a temperature 𝑇k and pressure 𝑃k. Its shape is an ellipse with a semi-major axis of 𝐿/2 + 10−4 and a semi-minor axis of 𝑅d = 100 μm, where 𝑅d is the discharge radius (see Figure 4). This elliptical shape is   inspired by the streamer simulations done in [26]. We define the parameter 𝑟d(𝑧) (see Eqn. (8)), such that the kernel is the region where 𝑧 ≤ 𝐿 2⁄ + 10−4 and 𝑟 ≤ 𝑟d(𝑧).   The initial temperature field is thus given by Eqn. (9). To ensure a continuous transition between  the  hot  kernel  at  𝑇k  and  the  cold  ambient  gas  at  𝑇out,  we  use  the  following approximation of a step function:   𝑇 (𝑟, 𝑧, 𝑡 = 0) =   𝑇out +   The power 40 in the denominator controls the steepness of the transition at the edge of the kernel. We chose this value to model a steep transition.   The pulse heating is assumed to be isochoric because its duration (𝜏pulse) is usually much shorter than the expansion timescale (𝜏rarefaction). In addition, we neglect the change of molar mass because the gas does not significantly dissociate or ionize in the temperature range considered in this article (𝑇k = 500–6000 K). With these assumptions, the initial pressure and temperature profiles are related as follows:   𝑃 (𝑟, 𝑧, 𝑡 = 0) = 𝑇 (𝑟, 𝑧, 𝑡 = 0) ×   The air heated by the discharge is assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) throughout the post-discharge. The thermodynamic and transport properties (𝑐𝑝, 𝜆, 𝜇) are taken from [27].   The various assumptions made for the simulations (kernel shape, kernel radius, electrode shape, steepness of the transition at the edge of the kernel, LTE) are further discussed in Appendix A. We make new CFD simulations, and we show that these assumptions do not significantly influence the cooling of the kernel and do not alter the conclusions made in this article, except if the electrodes are planar.   III.  Description of the interpulse flow and identification of cooling   regimes   In this Section, we perform simulations of the post-discharge varying the gap length 𝐿 from 1 to 5 mm and the initial temperature of the kernel 𝑇k from 500 to 6000 K, typical of glow discharges or non-thermal sparks. First, we provide a detailed description of the flow from four characteristic simulations corresponding to parameters (𝐿, 𝑇k) at the edge of the domain explored. Second, we extend the analysis to tens of simulations and show that the cooling of the discharges can be classified into seven regimes (labeled A–G).   III.A.  Description of different characteristic flows   In this Subsection, we focus on the following four configurations:   1.  𝐿 = 1 mm, 𝑇k = 5500 K 2.  𝐿 = 5 mm, 𝑇k = 5500 K 3.  𝐿 = 1 mm, 𝑇k = 500 K 4.  𝐿 = 5 mm, 𝑇k = 500 K   The four cases are representative of glow and spark nanosecond discharges across typical gap lengths used in experiments (see Table 1 of [6]). For each simulation, we calculate the mean temperature 𝑇̅ along the interelectrode axis (see Eqn. (11)). The results are compared in Figure 5. In addition, the temperature, velocity, and azimuthal vorticityb fields  at  different  timesteps  are shown  in  Figures 6–9,  respectively  in  the  left,  middle, and right columns of each Figure. In the following paragraphs, we analyze the cooling phases of each case, using Figure 5. In parallel, we study the flow behind these different phases with more details in Figures 6 to 9.   𝑇 (𝑟 = 0, 𝑧, 𝑡)𝑑𝑧   Rarefaction wave  Recirculation   b 𝜔 ≡ (∇⃗      × u⃗) ⋅ 𝑒𝜃⃗       with 𝑒𝜃⃗       the azimuthal unit vector.   In  Case 1  (𝐿 = 1 mm,  𝑇k = 5500 K),  the  blue  curve  of  Figure  5a  shows  that  the temperature of the plasma kernel decreases abruptly between 0.02 and 0.1 µs due to the rarefaction wave, reaching approximately half of its initial value at 𝜏rarefaction = 0.1 μs. A secondary shock (see [28] for theoretical details) increases the temperature by more than  500 K  between  0.1  and  0.2 µs  (this  is  marked  by  an  asterisk  in  Figure  5a).  The temperature relaxes to a plateau 0.2 µs later. At 0.5 µs, Figure 6 shows the expanding leading shock, characterized by a non-uniform curvature. At 10 µs, the temperature field reveals a prominent clockwise recirculation vortex centered on point B, bringing cold gas into  the  interelectrode  region  and  expelling  the  hot  plasma  kernel  axially  along  the symmetry  plane. The vorticity  field  indicates  that  this  clockwise  recirculation  pattern (blue) dominates other counterclockwise recirculation vortices (red) and originates from a region centered on point A in the vorticity snapshot at 500 ns. This region is located near the electrode, and the clockwise vortices appear after the leading shock front has passed. The vortex ring has a self-induced velocity [11] directed towards the center of the gap. Subsequently, the vortex moves toward point C, transporting the gases along the interelectrode axis, trapping them close to the interelectrode plane, and forcing them to evacuate radially [29]. The vortex is responsible for the cooling between 5 and 20 µs shown in Figure 5a (blue curve). This process is summarized in Figure 10.   In Case 2, the interelectrode gap length is 5 mm, five times longer than in Case 1. The orange curve of Figure 5a shows that the post-rarefaction temperature decrease is slower and  occurs  between  5  and  300 µs.  In  Figure  7,  we  still  observe  the  propagation  of  a leading shock wave, the generation of clockwise vorticity near the electrode (point A), and the displacement of the vortex towards the center along the path A-B-C. However, at  𝑡 = 80 μs,  the  center  of  the  vortex  has  only  traveled  about  a  quarter  of  the interelectrode gap distance (point C) and has not reached the middle plane.  Although the  same  amount  of  vorticity  was  created  initially  at  point A,  the  vortex  needs  more time  to  transport  fresh  gas  to  the  symmetry  plane  in  Case 2  than  in  Case 1.  This situation  corresponds  to  stages  (a)–(c)  in  Figure  10.  During  this  longer  travel,  three phenomena affect the kernel cooling:   •  Thermal diffusion becomes significant at timescales around tens of microseconds and adds its cooling effect to the convective cooling mechanism described above. •  The vortex dissipates energy via viscous effects, decelerates, and may even vanish before  reaching  the  symmetry  plane.  In  such  cases,  only  diffusion  remains  to slowly cool the plasma kernel. This corresponds to the diffusive regime shown in Figure 2.   •  Breakdown of the next pulse: if the frequency is high enough, the cooling processes may be interrupted by a new pulse, which heats back the interelectrode region.   Cases 3 and 4 correspond to the same gap lengths as in Cases 1 and 2, except that now the initial temperature of the plasma kernel is set to 500 K instead of 5500 K. Figures 8   and 9 show that the amount of vorticity is much smaller and no recirculation cell appears. The temperature decreases because of diffusion only (green and red curves in Figure 5b) between 5 and 300 µs (on the same time scale as in Case 2). This corresponds also to the diffusive regime shown in Figure 2 and discussed in Dumitrache et al. [15].   As  far  as  we  know,  there  are  no  quantitative  temperature  measurements  available  to validate the predictions of the CFD model shown in Figure 5 and Figures 6–9 during the full interpulse. Indeed, these measurements are complex and usually stop before the gas has  recirculated  [9].  However,  we  can  make  a  preliminary  comparison  between  the temperature snapshots of Figure 6 and the OH-PLIF images recorded by Stepanyan et al. [12] and shown in Figure 3. We observe a similar collapse into a toroidal shape of the temperature field and the fluorescence signal. This similarity gives us confidence that our numerical model represents the post-discharge behavior following a nanosecond pulse.   In this Subsection, we expand our analysis to all the CFD simulations performed with gap lengths 𝐿 ranging from 1 mm to 5 mm and initial kernel temperatures 𝑇k ranging from 500 K to 6000 K. Additionally, we consider different pulse frequencies 𝑓 spanning the range 5–100 kHz. For each set of discharge parameters (𝑇k, 𝐿, 𝑓), we calculate the mean temperature along the interelectrode axis just before the next pulse 𝑇̅ end (see Eqn. (12) and Figure 1b).   end ≡ 𝑇̅(𝑡 = 1/𝑓) 𝑇̅   This average temperature 𝑇̅ end serves as a simple scalar indicative of the recirculation regime. Before examining the results, several cases can be identified in relation to what we previously described in Figure 5 and Figure 10:   end ≈ 𝑇k  means  that  neither  expansion,  recirculation,  nor  diffusion  can significantly cool the kernel before the next pulse. This case does not occur in our simulations.  It  would  only  occur  if  the  frequency  were  high  enough  (𝑓 −1 > 𝜏rarefaction). end ≈ 𝑇k/2 means that recirculation and diffusion have no effect on the cooling of the kernel before the next pulse. The temperature decreases only through the expansion process (Figure 5a).   end ≲ 𝑇k/2 means that the cooling is incomplete. Either the recirculation cell did not have enough time to expel all the hot gas (as schematized in Figure 10c), and/or diffusion was still in progress when the next pulse started. end ≈ 𝑇out = 300 K  indicates  that  complete  cooling  is  obtained  thanks  to expansion, recirculation (see Figure 10d) and/or diffusion. The kernel reaches the temperature of the surrounding gas.   end as a function of 𝑇k, 𝐿, and 𝑓.   First, Figure 11a shows 𝑇̅ end for different values of the initial kernel temperature 𝑇k and gap  length  𝐿,  at  a  given  frequency  𝑓 = 40 kHz.  Four  regimes  can  be  identified.  In regime A,  corresponding  to  the  top  left-hand corner,  we  have 𝑇̅ end ≈ 𝑇out.  This  is  the regime  of  case  1  (𝑇k = 5500 K, 𝐿 = 1 mm),  for  which  the  recirculation  is  sufficiently quick and strong to entrain cold gases along the pin-to-pin axis. If we increase the gap length,  we  reach  regime B,  where  the  vortices  are  not  fast  enough  to  travel  over  the entire gap during the interpulse duration 1/𝑓. The cooling is only partial, mainly due to expansion but also partly to diffusion. If the gap length is increased, the final temperature increases  because  the  fraction  of  gap  length  crossed  by  the  vortices  decreases. Interestingly, the separation between regime A and regime B is not vertical: increasing the kernel temperature increases the strength of the vortices, which move faster and can   cross  a  longer  portion  of  the  gap.  The  link  between  the  kernel  temperature  and  the amount  of  vorticity  generated  is  discussed  in  Section IV.C.  If  the  initial  kernel temperature is relatively low (below 1000 K), the kernel completely cools (𝑇̅ end ≈ 𝑇out) regardless of the gap length: this is characteristic of the absence of recirculation. Cooling occurs only by expansion and radial diffusion. We refer to this regime as D. In regime C, the final temperature does not fully equilibrate with the ambient temperature before the following  pulse.  In  addition,  𝑇̅ end  does  not  depend  on  the  gap  length,  hence  the main cooling mechanisms of regime C are also expansion and diffusion.   Second, Figure 11b shows 𝑇̅ end for different values of the frequency and gap length at a given initial temperature 𝑇k = 3300 K. At high frequencies (100 kHz), the interpulse is very short, and only expansion has enough time to occur, partially cooling the kernel. The  final  temperature  is  approximately  half  of  the  initial  one,  regardless  of  the  gap length. We call this regime E. In the bottom left-hand corner, we fall back into regime A. The interpulse is sufficiently long for the vortices to travel the entire gap length. The kernel can fully cool even at long gaps if the frequency is sufficiently low. The rest of the domain can be split into approximately three zones. If the frequency is too high for the diffusion  to  occur,  we  are  in  regime B.  Otherwise,  the  three  phenomena  (expansion, recirculation,  and  diffusion)  are  all  significant  and  contribute  to  kernel  cooling.  We distinguish  regime F,  where  the  cooling  is  partial,  and  regime G,  where  the  cooling  is complete.   Third, Figure 11c shows 𝑇̅ end for different values of the frequency and initial temperature at a given gap length 𝐿 = 2 mm. In this parametric space, regime identification is more complex. We suggest an approximate mapping of the regimes A–G. We remark that at a fixed frequency of  20 kHz, a post-discharge initially at 6000 K cools completely and reaches  300 K,  unlike  a  post-discharge  initially  at  2000 K.  This  difference  in  cooling efficiency is attributed to a difference in the strength of the recirculation cell. The blast wave generates more vorticity in the hotter scenario, leading to faster flow recirculation. Consequently, the hotter scenario allows enough time for the cold gases to be brought along the interelectrode axis. We provide a physical explanation of this phenomenon in the following Section.   In  this  Section,  we  quantitatively  analyze  the  vorticity  sources  that  govern  the  flow dynamic  regimes  (recirculating  or  not)  and  influence  the  various  cooling  regimes discussed  in  Section III.  In  Subsection IV.A,  we  provide  a  theoretical  review  of  the physical  processes  driving  the  different  sources  of  vorticity.  In  Subsection IV.B,  we compute and compare the sources of vorticity along a particle trajectory that follows the center of the vortex responsible for radially expelling the hot gas and cooling the kernel. In Subsection IV.C, we show that the amount of vorticity generated depends on the ratio of the initial kernel temperature to the ambient temperature.   The  vorticity  change  is  given  by  the  vorticity  balance  equation  [30,31].  Since  our configuration  is  axisymmetric,  we  only focus on  the  azimuthal  component  of  vorticity 𝜔 ≡ (∇⃗      × u⃗) ⋅ 𝑒𝜃⃗      . In a Eulerian description, the balance equation reads:   The first term on the right-hand side of Eqn. (13) corresponds to the convective flux of vorticity from/to other regions of the flow. This term is included in the definition of the Lagrangian/material derivative 𝑑𝜔 𝑑𝑡⁄ = 𝜕𝜔 𝜕𝑡⁄ − 𝑆advection.   𝑆advection = −(𝑢⃗ ⋅ ∇⃗     )𝜔   The following four terms (𝑆barocline, 𝑆viscous, 𝑆stretching, 𝑆expansion) correspond to sources and sinks changing the vorticity in continuous flow regions (i.e. everywhere except across a discontinuous shock). They account for changes in vorticity due to pressure and density gradients (the barocline torque, 𝑆barocline), viscous dissipation (𝑆viscous), vortex stretching (𝑆stretching) or density changes (𝑆expansion). These terms read:   𝑆viscous = ∇⃗      × (   𝑆expansion = −𝜔(∇⃗      ⋅ 𝑢⃗)",

Furthermore, once medical\nhelp is sought, many patients miss follow-up appointments [3].\nThe situation can be much worse in impoverished/developing\nnations (or even in rural areas within the United States) as\nfamilies can face additional challenges in accessing healthcare\ndue to prohibitive costs, extended waiting time for specialist\nconsultations, or the general scarcity of medical expertise.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOn the other hand, other promising sensing modalities have\nemerged over the past few years. For instance, wireless signals,\nnow ubiquitous, have created new opportunities for sensing\nand learning about the environment, causing much enthusiasm\nin the area of RF sensing, e.g., [4]–[9]. Similarly, in the\narea of vision, the widespread availability of affordable, high-\nresolution cameras has opened up new sensing possibilities for\nvarious applications.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nIn this paper, our first major goal\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nis to fundamentally\nunderstand the potential of everyday WiFi signals for neuro-\nlogical gait disorder diagnosis. While RF-based gait disorder\nanalysis has started to gain attraction in the literature, there\nare still very limited work in this area. For instance, existing\nWiFi-based ones either do not\ntest with real patients or\nhave only tested with a handful of patients, are limited in\nthe range of considered disorders, and are typically trained\nand tested in the same environment (i.e., not in the wild)\n[10], [11]. On the other hand, there are a small number of\npapers using radar signals for gait disorder assessment [12]–\n[14]. However, the majority of these studies are also afflicted\nby the previous limitations. More importantly, such work\nuse specialized equipment, which can be cost-prohibitive. In\ncontrast, a WiFi-based approach could offer a considerably\nmore economically viable alternative, with the potential to\ndemocratize access to healthcare. The next section provides\na detailed comparison with the prior work, with the key points\nfurther summarized in Table I.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the area of vision, on the other hand, there are more work\non gait disorder assessment with cameras, due to the preva-\nlence of video datasets that can be used for training/testing\npurposes. Yet, there are no apples-to-apples comparisons\nbetween WiFi and video-based systems – i.e., evaluations\nconducted under identical training and testing conditions and\nwith the same subjects. Such a comparison is crucially needed\nfor a proper integration of these systems in medical practices.\nOur second key objective is then to create a vision-based\ngait disorder system, mirroring the same subjects/conditions\nof our WiFi-based one, to facilitate a one-to-one performance\ncomparison.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.0**t== 1.0**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThis work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

One\nkey role the neurologists play is the visual assessment of the\ngait. Thus, the accurate duplication of this aspect by an RF-\nbased or a vision-based system holds promises for revolution-\nizing the diagnostic procedure. In other words, neurologists\nutilize many inputs (e.g., blood tests, genetic tests, etc) to\nestablish a diagnosis, in addition to a visual inspection of\nthe gait. However, many of these inputs can be collected\nmore easily (i.e., do not require the specialized expertise\nof neurologists) and integrated into a smart health system.\nThus, if a smart sensing system can replicate the complex\ntask of visual inspection, it has the potential to automate the\ndiagnostic process, reducing the burden on specialists, and\nenabling healthcare access for a larger population.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nHowever,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthere are no existing work on assessing the\ndiagnostic accuracy of neurologists if only relying on the\nvisual inspection of the gait, motivating our third goal. More\nspecifically, we design a large survey and disseminate it to 70\npracticing neurologists via partnership with Survey Healthcare\nGlobal (SHG) [15], in order to collect their performance when\nproviding a diagnosis only based on the visual inspection of\nthe gait. This then enables an apples-to-apples comparison\nwith both our WiFi-based and video-based systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe next explicitly discuss the contributions of the paper,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nfollowed by a detailed state-of-the-art comparison.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nStatement of Contributions:\n1. Through a partnership with neurologists, we provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of WiFi-based gait disorder assess-\nment by running a one-year-long clinical trial encom-\npassing 114 subjects and a wide range of disorders.\nThese conditions include Parkinson’s disease, Neuropathy,\nPost Stroke, Dementia, and Arthritis, in addition to healthy\nsubjects. The subjects further exhibit different degrees of\nseverity: mild, moderate, and severe. Finally, the testing is\ndone in the wild, i.e., in the doctor’s office. Beyond demon-\nstrating the performance of WiFi signals when detecting gait\ndisorders, the paper further comprehensively shows the impact\nof several different parameters (e.g., age, height, weight and\ndisease severity) on the performance. It additionally tests\nwith a few samples of other conditions (Amyotrophic Lateral\nSclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Spinal cord injury,\nNeurofibromatosis, and Dysferlinopathy), as well as cases with\nmultiple disorders. To the best of our knowledge, this paper\nserves as the first in-depth evaluation of WiFi’s capability\nin gait disorder assessment, with the potential to make a\nsignificant leap forward in the field.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n2. To ensure generalizability of our findings and further\nalleviate the extensive data collection required for training\npurposes, we have trained a neural network for RF-based\ngait disorder detection by mainly leveraging publicly-\naccessible online videos of gait disorders/healthy gaits.\nThis is enabled by our video-to-RF pipeline that converts\nsuch videos of a person’s walk to the corresponding synthetic\nRF data, as if the walk was performed near a pair of WiFi\ntransceivers.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nto-one comparison with a vision-based system, by further\ndeveloping a vision-based gait disorder assessment system\nthat uses identical subjects and conditions for both training\nand testing purposes. This side-by-side comparison is crucial\ntowards developing smart health systems and the first of its\nkind to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, as will be\ndemonstrated, the findings indicate comparable performance\nbetween the two modalities.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n4. In order to establish the diagnostic accuracy of neurolo-\ngists when only using visual inspection of the gait, we have\ndesigned a large video-based survey (based on the same pool\nof data) and have further partnered with Survey Healthcare\nGlobal (SHG), an entity that provides “measurable healthcare\nexpert opinions,” via recruitment and other tools, who then\ndisseminated our survey to 70 neurologists. We then contrast\nthe performance of our WiFi-based and video-based systems\nwith the diagnostic accuracy of neurologists when they base\ntheir evaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of\nits kind, which provides an apples-to-apples comparison\nof these three sensing modalities. As the results will show,\nboth WiFi and Video-based systems surpass the performance\nof neurologists when only using visual inspection of the gait.\nOverall, the findings of the paper can provide guidelines\nfor smart health system development, shape the integration of\nthese new sensing modalities into medical practice, and pave\nthe way toward equitable access to health. We note that our\nIRB committee has reviewed and approved this research.\nRemark 1: For brevity, in the rest of this paper, we refer\nto the Neurology Associates of Santa Barbara where the\nexperiments took place as The Neurology Center.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nII.

It further extensively compares\nthis work with state-of-the-art. A detailed summary of this\ncomparison is also provided in Table I for RF-based systems.\nThe prior work can be classified to three main categories:\nmethods utilizing floor/wearable sensors, video-based tech-\nniques, and RF-based approaches.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n1) Wearable and floor sensors: Accelerometers, gy-\nroscopes, and magnetometers have been recently used as\nfloor/wearable sensors for classifying neurological disorders\nthat have a gait manifestation [16]–[23]. These sensors are\ntypically attached to the body, e.g., smartwatches and insole\npressure sensors, or installed on the ground/treadmill, e.g.,\nforce plates.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOverall, while such recent work can be valuable in better\nunderstanding an abnormal gait pattern, incorporating them\ninto practice comes with significant drawbacks, such as limited\npublic accessibility (price and delivery), patient discomfort,\nand difficulty in use [24], [25].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2) Video-based Methods: With the increasing accessibility\nand advancements in computer vision techniques, utilizing\nvideo footage for gait disorder assessment has become a recent\narea of exploration [24]–[30].

Similarly, Ver-\nlekar et al. [29] use 2D footage of actors, for gait impair-\nment classification. Authors in [30] classify two gait-affecting\nneurodegenerative disorders: Parkinson’s and Hemiplegia, by\nutilizing a 3D Kinect sensor. On the other hand, [31] classifies\nhealthy vs. unhealthy gaits, considering 5 unhealthy gait\ndisorders that are acted out by 10 subjects.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn general, the video-based systems, while simpler-to-use as\ncompared to wearables, can raise privacy concerns and/or may\nnot be favorable for some patients that are not comfortable\nbeing camcorded. Furthermore, they require a line-of-sight\nview. Nevertheless, in addition to advancing the state-of-\nthe-art in the area of RF-based gait disorder assessment,\nthis paper further contributes to the area of vision-based\ngait assessment, as discussed next.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nIn general,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthere are more papers on vision-based gait\ndisorder assessment, as compared to RF-based approaches.\nHowever, a direct comparison between WiFi-based and vision-\nbased systems, under identical conditions and with the same\nsubjects, is currently lacking. Such a side-by-side methodical\ncomparison is important for providing guidelines on how\nsuch systems can be incorporated into the future smart health\necosystem. This paper thus contributes to the area of vision by\nproviding such a comparison. Furthermore, this paper contrasts\nthe performance of a vision-based system (as well as its WiFi-\nbased counterpart) with that of neurologists when they provide\na diagnosis solely based on the visual evaluation of the gait.\n3) RF-based Methods: Radio frequency-based gait disorder\nanalysis has recently gained attraction in the literature. How-\never, there are very limited number of work (six to the\nbest of our knowledge) on gait-disorder assessment using\nRF signals, as briefly summarized next. In [12], [13], IR-UWB\nand K-band radars are utilized to classify healthy vs. abnormal\ngait, while [14] utilizes a customized frequency-modulated\ncontinuous wave (FMCW) radar to detect Parkinson’s disease\nusing nocturnal breathing signals. When considering WiFi sig-\nnals, WiFreeze [11] aims to detect freeze of gait in Parkinson’s\npatients, while [32] and [10] classify unhealthy vs. healthy\ngaits. Less related to this work is Liu et al. [33], which does not\ndetect gait disorders, but analyzes the progress of Parkinson’s\ndisease using customized FMCW radio equipment. We next\ncompare our work with existing RF-based ones, as also\nsummarized in Table I.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nScope of evaluation: Half of the existing RF-based work\nhave not been tested with real patients, rather, the conditions\nhave been enacted [10], [13], [32].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFor those work that have tested with real patients [11],\n[12], [14], most collect a very small number of patients: 24\n(only 4 unhealthy) in [12] and 15 in [11]. [14] has collected\ndata of 53 subjects, albeit with customized radar equipment,\nand for detection based on breathing signals.

In this paper, we\nhave undertaken a comprehensive clinical campaign encom-\npassing 5 common gait disorders: Parkinson’s, arthritis, neu-\nropathy, post-stroke, and dementia, plus healthy. In addition,\nwe also test with the following conditions: Amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis (ALS), Multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury,\nNeurofibromatosis, and Dysferlinopathy, but at a smaller scale.\nTraining Data Collection Burden: All the existing work\n(except for [14] which uses breathing signals and customized\nFMCW radar) have manually collected RF training data, which\ncan be cumbersome and can result in non-generalizable results.\nThis work, however, mainly uses available online videos to\ngenerate synthetic RF data for training, thus significantly re-\nducing the training data collection burden and further ensuring\ngeneralizable results.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTesting in the Wild: Most existing work (all WiFi-based\nones) that collected data of real subjects train and test in the\nsame environment (using the same overall pool), potentially\nyielding non-generalizable results.

A PRIMER ON RF SIGNAL MODELING\nConsider a person walking in an area, in the vicinity of a\npair of WiFi transceivers, as shown in Fig. 1. The transmitter\nsends a signal, which bounces off of different parts of the\nbody of the person, as well as other objects in the envi-\nronment, and is received by the receiver. Then, the complex\nbaseband received signal can be written as: 𝑠rec(𝑡) = 𝛼s𝑒 𝑗 𝜃𝑠 +\n𝛼𝑖𝑒 𝑗 ( 2 𝜋\n𝜆 𝑑𝑖) , where 𝜆 is\n𝑙 ∈𝑉𝑠′\n𝛼𝑠′,𝑙𝑒 𝑗 𝜃𝑠′ ,𝑙 + 𝑖 ∈𝑉𝑏\nthe wavelength [34]. Moreover, 𝛼𝑖\nis the magnitude of the\nscattered signal from the 𝑖th body part whose velocity is\n𝑣𝑖 (𝑡), and 𝜓 = cos 𝜙𝑅 + cos 𝜙𝑇 , where 𝜙𝑅 and 𝜙𝑇 are the\nangles between the direction of motion and the vectors from\nthe transmitter and receiver to the body, respectively. 𝑑𝑖\nis\nthe initial length of the 𝑖th path, and 𝑉𝑏 is the set of body\npoints visible to both the receiver and the transmitter. The\nfirst and second terms then embrace the impact of the direct\npath and the reflections from static objects, respectively. We\nnote that at WiFi frequencies, and for the area dimensions\nconsidered in this paper, we have a far-field scenario. As such,\nwe took 𝜓 to be the same for all the body parts, as done in\nthe literature. The WiFi receiver, however, can only measure\nthe received signal magnitude or phase difference. We then\nnext summarize an approximated modeling of the received\nRF signal magnitude [34], [35]. More specifically, since the\nLOS path is much stronger than the other reflections, i.e.,\n|𝛼𝑠 | ≫ |𝛼𝑖 | and |𝛼𝑠 | ≫ |𝛼𝑠′,𝑙 |, for ∀𝑖, 𝑙, we have the following\nfor the received signal magnitude:\n∫\n∑︁\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\n|𝑠rec(𝑡)| ≈ 𝛾 +\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe first term, 𝛾 = 𝛼𝑠 + 𝑙 ∈𝑉𝑠′\n𝛼𝑠′,𝑙 cos(𝜃𝑠′,𝑙 − 𝜃𝑠), is static and\nremoved after DC removal, and the second term embraces the\ninformation of the moving body parts. A similar expression\ncan be derived for the phase difference signal.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIV. SYNTHETIC RF DATA GENERATION\nA proper training of a classifier requires extensive training\ndata. For WiFi sensing applications, however, WiFi sensing\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ndatasets pertaining to specific tasks of interest (e.g., gait\ndisorder classification in this paper) are not readily available.\nFurthermore, manual collection of such datasets can be pro-\nhibitive. In the area of vision, on the other hand, there is\nan abundance of vision dataset pertaining to many different\nscenarios. Thus, in recent years, there has been an interest\nin translating such vision datasets to synthetic RF training\ndatasets (albeit for other applications) [35]–[37].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this paper, we then utilize a publicly-available gait\ndisorder vision dataset of real subjects for generating synthetic\nRF training data. In this section, we set forth the details of our\npipeline for translating a vision input to a synthetic RF signal.\nAs we shall see, the typical human mesh recovery approaches\nin vision result in a 3D mesh that has a higher sampling rate for\ncertain body parts. This can then magnify the impact of those\nbody parts when generating synthetic RF signals. As such, in\nthis part, we also propose a new approach for remedying this\nissue. We next discuss the stpng in detail.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nA. Human Mesh Recovery\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nConsider a video of a person walking with a gait disor-\nder. We first utilize a state-of-the-art human mesh recovery\nalgorithm (HMR) to extract a 3D point cloud of the body for\neach frame [38]. However, the output 3D mesh generated by\nHMR is a non-uniform point cloud whose spatial density is\na function of the curvature of the body. In other words, the\nhigher the curvature of a body part, the more mesh points\nare allocated to it. Fig. 3 (a) shows an example of this where\nwe have utilized the state-of-the-art in HMR to translate a\nsnapshot of a walk into its 3D point cloud. We can see the\nzoomed-in mesh points for two body parts: the hands and the\nlegs, where hands are sampled much more heavily due to the\nhigh surface curvature. This can then result in the body parts\nwith higher curvatures contributing more than they truly would\nto the received signal. We next show how to address this issue\nusing 𝛼-shapes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nB. Finding 𝛼-Shapes of Human Mesh\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nHMR provides the 3D mesh as a set of discrete point cloud.\nWe then translate the points to non-overlapping sub-surfaces\nthat cover the whole body using 𝛼-shapes. The 𝛼-shape of a\nset of points is a polytope (not necessarily convex) that best\nfits the corresponding set [39]. It can thus be considered as\na generalization of convex hulls. By forming the 𝛼-shape of\nour given mesh points, we then effectively smooth out the\nimpact of non-uniform sampling and further generate a set of\nnon-overlapping triangular sub-surfaces, for wave simulation\npurposes. More specifically, we use the output body partitions\nprovided by HMR (e.g., torso, shoulder, etc.) and create the 𝛼-\nshape of each body part, using Delaunay triangulation. Fig. 3\n(b) shows the generated 𝛼-shapes for Fig. 3 (a). As seen, we\nnow have a set of sub-surfaces whose area is proportional to\nthe area of the corresponding body part, thus resolving the\noriginal high sampling rate issue.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nFig. 2.

Synthetic Wave Simulation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe finally simulate the interaction of the incoming wave\nwith the 3D human shape consisting of the 𝛼-shape-based sub-\nsurfaces of Sec. IV-B, with the transceivers as discussed in\nSec. IV-C, and by using the visibility assessment and scattering\nmodel of Sec.IV-D and IV-E, respectively. More specifically,\nby using Born approximation, we have [34], [35],\n∑︁\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\n𝑔(𝑃𝑇 𝑋, 𝑐𝑖)𝑅(𝑐𝑖)𝑔(𝑐𝑖, 𝑃𝑅𝑋)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n𝑠𝑟 = 𝑔(𝑃𝑇 𝑋, 𝑃𝑅𝑋) +\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 3.

Coordinate System Alignment\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nSince HMR provides its output in pixels, the 𝛼-shapes will\nalso be in pixels. By using the provided camera location and\nwalk distance from the video, we then translate the pixels\ninto meters. Finally, we place the resulting 3D human shape,\nconsisting of triangular sub-surfaces, in the vicinity of a pair\nof transceivers in a simulation environment, according to the\ndesired setup, to simulate the walking away motion [35].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nD. Visibility Assessment\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nLet 𝑐𝑖 and 𝑛𝑖 denote the center and normal vector of the 𝑖th\nsub-surface. We apply a visibility detection algorithm [40] to\nthe centers to find sub-surfaces visible to both the transmitter\nand receiver. With a finite sampling rate, this algorithm may\nmisclassify a small set of points [40]. To address this, we\nperform an additional step. Let ˆ𝑥 (𝑖)\n𝑅𝑋 denote the unit\nvector from the transmitter to 𝑐𝑖, and from 𝑐𝑖 to the receiver,\nrespectively. If ⟨ ˆ𝑥 (𝑖)\n𝑅𝑋, 𝑛𝑖⟩ is positive, then the 𝑖th\npoint will not be visible to the transceivers, where ⟨, ⟩ denotes\nthe inner product. We then remove all such points if still in\nthe output, thus further reducing the chance of false positives.\nWe denote the final visible set by 𝑉𝑏.\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.3**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\n𝑖𝑛𝑐, 𝑛𝑖⟩ or −⟨ ˆ𝑥 (𝑖)\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.3**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n𝑖𝑛𝑐 and ˆ𝑥 (𝑖)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nE.

Moreover, 𝐴𝑖 is the\narea of the 𝑖th sub-surface and 𝜃𝑖 is the angle between ˆ𝑥 (𝑖)\n𝑅𝑋 and\n𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑐. In this manner, 𝐴𝑖 cos(𝜃 (𝑖)\nˆ𝑥 (𝑖)\n𝑖𝑛𝑐) takes the effective area of\nthe 𝑖th surface into account.\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.3**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n𝐴𝑖 cos(𝜃 (𝑖)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhere 𝑔( 𝑝1, 𝑝2) =\nis the free space\nGreen’s function, 𝑅(𝑐𝑖) is the scattering coefficient of the 𝑖th\nsub-surface, and 𝑉𝑏 is the set of visible points.

CLINICAL TRIAL OF WIFI-BASED GAIT-DISORDER\nASSESSMENT: SETUP\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this section, we present the details of our one-year-\nlong clinical trial for testing the proposed pipeline. This is\nthen followed by Sec. VI, where we extensively show the\nperformance of the proposed pipeline when assessing the gait\nin The Neurology Center.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nA. Experiment Environment\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe have partnered with board-certified neurologists from\nThe Neurology Center, in order to extensively test our pro-\nposed pipeline with real patients exhibiting a variety of gait\ndisorders, and in a real office space. Through this partnership,\nthe clinic dedicated a 7m × 3.18m covered space to our\nexperiments, as shown in Fig. 4. We have then placed a pair\nof laptops in this area, where one acts as a WiFi transmitter\nand the other as a WiFi receiver.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs discussed in Sec. I, the system is envisioned to be used\nin smart health settings (e.g., smart home setting). As such,\npatients should be asked to walk the most meaningful route\nfor the assessment, which is the one perpendicular to the line\nconnecting the transmitter and receiver. Then, the patients are\nasked to walk back and forth two times, starting from the\nmarked start point to the marked end point. We note that we\ndo not have any control over how the patients walk, and as\nsuch, they can deviate from a straight path at times. We finally\nnote that the route is not marked on the ground from the start\nto the endpoint, as enforcing walking on a marked route can\naffect how the patients walk, and can thus obscure the gait\ndisorder. We then place the transmitter and receiver 64cm apart\n(std=16cm), and at the height of 1.1m (std=5cm). The distance\nfrom the start point to the link connecting the transmitter and\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 4.

Then, the patients are asked to\nwalk back and forth two times, from the start point to the end\npoint, where each one-way is 3.9m (std=0.1m). We note that\nthe observed slight variability in these parameters is due to\nthe restrictions from The Neurology Center on leaving behind\nfloor markers/equipment.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nRemark 2: In this paper, a gait sample refers to a one-way\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nwalk from start to end in Fig. 4, or vice versa.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nB.

We note that the uneven distribution of the\nnumbers across conditions partly mirrors the visit frequency\nof each class to the clinic.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe further note that the participants may experience differ-\nent degrees of disease severity, which can affect the sensing\nperformance. We extensively discuss such impacts in the next\nsection. Finally, we note that we have also collected additional\ndata from subjects suffering from other conditions, or multiple\nsimultaneous conditions, as detailed in the next section.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIt is important to collect the data of healthy subjects in\nthe same environment for consistency. As such, the healthy\nindividuals are recruited from the following groups: patients\nwho visited the clinic for other neurological issues that do not\nhave a gait manifestation (mainly from migraine patients), the\ncompanions of the patients, and the staff of The Neurology\nCenter, among others.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs mentioned earlier, most patients walked back and forth\ntwo times. We then only use those parts where the participant\nwalks away from the link as it is indicated to have a better\nsignal quality [34]. This then amounts to two gait samples for\nmost patients, each of which then independently contributes\nto the overall test pool. Overall, 101 subjects amounted to a\ntotal of 204 gait samples.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nD.

Once\na patient agrees to take part in our medical trials, he/she then\nwalks back and forth a couple of times in the area of Fig. 4,\nas detailed in Section V-A. The collected data are then stored\nin an anonymized manner (using an identification code), and\nthe ground-truth gait diagnosis is provided to us by the doctor.\nWe note that our Institutional Review Board (IRB)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncommittee has reviewed and approved this research.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nE.

Neurologists utilize many inputs to\nestablish a diagnosis, in addition to a visual inspection. These\ncan include: the results from vision and speech assessment,\nsensory perception and mental status evaluations, brain scans,\ngenetic and blood tests, cerebro-spinal fluid analysis, and elec-\ntroencephalography [43]. Our medical partners then furnish\nus with their definitive diagnosis for each patient, which we\nthen adopt as the ground-truth. In addition, the doctor provide\nus with their assessment of the severity of each condition,\ncategorizing it as mild, moderate, or severe.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nF. WiFi Data Collection and Processing\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe use a pair of laptops equipped with an Intel 5300\nWLAN card as transceivers to collect the WiFi data (See\nFig. 4). While the patient is walking, the transmitter sends\n500 packets/second in channel 64 with a center frequency\nof 5.32 GHz. For each of the three receiving antennas, the\nchannel state information (CSI) of 30 sub-carriers and the\nsubsequent signal magnitude is obtained using CSI Tool [44],\nresulting in 90 data streams. We then denoise the data by\napplying Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For each PCA\ncomponent, a spectrogram is generated using a combination\nof multi-window Hermite functions and STFT, based on a\nwindow of size 0.3 seconds and a time shift of 16 ms [34].\nThe final spectrogram is then generated by averaging over the\nfirst 15 spectrograms.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nG.

This\ndataset has side-view perspective of the subjects, which is\nmost informative for HMR [38]. We note that there are no\npublicly-available dataset for the other three gait disorders\nof interest to this paper. However, this has little impact on\nour performance as we shall see in the next section. Each\nsubject then contributes to two gait samples (except for one\nperson), amounting to a total video dataset of 155 gait samples:\nParkinson’s (26), arthritis (70), and healthy (59).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDuring their visit to the center, the patients are handed out a\npamphlet that details the purpose of the study, the procedure,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe then apply the proposed pipeline of Fig. 2 to each\nvideo.

We then apply the 𝛼-shape algorithm [39] to each body\npart individually, to generate the sub-surfaces. For each body\npart, we set a fixed 𝛼-radius, which we empirically optimize\nby utilizing a small number of videos. In general, the smaller\nthe body part, the smaller the 𝛼-shape radius should be.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nAfter generating the sub-surfaces, we set\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthe WiFi\ntransceivers in a simulation environment, according to the\nconfiguration of Fig. 4, in order to simulate the synthetic\nRF data that would have been generated if the person in the\nvideo was in a WiFi area. We then apply the wave simulator\nof Sec. IV, using the reflection model of Sec. IV-E and\nvisibility assessment of Sec. IV-D. To empirically optimize\nand set the parameters for 𝑚, 𝛼, and 𝛽 of this simulator,\nwe simultaneously collect\nthe WiFi and video data of 2\nparticipants, one with normal and one with an abnormal gait,\nwhich are then only used for this purpose (not in training\nor testing). Overall, the end-to-end pipeline results in 155\nsynthetic RF gait samples of 78 subjects.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nH. Spectrogram Generation and Feature Extraction\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor each RF training data sample, we generate its spectro-\ngram using a combination of multi-window Hermite functions\nand STFT [34]. We note that we only consider the central 50%\ntime span of each walk, in order to remove the acceleration and\ndeceleration parts as well as any other unrelated movements\nat the onset or conclusion of the activity. We then extract six\nfeatures from each spectrogram for training a machine learning\npipeline, as discussed next.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn order to find the torso speed, we first sum the spectrogram\nover frequency for each time instant. We next obtain the\nshortest frequency window where the sum of the spectrogram\nvalues is greater than 50% of the overall sum (for each\ntime step). This leads to two distinct curves that mark the\nlower and upper boundaries of the resultant frequency band.\nWe then remove the outliers using the generalized extreme\nstudentized deviate (GESD) test, and smooth the curves by\nrunning a moving average over 4 samples. Finally, we apply\nthe same 50% method to the obtained spectrogram band and\naverage the upper and lower bound curves to get the torso\nspeed. We then find the following six features accordingly:\nAverage torso speed: This is the average of the torso speed\nover time; Minimum and maximum of torso speed: We\ncalculate the minimum and maximum speed of the torso from\nits speed curve; Gait Cycle: This is obtained by finding the\npeak values (at least 0.3 seconds apart) in the autocorrelation\nfunction of the torso speed [34], [46]; Step Length: We\ncalculate the average step length, which is the stride time\n(half of gait cycle) times the average torso speed [34]; Torso\nspeed variations: We obtain the average difference between\nthe maximum torso speed (90% percentile) and minimum torso\nspeed (10% percentile) across all stpng [34].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nI. Training a Gait Disorder Classifier for WiFi-based Sensing\nWe train a feed-forward, fully connected multi-layer percep-\ntron (MLP) neural network with two hidden layers for WiFi-\nbased gait disorder detection, given the features of Sec. V-H,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nand by using the generated synthetic video-to-RF data of 78\nsubjects. The hidden layers have 512 and 256 nodes, respec-\ntively. The dropout layers are applied to both hidden layers\nwith the parameter 0.5. We utilize ReLU as the activation\nfunction for the hidden layers and softmax function at the\noutput layer. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00001\nand a weighted cross-entropy loss function is then used to train\nthe network for 100 epochs, with a batch size of 10.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nJ. Domain Adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe synthetic RF training data is generated from videos.\nThus, it not only is a completely different modality, but it also\nnaturally encompasses different subjects and environments as\ncompared to those used in testing. These two factors result in\nthe well-known domain and distribution shift problem between\nthe training and test samples in machine learning [47]. To\naddress this, we use WiFi data of 12 subjects (6 healthy, 3\nParkinson’s, and 3 arthritis) to re-weigh the loss function via an\nexhaustive search that aims to maximize the overall system’s\naverage accuracy for this small dataset. We then repeat the\nsearch process ten times and declare the median of the weight\nas the final value. To ensure robustness, the gait assessment’s\noverall performance during testing is then averaged over 8\nrandom sampling of the 12 domain-adaptation subjects, out\nof the collected WiFi data of 101 subjects, while the rest 89\nsubjects are left for testing in each round.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe next extensively discuss the performance of the pro-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nposed pipeline with real patients.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nVI. CLINICAL TRIAL OF WIFI-BASED GAIT-DISORDER\nASSESSMENT: PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this section, we present and analyze the outcomes of our\none-year-long clinical trial in The Neurology Center, involving\n114 subjects. Our analysis is comprehensive as it covers\nvarious different gait conditions. We further show the impact\nof the severity of the disease on the classification accuracy,\nin addition to demonstrating the impact of age, height, and\nweight on WiFi-based sensing of gait disorder. Moreover, we\nshow the performance of our system with other gait conditions\nsuch as ALS, spinal cord injury, dysferlinopathy, and multiple\nsclerosis, and demonstrate how they are mainly classified\nas unhealthy. We finally show the results when testing with\npatients that suffer from multiple gait conditions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOverall, the results shed light on the feasibility of these\nsignals for detecting gait disorders and can provide guidance\non how they can be incorporated into future health systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nA. Overall Performance\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this part, we discuss the performance of our classifier\nwhen tested with 101 subjects. More specifically, the overall\naverage per subject accuracy of this classifier is 85.61%,\nwith an average per class accuracy of 85.47%, with the\nfollowing breakdown over the two classes: unhealthy (85.8%)\nand healthy (85.13%). Fig. 5 further shows the average classifi-\ncation accuracy per condition. As can be seen, the performance\nis mostly consistent per condition. The lower performance for\nsome conditions (e.g., Parkinson’s) can be largely attributed to\n**BLOCK**fs== 6.4**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTABLE II\nIMPACT OF DISEASE SEVERITY ON CORRECTLY CLASSIFYING IT AS\nUNHEALTHY.

Other Gait Conditions\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe next show the performance of the WiFi-based sensing\nsystem when evaluating subjects with other conditions. To-\nwards this goal, we additionally collect WiFi test data for\npatients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (1 subject),\nmultiple sclerosis (MS) (3 subjects), spinal cord injury (2\nsubjects), neurofibromatosis (1 subject), and dysferlinopathy\n(1 subject) amounting to a total of 8 subjects and 20 gait sam-\nples. It is worth emphasizing that these conditions are not seen\nduring training or domain adaptation. We then feed these to our\naforementioned classifier. The system was able to classify all\nthese cases as unhealthy except for two patients, one with ALS\n(always misclassified) and the other with Neurofibromatosis\n(one of his/her sample walks was accurately classified in 2\nout of the eight random samplings of domain adaptation-test\nselections while the other was always misclassified).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOverall, this shows the potential of the system to extend to\nunseen conditions. To improve the accuracy, sample data of\nthese cases can also be included during training and/or domain\nadaptation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nE. Cases with Multiple Conditions\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSome patients may suffer from multiple gait-related condi-\ntions. It is thus important to evaluate the performance of our\nclassifier for such cases. Towards this goal, we have further\nrecruited 5 patients who suffer from multiple conditions:\narthritis and neuropathy (1 patient), dementia and post-stroke\n(1 patient), Parkinson’s and neuropathy (1 patient), Parkinson’s\nand Dementia (1 patient), arthritis, neuropathy and spinal cord\ninjury (1 patient) amounting to a total of 10 gait samples.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAll these patients were classified as unhealthy by our clas-\nsifier except for the person with Parkinson’s and neuropathy\n(one sample walk is accurately classified in half of the domain\nadaption-test selections while the other is accurately classified\nonly in 1 out of 8 selections). Overall, this shows the robust\nperformance of the system even in classifying cases with\nmultiple conditions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nVII. GAIT DISORDER CLASSIFICATION BASED ON\nVIDEOS\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nIn this paper, our goal\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nis to provide a comprehensive\ninvestigation of gait disorder sensing with different modalities.\nTowards this goal, we next delve into developing a video-\nbased gait disorder classifier. While there are a number of\nvideo-based gait disorder classifiers, as surveyed in Sec. II, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 5.\nPerformance of our WiFi-based system in correctly classifying\nunhealthy/healthy gaits of 101 subjects in The Neurology Center, with a\nperformance breakdown over each condition. It can be seen that the system\ncan robustly classify unhealthy/healthy gaits when tested extensively with real\nsubjects, with an overall per subject accuracy of 85.61%, although the system\nis mainly trained on synthetic data generated from online videos.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthe disparate distribution of disease severity across conditions,\nor to how differently these conditions manifest in gait.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nB. Impact of Disease Severity\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe severity of a gait disorder can play a key role in its\nidentification, with the expectation that more severe cases\nhave a more clear gait manifestation, making it easier to\nclassify them. We next show the impact of disease severity\non the classification accuracy. To establish ground truth, The\nNeurology Center has categorized each case as mild, moderate,\nor severe. Table II subsequently presents the breakdown of\nthe probability of correct classification (as unhealthy) based\non disease severity, for the unhealthy gait conditions. As can\nbe seen, the accuracy increases as the severity of the disease\nincreases, as expected.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nC. Impact of Age, Weight, and Height\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThis section provides a demographic breakdown of the\nperformance of the proposed classifier, across different age\ngroups, genders, body weights, and heights. As seen in Fig.\n6 (a) and (b), the system shows a consistent performance\nover different ranges of heights and weights. Similarly, the\nclassifier attained an accuracy of 86.61% for individuals self-\nidentifying as males and 84.83% for those self-identifying\nas females, demonstrating its capability to accurately classify\nparticipants across gender lines. On the other hand, Fig. 6\n(c) illustrates enhanced performance in classifying older or\nyounger participants, with a notable decline in the accuracy for\nmiddle-aged individuals. We can attribute the observed pattern\nto the fact that the older subjects typically exhibit more severe\nsymptoms, while the younger group predominantly constitute\nhealthy cases. Meanwhile, the middle-aged cohort generally\nexhibit symptoms that are less severe than those of older\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nImpact of (a) height, (b) weight, and (c) age on WiFi-based gait disorder assessment.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nresults of this section are important for the following reason.\nIn order to effectively compare the performance of WiFi and\nvideo-based methods, it is crucial to test them under the same\nexact conditions (same subjects, environment, etc). In other\nwords, they should be compared based on concurrent video\nand WiFi recordings of the same subjects. This is important\nsince variability of the subjects can impact the severity of the\nunderlying condition, and variability of the location/time can\nalso result in different sensing qualities, preventing derivations\nof meaningful conclusions. We next lay out the details of our\nvision-based system and compare it with the previous WiFi-\nbased pipeline.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTraining Dataset: We use the same exact publicly-available\nonline video dataset, used for generating synthetic RF data in\nSec. V-G, for training the vision-based system.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTest Subjects: For the purpose of testing, we need to\nconcurrently collect videos of the same subjects that are used\nfor testing the WiFi pipeline. The patient recruitment process\nis as described in Sec. V-D, where the patients have the option\nof participating in only WiFi data collection, or both video and\nWiFi. For those who agree to both, we then collect their video\nand WiFi simultaneously, with the video being recorded from\nthe side since it is the most informative for mesh recovery\n(all online videos are side-views as well). The videos are then\nrecorded using an ultra-wide lens setting, with an aperture\nof f/2.4 and a 120-degree field of view, at a frame rate of\n30 frames per second. We note that the scattered WiFi signals\nfrom the tripod and camera are filtered during the DC removal\nphase, thus not affecting the WiFi pipeline. Finally, we note\nthat our Institutional Review Board (IRB) committee has\nalso reviewed and approved the video collection process.\nFeature Extraction and Training: The parameters we have\nused as features in the vision-based system are the same as\nthose utilized in our WiFi pipeline. More specifically, we use\nthe middle 50% of each walk to exclude the acceleration and\ndeceleration parts. We then generate the 3D point cloud of the\nbody for each frame, which we then partition into 14 parts\n(hands, legs, torso, etc.). The average position of the points\nassociated with each part results in 14 key points. We obtain\nthe average, minimum (10% percentile), and maximum (90%\npercentile) of the torso speed as our first three features. To\nextract the gait cycle, we analyze the vertical position curves\nof each foot separately and over time. We then filter out the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nfrequencies higher than 4 Hz to remove noise (the cadence\nfor a fast run is around 180 strides/minute, which gives a\ngait cycle frequency of 1.5 Hz). Subsequently, we determine\nthe gait cycle by computing the time difference between the\nextrema (at least 0.25 seconds apart) on each curve. Finally,\nwe use the average of two gait cycles as the overall gait cycle,\nwhich serves as our fourth feature. It is worth mentioning that\nif, due to the noise of HMR and lack of visibility of one foot,\nthe algorithm cannot extract the gait cycle from one foot, we\nonly consider the gait cycle of the other foot. Finally, the step\nlength and torso speed variations are obtained similar to our\nWiFi pipeline.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nUsing these 6 features, we then train a fully connected\nneural network with two hidden layers, while keeping all the\nspecifications identical to the WiFi system (see Sec. V-I). For\ntraining, we have the same exact subjects and associated walk\nsamples as in the video-to-RF training dataset of Sec. V-G.\nWe note that while we had 101 subjects for WiFi testing in\nSec. VI-A, we only have consents from 72 of those subjects\nfor video recording. As such, later in this section, we will also\nfurther report the performance of the WiFi system with only\nthose subjects as well, for a fair comparison.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nMore specifically, we have the following breakdown over\nthe 72 subjects: Parkinson’s disease (12), dementia (8), post-\nstroke (11), arthritis (hip or knee, 4), neuropathy (6), and\nhealthy (31), totaling 293 test gait samples (average of 49\ngait samples per condition). We note that we use both back\nand forth of the walks here as they both present informative\nside-views for a vision-based system. We then use the same\nnumber of patients/conditions for domain adaptation (12 total),\nas described for the WiFi pipeline. The overall performance\nis then averaged over 8 random sampling of the 60 subjects\nout of the overall pool of 72 subjects.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nPerformance Analysis: Fig. 7 summarizes the breakdown\nof the performance over different conditions, for our video-\nbased classifier. Moreover,\nthe overall average per subject\naccuracy of this classifier is 83.80%, with an average per class\naccuracy of 84.37%, with the following breakdown over the\ntwo classes: unhealthy (81.09%) and healthy (87.64%). As\nexplained for the WiFi case, the variability of the performance\namong the conditions can be mainly attributed to the disparate\ndistribution of disease severity across different conditions, or\nto different gait manifestation of the conditions.

It is worth noting that this is the first\nof such a study, to the best of our knowledge.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTowards this goal, we have designed a survey in Qualtrics\n[48]. Our survey is comprehensive, going beyond binary\nclassification of the gait, which we shall discuss extensively in\nthe next section. In this section, we discuss a part of the survey\nthat facilitates comparison with our developed WiFi and video-\nbased systems. Consider 72 questions (12 per each condition\non average). Each question shows a video of a patient’s gait\nand requests a diagnosis by selecting their top three preferred\noptions from a list of six conditions of interest to this paper\n(the same choice can be made for the top three as well). The\nvideos are from the same subjects used for testing our video-\nbased system for an apples-to-apples comparison. We have\nfurther partnered with Survey Healthcare Global (SHG), an\nentity that provides “measurable healthcare expert opinions,”\nvia recruitment and other tools [15], who then disseminated\nour survey to their pool of certified neurologists. In total,\nwe have received an average of 197 responses per condition\nfrom 70 neurologists, for each of the 6 conditions of interest\nto this paper (5 gait disorders + healthy). To evaluate the\nperformance of neurologists in diagnosing gait-related condi-\ntions, we calculate a binary classification accuracy (healthy vs.\nunhealthy) similar to the proposed WiFi or video systems. For\nthis purpose, an answer is accurate if a neurologist identifies\na healthy (unhealthy) subject as healthy (unhealthy) in their\nfirst choice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTable III shows the results for each class (healthy and\nunhealthy) and the average per-class accuracy. It is interest-\ning to observe that both WiFi and video-based systems\nexhibit slightly superior performance compared to that of\nneurologists, when they only use visual inspection. This is\nimportant as it has implications for how WiFi or video-based\nsystems can be incorporated into a smart health system. As\ndiscussed in Sec. II, neurologists utilize many inputs when\nestablishing a medical diagnosis. Nevertheless, some of these\ninputs can be easily collected and integrated with a WiFi or\nvideo-based sensing system. Such a system can then provide\nhealthcare for a larger population, and can collaborate with\nneurologists as needed.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nIX.

Can RF Signals Differentiate Neurological Disorders?\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThus far, we have developed a WiFi-based gait disorder\nassessment system that can classify the gait into healthy and\nunhealthy. The natural next step would be to see if such signals\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 7.

However, it can raise privacy\nconcerns or may not be favorable for some patients, motivating\nthe use of RF signals.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWiFi-based vs. Video-based: Fig. 5 and 7 show the results\nof WiFi and video-based, respectively. However, as mentioned\nearlier, we did not have consents of all the 101 subjects for\nvideo recording. As such, while the two systems are trained\non the same exact online video subjects, our video pipeline\nthus far is tested on 72 subjects while the WiFi is tested on\na bigger set of 101 subjects. For a fair comparison, here we\nreport the performance of the WiFi system when only tested on\nthe same exact 72 subjects, while ensuring the same random\nsampling and domain-adaptation process. This results in an\naverage per class accuracy of 84.41%, unhealthy (83.03%)\nand healthy (85.78%), with an overall average per subject\naccuracy of 84.19%. We can see that this does not impact the\nperformance of the WiFi system, as compared to the results\nof Sec. VI-A, since the number of subjects is high. When\ncomparing this WiFi’s performance with that of the video,\nwe can see that they are comparable. This is promising as it\nindicates the potential of WiFi for capturing gait disorders. It\nalso creates the potential for multi-modality sensing, as we\ndiscuss in Sec. IX-C. To the best of our knowledge this is\nthe first result that compares the performance of WiFi and\nvideo when capturing gait disorders, using the same exact\nsubjects/conditions. Such an apples-to-apples comparison is\nimportant for establishing meaningful conclusions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nVIII.

II, neurologists rely on many inputs,\nin addition to a visual inspection of the gait, to establish a diag-\nnosis. In this paper, we have thus far shown the performance\nof gait disorder classification based on the information gait\ninduces in the WiFi signal (or in a video). It is thus fitting\nto find the performance of neurologists when diagnosing a\n**BLOCK**fs== 6.4**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTABLE IV\nNEUROLOGISTS’ ACCURACY WHEN DIAGNOSING SOLELY BASED ON THE\nVISUAL INSPECTION OF THE GAIT, WITH AN AVERAGE PER CONDITION\nACCURACY OF 30.89%.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWhile considerably challenging, considering very mild cases\ncan also be another interesting research avenue.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nCondition\nArthritis\nHealthy\nDementia\nNeuropathy\nParkinson’s\nPost-stroke\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nTop-1 Acc.\n18.63%\n65.95%\n14.70%\n9.35%\n35.15%\n41.55%\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nTop-2 Acc.\n39.83%\n73.12%\n30.58%\n23.17%\n43.00%\n51.2%\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\nTop-3 Acc.\n51.04%\n80.39%\n44.29%\n40.78%\n48.11%\n57.19%\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nare capable of not only identifying an unhealthy gait but\nalso categorizing it to the specific underlying disorder. While\nthere are several work on WiFi signals classifying different\nactivities, such activities typical have a sizable footprint on\nthe received signal. Exploring the efficacy of these signals\nin classifying gait disorders thus remains a subject of future\nexploration. It is worth noting that there are work in the area\nof vision on classifying the underlying disorder. It would be\ninteresting to see how an RF-based system compares, and\nfurther expand the scope of the vision-based systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nB. Experts’ Accuracy Based on Visual Inspection – Classifi-\ncation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs outlined earlier, we conducted an extensive survey to\nevaluate the diagnostic accuracy of neurologists when rely-\ning solely on visual gait inspection. In Sec. VIII, we then\ndetailed its findings regarding the classification of gait as\neither unhealthy or healthy. Here, we discuss the results when\nneurologists classify gait into one of the six conditions of\nto this paper. This is important as it provides a\ninterest\nbenchmark for future RF-based work that aims to further\nclassify the gait disorder to its underlying condition. Table\nIV summarizes the results, with an overall average accuracy\nof 30.89% per condition. These initial results indicate the\nimportance of the other inputs (discussed in Sec. V-E) that\nare part of the diagnostic process, which have the potential\nto be more easily collected, and integrated with an RF-based\nor a video-based sensing system. Finally, it is noteworthy that\ndespite using the identical dataset as in Fig. 7, the conditions\nchallenging for assessment differ when assessed by humans.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nC. Other Improvements\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn this paper, we only used one sample walk instance of the\nsubject. Using more walk samples or a longer walk duration\ncan further improve the performance. Moreover, we have used\nonly 6 features for training the network, for both our WiFi\nand video-based systems. Additionally, the same 6 features\nare used for both systems for consistency. As part of future\nwork, more features can be utilized and further tailored to\neach sensing modality. Also, a multi-modal WiFi and video-\nbased system can be developed to increase the robustness.\nIn addition, using more samples of different gait disorders\nfor training can also improve the quality. For instance, we\nhave only used samples of two gait disorders (plus healthy)\nduring training/domain adaptation. Finally, in terms of disease\nseverity, we only considered mild, moderate and severe cases.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nD. Towards Equitable Healthcare\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAn important future direction would be to integrate addi-\ntional medical inputs (e.g., patient intake information, blood\ntests, brain scans) with the collected RF (or video) sensing\ndata. Given that some of these inputs can be collected more\neasily (do not require expertise of neurologists), a successful\nintegration can hold promise for an automated smart health\nsystem, paving the way towards equitable healthcare.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nX. CONCLUSIONS\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this paper, we reported on the findings of a one-year-long\nclinical trial for gait disorder assessment. More specifically, we\ndeveloped the first WiFi-based gait disorder sensing system of\nits kind, distinguished by its scope of validation with a large\nand diverse patient cohort. To ensure generalizability, our sys-\ntem was mainly trained on synthetic RF data, converted from\npublicly-available videos of gait disorders, via developing a\nvideo-to-RF pipeline. We further developed a vision-based gait\ndisorder assessment system under the same exact conditions,\nand provided the first apples-to-apples comparison between\nthe WiFi-based and video-based ones. We finally contrasted\nboth systems with the accuracy of neurologists when basing\nevaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait. Overall,\nthe results can play a key role for the proper integration of\nthese sensing modalities into medical practice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nREFERENCES\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n[1] P.

         " Gait Disorder Assessment Based on   a Large-Scale Clinical Trial:   WiFi vs. Video vs. Doctor’s Visual Inspection   Alireza Parsay*, Mert Torun*, Philip R. Delio, and Yasamin Mostofi   N EUROLOGICAL gait disorders affect 24% of adults   ages 60 and older, with the number increasing to 55% above the age of 80 [1]. In general, gait disorders can be devastating to the mobility, independence, cognition, and self- esteem of an individual, as many studies have shown [2]. As such, proper diagnosis is crucial for giving the individual proper care that can optimize their well-being. Yet, many individuals may not seek medical help, or may seek it only   after the disease has progressed [2]. Furthermore, once medical help is sought, many patients miss follow-up appointments [3]. The situation can be much worse in impoverished/developing nations (or even in rural areas within the United States) as families can face additional challenges in accessing healthcare due to prohibitive costs, extended waiting time for specialist consultations, or the general scarcity of medical expertise.   On the other hand, other promising sensing modalities have emerged over the past few years. For instance, wireless signals, now ubiquitous, have created new opportunities for sensing and learning about the environment, causing much enthusiasm in the area of RF sensing, e.g., [4]–[9]. Similarly, in the area of vision, the widespread availability of affordable, high- resolution cameras has opened up new sensing possibilities for various applications.   In this paper, our first major goal   is to fundamentally understand the potential of everyday WiFi signals for neuro- logical gait disorder diagnosis. While RF-based gait disorder analysis has started to gain attraction in the literature, there are still very limited work in this area. For instance, existing WiFi-based ones either do not test with real patients or have only tested with a handful of patients, are limited in the range of considered disorders, and are typically trained and tested in the same environment (i.e., not in the wild) [10], [11]. On the other hand, there are a small number of papers using radar signals for gait disorder assessment [12]– [14]. However, the majority of these studies are also afflicted by the previous limitations. More importantly, such work use specialized equipment, which can be cost-prohibitive. In contrast, a WiFi-based approach could offer a considerably more economically viable alternative, with the potential to democratize access to healthcare. The next section provides a detailed comparison with the prior work, with the key points further summarized in Table I.   In the area of vision, on the other hand, there are more work on gait disorder assessment with cameras, due to the preva- lence of video datasets that can be used for training/testing purposes. Yet, there are no apples-to-apples comparisons between WiFi and video-based systems – i.e., evaluations conducted under identical training and testing conditions and with the same subjects. Such a comparison is crucially needed for a proper integration of these systems in medical practices. Our second key objective is then to create a vision-based gait disorder system, mirroring the same subjects/conditions of our WiFi-based one, to facilitate a one-to-one performance comparison.   Finally, a successful integration of such sensing modalities in a smart healthcare system requires rigorous benchmarking against the diagnostic performance of medical experts. One key role the neurologists play is the visual assessment of the gait. Thus, the accurate duplication of this aspect by an RF- based or a vision-based system holds promises for revolution- izing the diagnostic procedure. In other words, neurologists utilize many inputs (e.g., blood tests, genetic tests, etc) to establish a diagnosis, in addition to a visual inspection of the gait. However, many of these inputs can be collected more easily (i.e., do not require the specialized expertise of neurologists) and integrated into a smart health system. Thus, if a smart sensing system can replicate the complex task of visual inspection, it has the potential to automate the diagnostic process, reducing the burden on specialists, and enabling healthcare access for a larger population.   there are no existing work on assessing the diagnostic accuracy of neurologists if only relying on the visual inspection of the gait, motivating our third goal. More specifically, we design a large survey and disseminate it to 70 practicing neurologists via partnership with Survey Healthcare Global (SHG) [15], in order to collect their performance when providing a diagnosis only based on the visual inspection of the gait. This then enables an apples-to-apples comparison with both our WiFi-based and video-based systems.   We next explicitly discuss the contributions of the paper,   followed by a detailed state-of-the-art comparison.   Statement of Contributions: 1. Through a partnership with neurologists, we provide a comprehensive analysis of WiFi-based gait disorder assess- ment by running a one-year-long clinical trial encom- passing 114 subjects and a wide range of disorders. These conditions include Parkinson’s disease, Neuropathy, Post Stroke, Dementia, and Arthritis, in addition to healthy subjects. The subjects further exhibit different degrees of severity: mild, moderate, and severe. Finally, the testing is done in the wild, i.e., in the doctor’s office. Beyond demon- strating the performance of WiFi signals when detecting gait disorders, the paper further comprehensively shows the impact of several different parameters (e.g., age, height, weight and disease severity) on the performance. It additionally tests with a few samples of other conditions (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Spinal cord injury, Neurofibromatosis, and Dysferlinopathy), as well as cases with multiple disorders. To the best of our knowledge, this paper serves as the first in-depth evaluation of WiFi’s capability in gait disorder assessment, with the potential to make a significant leap forward in the field.   2. To ensure generalizability of our findings and further alleviate the extensive data collection required for training purposes, we have trained a neural network for RF-based gait disorder detection by mainly leveraging publicly- accessible online videos of gait disorders/healthy gaits. This is enabled by our video-to-RF pipeline that converts such videos of a person’s walk to the corresponding synthetic RF data, as if the walk was performed near a pair of WiFi transceivers.   to-one comparison with a vision-based system, by further developing a vision-based gait disorder assessment system that uses identical subjects and conditions for both training and testing purposes. This side-by-side comparison is crucial towards developing smart health systems and the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, as will be demonstrated, the findings indicate comparable performance between the two modalities.   4. In order to establish the diagnostic accuracy of neurolo- gists when only using visual inspection of the gait, we have designed a large video-based survey (based on the same pool of data) and have further partnered with Survey Healthcare Global (SHG), an entity that provides “measurable healthcare expert opinions,” via recruitment and other tools, who then disseminated our survey to 70 neurologists. We then contrast the performance of our WiFi-based and video-based systems with the diagnostic accuracy of neurologists when they base their evaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind, which provides an apples-to-apples comparison of these three sensing modalities. As the results will show, both WiFi and Video-based systems surpass the performance of neurologists when only using visual inspection of the gait. Overall, the findings of the paper can provide guidelines for smart health system development, shape the integration of these new sensing modalities into medical practice, and pave the way toward equitable access to health. We note that our IRB committee has reviewed and approved this research. Remark 1: For brevity, in the rest of this paper, we refer to the Neurology Associates of Santa Barbara where the experiments took place as The Neurology Center.   This section reviews emerging sensing systems for gait- based neurological disorders. It further extensively compares this work with state-of-the-art. A detailed summary of this comparison is also provided in Table I for RF-based systems. The prior work can be classified to three main categories: methods utilizing floor/wearable sensors, video-based tech- niques, and RF-based approaches.   1) Wearable and floor sensors: Accelerometers, gy- roscopes, and magnetometers have been recently used as floor/wearable sensors for classifying neurological disorders that have a gait manifestation [16]–[23]. These sensors are typically attached to the body, e.g., smartwatches and insole pressure sensors, or installed on the ground/treadmill, e.g., force plates.   Overall, while such recent work can be valuable in better understanding an abnormal gait pattern, incorporating them into practice comes with significant drawbacks, such as limited public accessibility (price and delivery), patient discomfort, and difficulty in use [24], [25].   2) Video-based Methods: With the increasing accessibility and advancements in computer vision techniques, utilizing video footage for gait disorder assessment has become a recent area of exploration [24]–[30]. For instance, [26] develops an R-CNN-based classifier to distinguish between healthy and   Parkinsonian gaits, while [28] performs classification (health vs. unhealthy), based on 2D pose estimation. Similarly, Ver- lekar et al. [29] use 2D footage of actors, for gait impair- ment classification. Authors in [30] classify two gait-affecting neurodegenerative disorders: Parkinson’s and Hemiplegia, by utilizing a 3D Kinect sensor. On the other hand, [31] classifies healthy vs. unhealthy gaits, considering 5 unhealthy gait disorders that are acted out by 10 subjects.   In general, the video-based systems, while simpler-to-use as compared to wearables, can raise privacy concerns and/or may not be favorable for some patients that are not comfortable being camcorded. Furthermore, they require a line-of-sight view. Nevertheless, in addition to advancing the state-of- the-art in the area of RF-based gait disorder assessment, this paper further contributes to the area of vision-based gait assessment, as discussed next.   In general,   there are more papers on vision-based gait disorder assessment, as compared to RF-based approaches. However, a direct comparison between WiFi-based and vision- based systems, under identical conditions and with the same subjects, is currently lacking. Such a side-by-side methodical comparison is important for providing guidelines on how such systems can be incorporated into the future smart health ecosystem. This paper thus contributes to the area of vision by providing such a comparison. Furthermore, this paper contrasts the performance of a vision-based system (as well as its WiFi- based counterpart) with that of neurologists when they provide a diagnosis solely based on the visual evaluation of the gait. 3) RF-based Methods: Radio frequency-based gait disorder analysis has recently gained attraction in the literature. How- ever, there are very limited number of work (six to the best of our knowledge) on gait-disorder assessment using RF signals, as briefly summarized next. In [12], [13], IR-UWB and K-band radars are utilized to classify healthy vs. abnormal gait, while [14] utilizes a customized frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar to detect Parkinson’s disease using nocturnal breathing signals. When considering WiFi sig- nals, WiFreeze [11] aims to detect freeze of gait in Parkinson’s patients, while [32] and [10] classify unhealthy vs. healthy gaits. Less related to this work is Liu et al. [33], which does not detect gait disorders, but analyzes the progress of Parkinson’s disease using customized FMCW radio equipment. We next compare our work with existing RF-based ones, as also summarized in Table I.   Scope of evaluation: Half of the existing RF-based work have not been tested with real patients, rather, the conditions have been enacted [10], [13], [32].   For those work that have tested with real patients [11], [12], [14], most collect a very small number of patients: 24 (only 4 unhealthy) in [12] and 15 in [11]. [14] has collected data of 53 subjects, albeit with customized radar equipment, and for detection based on breathing signals. In contrast, our paper reports on a comprehensive one-year-long clinical trial involving WiFi-based sensing of 114 subjects, thereby offering a significantly broader scope of investigation.   Spectrum of Considered Gait Disorders: Most existing RF-based gait assessment work have only considered one type of gait disorder (e.g., healthy vs. Parkinson). In this paper, we have undertaken a comprehensive clinical campaign encom- passing 5 common gait disorders: Parkinson’s, arthritis, neu- ropathy, post-stroke, and dementia, plus healthy. In addition, we also test with the following conditions: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury, Neurofibromatosis, and Dysferlinopathy, but at a smaller scale. Training Data Collection Burden: All the existing work (except for [14] which uses breathing signals and customized FMCW radar) have manually collected RF training data, which can be cumbersome and can result in non-generalizable results. This work, however, mainly uses available online videos to generate synthetic RF data for training, thus significantly re- ducing the training data collection burden and further ensuring generalizable results.   Testing in the Wild: Most existing work (all WiFi-based ones) that collected data of real subjects train and test in the same environment (using the same overall pool), potentially yielding non-generalizable results. In this paper, on the other hand, we adopt a novel approach by training with synthetic RF data derived from online videos, while testing in The Neurology Center during its normal operating hours. This ensures the robustness and generalizability of the findings of the paper.   Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of RF-based gait disorder assessment by running a one-year-long clinical trial encompassing a large spectrum of disorders (5 common gait disorders plus healthy). It then details the results of the data analysis of 114 subjects, while predominantly employing synthetic RF training data generated from available online videos, and relying only on off-the-shelf WiFi devices   (a pair of laptops) for sensing. Equally important, the paper provides a detailed comparison with our developed vision- based system, using identical subjects and conditions for both training and testing. It then contrasts the performance of these systems with the diagnostic accuracy of neurologists when they base their evaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait. Overall, the findings of the paper can provide guidelines for smart health system development and shape the integration of these new sensing modalities into medical practice, thus paving the way towards equitable healthcare.   III. A PRIMER ON RF SIGNAL MODELING Consider a person walking in an area, in the vicinity of a pair of WiFi transceivers, as shown in Fig. 1. The transmitter sends a signal, which bounces off of different parts of the body of the person, as well as other objects in the envi- ronment, and is received by the receiver. Then, the complex baseband received signal can be written as: 𝑠rec(𝑡) = 𝛼s𝑒 𝑗 𝜃𝑠 + 𝛼𝑖𝑒 𝑗 ( 2 𝜋 𝜆 𝑑𝑖) , where 𝜆 is 𝑙 ∈𝑉𝑠′ 𝛼𝑠′,𝑙𝑒 𝑗 𝜃𝑠′ ,𝑙 + 𝑖 ∈𝑉𝑏 the wavelength [34]. Moreover, 𝛼𝑖 is the magnitude of the scattered signal from the 𝑖th body part whose velocity is 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡), and 𝜓 = cos 𝜙𝑅 + cos 𝜙𝑇 , where 𝜙𝑅 and 𝜙𝑇 are the angles between the direction of motion and the vectors from the transmitter and receiver to the body, respectively. 𝑑𝑖 is the initial length of the 𝑖th path, and 𝑉𝑏 is the set of body points visible to both the receiver and the transmitter. The first and second terms then embrace the impact of the direct path and the reflections from static objects, respectively. We note that at WiFi frequencies, and for the area dimensions considered in this paper, we have a far-field scenario. As such, we took 𝜓 to be the same for all the body parts, as done in the literature. The WiFi receiver, however, can only measure the received signal magnitude or phase difference. We then next summarize an approximated modeling of the received RF signal magnitude [34], [35]. More specifically, since the LOS path is much stronger than the other reflections, i.e., |𝛼𝑠 | ≫ |𝛼𝑖 | and |𝛼𝑠 | ≫ |𝛼𝑠′,𝑙 |, for ∀𝑖, 𝑙, we have the following for the received signal magnitude: ∫ ∑︁   |𝑠rec(𝑡)| ≈ 𝛾 +   The first term, 𝛾 = 𝛼𝑠 + 𝑙 ∈𝑉𝑠′ 𝛼𝑠′,𝑙 cos(𝜃𝑠′,𝑙 − 𝜃𝑠), is static and removed after DC removal, and the second term embraces the information of the moving body parts. A similar expression can be derived for the phase difference signal.   IV. SYNTHETIC RF DATA GENERATION A proper training of a classifier requires extensive training data. For WiFi sensing applications, however, WiFi sensing   datasets pertaining to specific tasks of interest (e.g., gait disorder classification in this paper) are not readily available. Furthermore, manual collection of such datasets can be pro- hibitive. In the area of vision, on the other hand, there is an abundance of vision dataset pertaining to many different scenarios. Thus, in recent years, there has been an interest in translating such vision datasets to synthetic RF training datasets (albeit for other applications) [35]–[37].   In this paper, we then utilize a publicly-available gait disorder vision dataset of real subjects for generating synthetic RF training data. In this section, we set forth the details of our pipeline for translating a vision input to a synthetic RF signal. As we shall see, the typical human mesh recovery approaches in vision result in a 3D mesh that has a higher sampling rate for certain body parts. This can then magnify the impact of those body parts when generating synthetic RF signals. As such, in this part, we also propose a new approach for remedying this issue. We next discuss the stpng in detail.   Consider a video of a person walking with a gait disor- der. We first utilize a state-of-the-art human mesh recovery algorithm (HMR) to extract a 3D point cloud of the body for each frame [38]. However, the output 3D mesh generated by HMR is a non-uniform point cloud whose spatial density is a function of the curvature of the body. In other words, the higher the curvature of a body part, the more mesh points are allocated to it. Fig. 3 (a) shows an example of this where we have utilized the state-of-the-art in HMR to translate a snapshot of a walk into its 3D point cloud. We can see the zoomed-in mesh points for two body parts: the hands and the legs, where hands are sampled much more heavily due to the high surface curvature. This can then result in the body parts with higher curvatures contributing more than they truly would to the received signal. We next show how to address this issue using 𝛼-shapes.   B. Finding 𝛼-Shapes of Human Mesh   HMR provides the 3D mesh as a set of discrete point cloud. We then translate the points to non-overlapping sub-surfaces that cover the whole body using 𝛼-shapes. The 𝛼-shape of a set of points is a polytope (not necessarily convex) that best fits the corresponding set [39]. It can thus be considered as a generalization of convex hulls. By forming the 𝛼-shape of our given mesh points, we then effectively smooth out the impact of non-uniform sampling and further generate a set of non-overlapping triangular sub-surfaces, for wave simulation purposes. More specifically, we use the output body partitions provided by HMR (e.g., torso, shoulder, etc.) and create the 𝛼- shape of each body part, using Delaunay triangulation. Fig. 3 (b) shows the generated 𝛼-shapes for Fig. 3 (a). As seen, we now have a set of sub-surfaces whose area is proportional to the area of the corresponding body part, thus resolving the original high sampling rate issue.   We finally simulate the interaction of the incoming wave with the 3D human shape consisting of the 𝛼-shape-based sub- surfaces of Sec. IV-B, with the transceivers as discussed in Sec. IV-C, and by using the visibility assessment and scattering model of Sec.IV-D and IV-E, respectively. More specifically, by using Born approximation, we have [34], [35], ∑︁   𝑠𝑟 = 𝑔(𝑃𝑇 𝑋, 𝑃𝑅𝑋) +   Since HMR provides its output in pixels, the 𝛼-shapes will also be in pixels. By using the provided camera location and walk distance from the video, we then translate the pixels into meters. Finally, we place the resulting 3D human shape, consisting of triangular sub-surfaces, in the vicinity of a pair of transceivers in a simulation environment, according to the desired setup, to simulate the walking away motion [35].   Let 𝑐𝑖 and 𝑛𝑖 denote the center and normal vector of the 𝑖th sub-surface. We apply a visibility detection algorithm [40] to the centers to find sub-surfaces visible to both the transmitter and receiver. With a finite sampling rate, this algorithm may misclassify a small set of points [40]. To address this, we perform an additional step. Let ˆ𝑥 (𝑖) 𝑅𝑋 denote the unit vector from the transmitter to 𝑐𝑖, and from 𝑐𝑖 to the receiver, respectively. If ⟨ ˆ𝑥 (𝑖) 𝑅𝑋, 𝑛𝑖⟩ is positive, then the 𝑖th point will not be visible to the transceivers, where ⟨, ⟩ denotes the inner product. We then remove all such points if still in the output, thus further reducing the chance of false positives. We denote the final visible set by 𝑉𝑏.   E. Modeling the Scattering Pattern   Consider the specular (mirror-like) vector of the 𝑖th sub- surface: ˆ𝑥 (𝑖) 𝑖𝑛𝑐 − 2⟨ ˆ𝑥𝑖𝑛𝑐, 𝑛𝑖⟩𝑛𝑖. We model the quasi- specular scattering pattern of the body using a Lambertian 𝑖𝑛𝑐)(𝛼𝑒 𝑗 𝜙 + 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑚(𝜃𝑖)), model [41], [42]: 𝑅(𝑐𝑖) = where 𝛼 and 𝛽 are the relative strength of these terms, 𝑚 determines the directivity of the quasi-specular component, and 𝜙 is randomly chosen from [0, 2𝜋]. Moreover, 𝐴𝑖 is the area of the 𝑖th sub-surface and 𝜃𝑖 is the angle between ˆ𝑥 (𝑖) 𝑅𝑋 and 𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑐. In this manner, 𝐴𝑖 cos(𝜃 (𝑖) ˆ𝑥 (𝑖) 𝑖𝑛𝑐) takes the effective area of the 𝑖th surface into account.   where 𝑔( 𝑝1, 𝑝2) = is the free space Green’s function, 𝑅(𝑐𝑖) is the scattering coefficient of the 𝑖th sub-surface, and 𝑉𝑏 is the set of visible points. Eq. 2 then allows us to translate a video input to synthetic RF data, which we shall use for training purposes in this paper.   In this section, we present the details of our one-year- long clinical trial for testing the proposed pipeline. This is then followed by Sec. VI, where we extensively show the performance of the proposed pipeline when assessing the gait in The Neurology Center.   We have partnered with board-certified neurologists from The Neurology Center, in order to extensively test our pro- posed pipeline with real patients exhibiting a variety of gait disorders, and in a real office space. Through this partnership, the clinic dedicated a 7m × 3.18m covered space to our experiments, as shown in Fig. 4. We have then placed a pair of laptops in this area, where one acts as a WiFi transmitter and the other as a WiFi receiver.   As discussed in Sec. I, the system is envisioned to be used in smart health settings (e.g., smart home setting). As such, patients should be asked to walk the most meaningful route for the assessment, which is the one perpendicular to the line connecting the transmitter and receiver. Then, the patients are asked to walk back and forth two times, starting from the marked start point to the marked end point. We note that we do not have any control over how the patients walk, and as such, they can deviate from a straight path at times. We finally note that the route is not marked on the ground from the start to the endpoint, as enforcing walking on a marked route can affect how the patients walk, and can thus obscure the gait disorder. We then place the transmitter and receiver 64cm apart (std=16cm), and at the height of 1.1m (std=5cm). The distance from the start point to the link connecting the transmitter and   receiver is 95cm (std=15cm). Then, the patients are asked to walk back and forth two times, from the start point to the end point, where each one-way is 3.9m (std=0.1m). We note that the observed slight variability in these parameters is due to the restrictions from The Neurology Center on leaving behind floor markers/equipment.   Remark 2: In this paper, a gait sample refers to a one-way   walk from start to end in Fig. 4, or vice versa.   B. Duration of the Clinical Trial   We have run extensive experimental validations with real subjects in the aforementioned Neurology Center over the course of one year. Since some patients may revisit the clinic, we have ensured that each patient is only included once in our experiments.   In the first phase of this clinical trial, we have tested our proposed pipeline with the WiFi data of 101 subjects, spanning over 6 gait conditions: Parkinson’s disease (20), dementia (14), post-stroke (16), arthritis (hip or knee, 8), neuropathy (10), and healthy (33). We note that the uneven distribution of the numbers across conditions partly mirrors the visit frequency of each class to the clinic.   We further note that the participants may experience differ- ent degrees of disease severity, which can affect the sensing performance. We extensively discuss such impacts in the next section. Finally, we note that we have also collected additional data from subjects suffering from other conditions, or multiple simultaneous conditions, as detailed in the next section.   It is important to collect the data of healthy subjects in the same environment for consistency. As such, the healthy individuals are recruited from the following groups: patients who visited the clinic for other neurological issues that do not have a gait manifestation (mainly from migraine patients), the companions of the patients, and the staff of The Neurology Center, among others.   As mentioned earlier, most patients walked back and forth two times. We then only use those parts where the participant walks away from the link as it is indicated to have a better signal quality [34]. This then amounts to two gait samples for most patients, each of which then independently contributes to the overall test pool. Overall, 101 subjects amounted to a total of 204 gait samples.   D. Human-Subject Protocol and Recruitment Process   the compensation, and other details to ensure compliance with the guidelines of our Institutional Review Board (IRB). Once a patient agrees to take part in our medical trials, he/she then walks back and forth a couple of times in the area of Fig. 4, as detailed in Section V-A. The collected data are then stored in an anonymized manner (using an identification code), and the ground-truth gait diagnosis is provided to us by the doctor. We note that our Institutional Review Board (IRB)   committee has reviewed and approved this research.   E. Establishing the Ground-truth   Having a ground-truth for establishing the accuracy of our proposed system is crucial. Neurologists utilize many inputs to establish a diagnosis, in addition to a visual inspection. These can include: the results from vision and speech assessment, sensory perception and mental status evaluations, brain scans, genetic and blood tests, cerebro-spinal fluid analysis, and elec- troencephalography [43]. Our medical partners then furnish us with their definitive diagnosis for each patient, which we then adopt as the ground-truth. In addition, the doctor provide us with their assessment of the severity of each condition, categorizing it as mild, moderate, or severe.   F. WiFi Data Collection and Processing   We use a pair of laptops equipped with an Intel 5300 WLAN card as transceivers to collect the WiFi data (See Fig. 4). While the patient is walking, the transmitter sends 500 packets/second in channel 64 with a center frequency of 5.32 GHz. For each of the three receiving antennas, the channel state information (CSI) of 30 sub-carriers and the subsequent signal magnitude is obtained using CSI Tool [44], resulting in 90 data streams. We then denoise the data by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For each PCA component, a spectrogram is generated using a combination of multi-window Hermite functions and STFT, based on a window of size 0.3 seconds and a time shift of 16 ms [34]. The final spectrogram is then generated by averaging over the first 15 spectrograms.   G. Generating Synthetic RF Training Data from Public Videos   In this paper, we utilize available online videos to gen- erate synthetic RF training data, as proposed in Sec. IV. More specifically, using available online videos [45], we have formed a video dataset of 78 subjects for synthetic WiFi training data generation, encompassing the following three gait conditions: Parkinson’s, arthritis, and healthy. This dataset has side-view perspective of the subjects, which is most informative for HMR [38]. We note that there are no publicly-available dataset for the other three gait disorders of interest to this paper. However, this has little impact on our performance as we shall see in the next section. Each subject then contributes to two gait samples (except for one person), amounting to a total video dataset of 155 gait samples: Parkinson’s (26), arthritis (70), and healthy (59).   During their visit to the center, the patients are handed out a pamphlet that details the purpose of the study, the procedure,   We then apply the proposed pipeline of Fig. 2 to each video. More specifically, the Human Mesh Recovery (HMR)   algorithm of [38] is first applied to the video to extract a 3D point cloud of the person, which is then up-sampled to 250 fps. We then apply the 𝛼-shape algorithm [39] to each body part individually, to generate the sub-surfaces. For each body part, we set a fixed 𝛼-radius, which we empirically optimize by utilizing a small number of videos. In general, the smaller the body part, the smaller the 𝛼-shape radius should be.   After generating the sub-surfaces, we set   the WiFi transceivers in a simulation environment, according to the configuration of Fig. 4, in order to simulate the synthetic RF data that would have been generated if the person in the video was in a WiFi area. We then apply the wave simulator of Sec. IV, using the reflection model of Sec. IV-E and visibility assessment of Sec. IV-D. To empirically optimize and set the parameters for 𝑚, 𝛼, and 𝛽 of this simulator, we simultaneously collect the WiFi and video data of 2 participants, one with normal and one with an abnormal gait, which are then only used for this purpose (not in training or testing). Overall, the end-to-end pipeline results in 155 synthetic RF gait samples of 78 subjects.   H. Spectrogram Generation and Feature Extraction   For each RF training data sample, we generate its spectro- gram using a combination of multi-window Hermite functions and STFT [34]. We note that we only consider the central 50% time span of each walk, in order to remove the acceleration and deceleration parts as well as any other unrelated movements at the onset or conclusion of the activity. We then extract six features from each spectrogram for training a machine learning pipeline, as discussed next.   In order to find the torso speed, we first sum the spectrogram over frequency for each time instant. We next obtain the shortest frequency window where the sum of the spectrogram values is greater than 50% of the overall sum (for each time step). This leads to two distinct curves that mark the lower and upper boundaries of the resultant frequency band. We then remove the outliers using the generalized extreme studentized deviate (GESD) test, and smooth the curves by running a moving average over 4 samples. Finally, we apply the same 50% method to the obtained spectrogram band and average the upper and lower bound curves to get the torso speed. We then find the following six features accordingly: Average torso speed: This is the average of the torso speed over time; Minimum and maximum of torso speed: We calculate the minimum and maximum speed of the torso from its speed curve; Gait Cycle: This is obtained by finding the peak values (at least 0.3 seconds apart) in the autocorrelation function of the torso speed [34], [46]; Step Length: We calculate the average step length, which is the stride time (half of gait cycle) times the average torso speed [34]; Torso speed variations: We obtain the average difference between the maximum torso speed (90% percentile) and minimum torso speed (10% percentile) across all stpng [34].   I. Training a Gait Disorder Classifier for WiFi-based Sensing We train a feed-forward, fully connected multi-layer percep- tron (MLP) neural network with two hidden layers for WiFi- based gait disorder detection, given the features of Sec. V-H,   and by using the generated synthetic video-to-RF data of 78 subjects. The hidden layers have 512 and 256 nodes, respec- tively. The dropout layers are applied to both hidden layers with the parameter 0.5. We utilize ReLU as the activation function for the hidden layers and softmax function at the output layer. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00001 and a weighted cross-entropy loss function is then used to train the network for 100 epochs, with a batch size of 10.   The synthetic RF training data is generated from videos. Thus, it not only is a completely different modality, but it also naturally encompasses different subjects and environments as compared to those used in testing. These two factors result in the well-known domain and distribution shift problem between the training and test samples in machine learning [47]. To address this, we use WiFi data of 12 subjects (6 healthy, 3 Parkinson’s, and 3 arthritis) to re-weigh the loss function via an exhaustive search that aims to maximize the overall system’s average accuracy for this small dataset. We then repeat the search process ten times and declare the median of the weight as the final value. To ensure robustness, the gait assessment’s overall performance during testing is then averaged over 8 random sampling of the 12 domain-adaptation subjects, out of the collected WiFi data of 101 subjects, while the rest 89 subjects are left for testing in each round.   We next extensively discuss the performance of the pro-   posed pipeline with real patients.   In this section, we present and analyze the outcomes of our one-year-long clinical trial in The Neurology Center, involving 114 subjects. Our analysis is comprehensive as it covers various different gait conditions. We further show the impact of the severity of the disease on the classification accuracy, in addition to demonstrating the impact of age, height, and weight on WiFi-based sensing of gait disorder. Moreover, we show the performance of our system with other gait conditions such as ALS, spinal cord injury, dysferlinopathy, and multiple sclerosis, and demonstrate how they are mainly classified as unhealthy. We finally show the results when testing with patients that suffer from multiple gait conditions.   Overall, the results shed light on the feasibility of these signals for detecting gait disorders and can provide guidance on how they can be incorporated into future health systems.   In this part, we discuss the performance of our classifier when tested with 101 subjects. More specifically, the overall average per subject accuracy of this classifier is 85.61%, with an average per class accuracy of 85.47%, with the following breakdown over the two classes: unhealthy (85.8%) and healthy (85.13%). Fig. 5 further shows the average classifi- cation accuracy per condition. As can be seen, the performance is mostly consistent per condition. The lower performance for some conditions (e.g., Parkinson’s) can be largely attributed to   patients, while having a higher incidence of unhealthy cases than the younger group.   We next show the performance of the WiFi-based sensing system when evaluating subjects with other conditions. To- wards this goal, we additionally collect WiFi test data for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (1 subject), multiple sclerosis (MS) (3 subjects), spinal cord injury (2 subjects), neurofibromatosis (1 subject), and dysferlinopathy (1 subject) amounting to a total of 8 subjects and 20 gait sam- ples. It is worth emphasizing that these conditions are not seen during training or domain adaptation. We then feed these to our aforementioned classifier. The system was able to classify all these cases as unhealthy except for two patients, one with ALS (always misclassified) and the other with Neurofibromatosis (one of his/her sample walks was accurately classified in 2 out of the eight random samplings of domain adaptation-test selections while the other was always misclassified).   Overall, this shows the potential of the system to extend to unseen conditions. To improve the accuracy, sample data of these cases can also be included during training and/or domain adaptation.   E. Cases with Multiple Conditions   Some patients may suffer from multiple gait-related condi- tions. It is thus important to evaluate the performance of our classifier for such cases. Towards this goal, we have further recruited 5 patients who suffer from multiple conditions: arthritis and neuropathy (1 patient), dementia and post-stroke (1 patient), Parkinson’s and neuropathy (1 patient), Parkinson’s and Dementia (1 patient), arthritis, neuropathy and spinal cord injury (1 patient) amounting to a total of 10 gait samples.   All these patients were classified as unhealthy by our clas- sifier except for the person with Parkinson’s and neuropathy (one sample walk is accurately classified in half of the domain adaption-test selections while the other is accurately classified only in 1 out of 8 selections). Overall, this shows the robust performance of the system even in classifying cases with multiple conditions.   In this paper, our goal   is to provide a comprehensive investigation of gait disorder sensing with different modalities. Towards this goal, we next delve into developing a video- based gait disorder classifier. While there are a number of video-based gait disorder classifiers, as surveyed in Sec. II, the   the disparate distribution of disease severity across conditions, or to how differently these conditions manifest in gait.   B. Impact of Disease Severity   The severity of a gait disorder can play a key role in its identification, with the expectation that more severe cases have a more clear gait manifestation, making it easier to classify them. We next show the impact of disease severity on the classification accuracy. To establish ground truth, The Neurology Center has categorized each case as mild, moderate, or severe. Table II subsequently presents the breakdown of the probability of correct classification (as unhealthy) based on disease severity, for the unhealthy gait conditions. As can be seen, the accuracy increases as the severity of the disease increases, as expected.   C. Impact of Age, Weight, and Height   This section provides a demographic breakdown of the performance of the proposed classifier, across different age groups, genders, body weights, and heights. As seen in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), the system shows a consistent performance over different ranges of heights and weights. Similarly, the classifier attained an accuracy of 86.61% for individuals self- identifying as males and 84.83% for those self-identifying as females, demonstrating its capability to accurately classify participants across gender lines. On the other hand, Fig. 6 (c) illustrates enhanced performance in classifying older or younger participants, with a notable decline in the accuracy for middle-aged individuals. We can attribute the observed pattern to the fact that the older subjects typically exhibit more severe symptoms, while the younger group predominantly constitute healthy cases. Meanwhile, the middle-aged cohort generally exhibit symptoms that are less severe than those of older   results of this section are important for the following reason. In order to effectively compare the performance of WiFi and video-based methods, it is crucial to test them under the same exact conditions (same subjects, environment, etc). In other words, they should be compared based on concurrent video and WiFi recordings of the same subjects. This is important since variability of the subjects can impact the severity of the underlying condition, and variability of the location/time can also result in different sensing qualities, preventing derivations of meaningful conclusions. We next lay out the details of our vision-based system and compare it with the previous WiFi- based pipeline.   Training Dataset: We use the same exact publicly-available online video dataset, used for generating synthetic RF data in Sec. V-G, for training the vision-based system.   Test Subjects: For the purpose of testing, we need to concurrently collect videos of the same subjects that are used for testing the WiFi pipeline. The patient recruitment process is as described in Sec. V-D, where the patients have the option of participating in only WiFi data collection, or both video and WiFi. For those who agree to both, we then collect their video and WiFi simultaneously, with the video being recorded from the side since it is the most informative for mesh recovery (all online videos are side-views as well). The videos are then recorded using an ultra-wide lens setting, with an aperture of f/2.4 and a 120-degree field of view, at a frame rate of 30 frames per second. We note that the scattered WiFi signals from the tripod and camera are filtered during the DC removal phase, thus not affecting the WiFi pipeline. Finally, we note that our Institutional Review Board (IRB) committee has also reviewed and approved the video collection process. Feature Extraction and Training: The parameters we have used as features in the vision-based system are the same as those utilized in our WiFi pipeline. More specifically, we use the middle 50% of each walk to exclude the acceleration and deceleration parts. We then generate the 3D point cloud of the body for each frame, which we then partition into 14 parts (hands, legs, torso, etc.). The average position of the points associated with each part results in 14 key points. We obtain the average, minimum (10% percentile), and maximum (90% percentile) of the torso speed as our first three features. To extract the gait cycle, we analyze the vertical position curves of each foot separately and over time. We then filter out the   frequencies higher than 4 Hz to remove noise (the cadence for a fast run is around 180 strides/minute, which gives a gait cycle frequency of 1.5 Hz). Subsequently, we determine the gait cycle by computing the time difference between the extrema (at least 0.25 seconds apart) on each curve. Finally, we use the average of two gait cycles as the overall gait cycle, which serves as our fourth feature. It is worth mentioning that if, due to the noise of HMR and lack of visibility of one foot, the algorithm cannot extract the gait cycle from one foot, we only consider the gait cycle of the other foot. Finally, the step length and torso speed variations are obtained similar to our WiFi pipeline.   Using these 6 features, we then train a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers, while keeping all the specifications identical to the WiFi system (see Sec. V-I). For training, we have the same exact subjects and associated walk samples as in the video-to-RF training dataset of Sec. V-G. We note that while we had 101 subjects for WiFi testing in Sec. VI-A, we only have consents from 72 of those subjects for video recording. As such, later in this section, we will also further report the performance of the WiFi system with only those subjects as well, for a fair comparison.   More specifically, we have the following breakdown over the 72 subjects: Parkinson’s disease (12), dementia (8), post- stroke (11), arthritis (hip or knee, 4), neuropathy (6), and healthy (31), totaling 293 test gait samples (average of 49 gait samples per condition). We note that we use both back and forth of the walks here as they both present informative side-views for a vision-based system. We then use the same number of patients/conditions for domain adaptation (12 total), as described for the WiFi pipeline. The overall performance is then averaged over 8 random sampling of the 60 subjects out of the overall pool of 72 subjects.   Performance Analysis: Fig. 7 summarizes the breakdown of the performance over different conditions, for our video- based classifier. Moreover, the overall average per subject accuracy of this classifier is 83.80%, with an average per class accuracy of 84.37%, with the following breakdown over the two classes: unhealthy (81.09%) and healthy (87.64%). As explained for the WiFi case, the variability of the performance among the conditions can be mainly attributed to the disparate distribution of disease severity across different conditions, or to different gait manifestation of the conditions. Overall, a   condition based only on the visual inspection of the walk, for proper comparison. It is worth noting that this is the first of such a study, to the best of our knowledge.   Towards this goal, we have designed a survey in Qualtrics [48]. Our survey is comprehensive, going beyond binary classification of the gait, which we shall discuss extensively in the next section. In this section, we discuss a part of the survey that facilitates comparison with our developed WiFi and video- based systems. Consider 72 questions (12 per each condition on average). Each question shows a video of a patient’s gait and requests a diagnosis by selecting their top three preferred options from a list of six conditions of interest to this paper (the same choice can be made for the top three as well). The videos are from the same subjects used for testing our video- based system for an apples-to-apples comparison. We have further partnered with Survey Healthcare Global (SHG), an entity that provides “measurable healthcare expert opinions,” via recruitment and other tools [15], who then disseminated our survey to their pool of certified neurologists. In total, we have received an average of 197 responses per condition from 70 neurologists, for each of the 6 conditions of interest to this paper (5 gait disorders + healthy). To evaluate the performance of neurologists in diagnosing gait-related condi- tions, we calculate a binary classification accuracy (healthy vs. unhealthy) similar to the proposed WiFi or video systems. For this purpose, an answer is accurate if a neurologist identifies a healthy (unhealthy) subject as healthy (unhealthy) in their first choice.   Table III shows the results for each class (healthy and unhealthy) and the average per-class accuracy. It is interest- ing to observe that both WiFi and video-based systems exhibit slightly superior performance compared to that of neurologists, when they only use visual inspection. This is important as it has implications for how WiFi or video-based systems can be incorporated into a smart health system. As discussed in Sec. II, neurologists utilize many inputs when establishing a medical diagnosis. Nevertheless, some of these inputs can be easily collected and integrated with a WiFi or video-based sensing system. Such a system can then provide healthcare for a larger population, and can collaborate with neurologists as needed.   We next discuss potential future directions.   Thus far, we have developed a WiFi-based gait disorder assessment system that can classify the gait into healthy and unhealthy. The natural next step would be to see if such signals   video-based system can also be a key player in an automated gait disorder assessment system. However, it can raise privacy concerns or may not be favorable for some patients, motivating the use of RF signals.   WiFi-based vs. Video-based: Fig. 5 and 7 show the results of WiFi and video-based, respectively. However, as mentioned earlier, we did not have consents of all the 101 subjects for video recording. As such, while the two systems are trained on the same exact online video subjects, our video pipeline thus far is tested on 72 subjects while the WiFi is tested on a bigger set of 101 subjects. For a fair comparison, here we report the performance of the WiFi system when only tested on the same exact 72 subjects, while ensuring the same random sampling and domain-adaptation process. This results in an average per class accuracy of 84.41%, unhealthy (83.03%) and healthy (85.78%), with an overall average per subject accuracy of 84.19%. We can see that this does not impact the performance of the WiFi system, as compared to the results of Sec. VI-A, since the number of subjects is high. When comparing this WiFi’s performance with that of the video, we can see that they are comparable. This is promising as it indicates the potential of WiFi for capturing gait disorders. It also creates the potential for multi-modality sensing, as we discuss in Sec. IX-C. To the best of our knowledge this is the first result that compares the performance of WiFi and video when capturing gait disorders, using the same exact subjects/conditions. Such an apples-to-apples comparison is important for establishing meaningful conclusions.   As mentioned in Sec. II, neurologists rely on many inputs, in addition to a visual inspection of the gait, to establish a diag- nosis. In this paper, we have thus far shown the performance of gait disorder classification based on the information gait induces in the WiFi signal (or in a video). It is thus fitting to find the performance of neurologists when diagnosing a   While considerably challenging, considering very mild cases can also be another interesting research avenue.   are capable of not only identifying an unhealthy gait but also categorizing it to the specific underlying disorder. While there are several work on WiFi signals classifying different activities, such activities typical have a sizable footprint on the received signal. Exploring the efficacy of these signals in classifying gait disorders thus remains a subject of future exploration. It is worth noting that there are work in the area of vision on classifying the underlying disorder. It would be interesting to see how an RF-based system compares, and further expand the scope of the vision-based systems.   B. Experts’ Accuracy Based on Visual Inspection – Classifi- cation   As outlined earlier, we conducted an extensive survey to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of neurologists when rely- ing solely on visual gait inspection. In Sec. VIII, we then detailed its findings regarding the classification of gait as either unhealthy or healthy. Here, we discuss the results when neurologists classify gait into one of the six conditions of to this paper. This is important as it provides a interest benchmark for future RF-based work that aims to further classify the gait disorder to its underlying condition. Table IV summarizes the results, with an overall average accuracy of 30.89% per condition. These initial results indicate the importance of the other inputs (discussed in Sec. V-E) that are part of the diagnostic process, which have the potential to be more easily collected, and integrated with an RF-based or a video-based sensing system. Finally, it is noteworthy that despite using the identical dataset as in Fig. 7, the conditions challenging for assessment differ when assessed by humans.   In this paper, we only used one sample walk instance of the subject. Using more walk samples or a longer walk duration can further improve the performance. Moreover, we have used only 6 features for training the network, for both our WiFi and video-based systems. Additionally, the same 6 features are used for both systems for consistency. As part of future work, more features can be utilized and further tailored to each sensing modality. Also, a multi-modal WiFi and video- based system can be developed to increase the robustness. In addition, using more samples of different gait disorders for training can also improve the quality. For instance, we have only used samples of two gait disorders (plus healthy) during training/domain adaptation. Finally, in terms of disease severity, we only considered mild, moderate and severe cases.   An important future direction would be to integrate addi- tional medical inputs (e.g., patient intake information, blood tests, brain scans) with the collected RF (or video) sensing data. Given that some of these inputs can be collected more easily (do not require expertise of neurologists), a successful integration can hold promise for an automated smart health system, paving the way towards equitable healthcare.   In this paper, we reported on the findings of a one-year-long clinical trial for gait disorder assessment. More specifically, we developed the first WiFi-based gait disorder sensing system of its kind, distinguished by its scope of validation with a large and diverse patient cohort. To ensure generalizability, our sys- tem was mainly trained on synthetic RF data, converted from publicly-available videos of gait disorders, via developing a video-to-RF pipeline. We further developed a vision-based gait disorder assessment system under the same exact conditions, and provided the first apples-to-apples comparison between the WiFi-based and video-based ones. We finally contrasted both systems with the accuracy of neurologists when basing evaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait. Overall, the results can play a key role for the proper integration of these sensing modalities into medical practice.",

Both the\ntwo proposed adaptation methods are data-efficient, requiring\nminimal data collecting and labeling.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nCompared to recognition-based robotic grasping (i.e., em-\nploying pre-trained recognition modules), the challenges of\nattribute-based grasping are 1) mapping from workspace im-\nages and query text of the target to robot motions, 2) asso-\nciating abstract attributes with raw pixels, 3) data labeling\nin target-driven grasping, and 4) data-efficient adaptation to\nunknown objects and new scenes. In this paper, we design\nan architecture that consists of a multimodal encoder (i.e.,\nencoding both visual and textual data) and an affordances\ndecoder (i.e., predicting instance grasping affordances [6]).\nThe key aspects of our system are:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• We design the deep grasping neural networks that rep-\nresent 3-DOF grasp poses. After encoding and fusing\nvisual-textual representations,\nthe networks rotate the\nfused features to account for different grasping angles,\nand then predict pixel-wise instance grasping affordances.\n• To learn a multimodal metric space, we employ the\nequation of object persistence before and after grasping;\nthe visual embedding of a grasped object should be equal\nto the textual embedding of that object.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• Our model learns object attributes that generalize to new\nobjects and scenes by only using basic objects (of various\ncolors and shapes) in simulation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• With the pre-trained attribute representations, our model\nsupports efficient adaptation with minimal data. Ad-\nversarial adaptation regulates the image encoder with\naugmented data of unlabeled images, whereas one-grasp\nadaptation updates the end-to-end model with augmented\ndata requiring only one successful grasp trial. Both\nadaption approaches are data-efficient, and they can be\nemployed independently or in combination to improve\ninstance grasping performance.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe deep grasping model\nin our approach is fully self-\nsupervised through the interactions between the robot and\nobjects. Fig. 1 presents an example of attribute-based robotic\ngrasping, wherein our approach successfully grounds object\nattributes and accurately predicts grasping affordances for an\nattributes-specified target object.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn our prior work [1], we proposed 1) an end-to-end\narchitecture for learning text-commanded robotic manipulation\nand 2) a method of self-supervising multimodal attribute em-\nbeddings through object grasping to facilitate quick adaptation.\nAs an evolved paper, this article presents an in-depth study\nof adaptation in robotic manipulation and strives to improve\nthe autonomy of robots by achieving self-supervision and\nself-adaptation. The pre-trained model is self-supervised in\na simulation that only uses basic objects of various colors\nand shapes. In our adaptation framework, we make use of\nautonomous robots to collect raw data for adaptation. We\npresent three core technical contributions as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n1) A sequential adaptation scheme. We propose a robotic\ngrasping adaptation framework that comprises two stack-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nable and data-efficient adaptation methods. The adversar-\nial adaptation and one-grasp adaptation methods aim to\ncomprehensively adapt the model for object recognition\nand grasping. Through data-efficient adaptation, the robot\nadeptly grasps challenging objects, eliminating the need\nfor extensive data collection.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2) Data-efficient augmentation methods. We design data\naugmentation methods that only require unlabeled images\nof candidate objects for adversarial adaptation and one-\ngrasp data of a target object for one-grasp adaptation.\n3) Evaluation and analysis of robot grasping. We evaluate\nthe grasping model in simulated and real-world scenes\nwith various testing objects and domain gaps, which veri-\nfies the effectiveness of our grasping model. Furthermore,\nthe ablative analysis of the data augmentation methods\nshows the efficiency of our approach.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWith observations from an RGB-D camera, our robot system is\ndesigned to grasp a target object following the user command\ncontaining object attributes. To our best knowledge, this is\nthe first work that explores object attributes to improve the\ngeneralization and adaptation of deep robotic grasping models.\nWe believe that the adaptation framework not only enhances\nthe overall performance but also opens up new possibilities\nfor solving the problem in target-driven robotic manipulation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nII. RELATED WORK\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nA. Instance Grasping\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThough there are different taxonomies, the existing work\nof robotic grasping can be roughly divided according to\napproaches and tasks: 1) model-driven [7] and data-driven [8]\napproaches; 2) indiscriminate [9] [10] and instance grasping\n[2] tasks. Our approach is data-driven and focuses on instance\ngrasping. Typical instance grasping pipelines assume a pre-\ntrained object recognition module (e.g., detection [2], seg-\nmentation [3] [11], template matching [12], and object repre-\nsentation [13], etc.), limiting the generalization for unknown\nobjects and the scalability of grasping pipelines. Our model\nis end-to-end and exploits object attributes for generaliza-\ntion. Some recent research also proposes end-to-end learning\nmethods for instance robotic grasping. [14] learns to predict\nthe grasp configuration for an object class with a learning\nframework composed of object detection, classification, and\ngrasp planning. In [15], CCAN, an attention-based network,\nlearns to locate the target object and predict the corresponding\ngrasp affordances given a query image. Compared to these\nmethods, the main features of our work are two-fold. First,\nwe collect a much smaller dataset of synthetic basic objects to\nlearn generic attribute-based grasping. Moreover, our generic\ngrasping model is capable of further adapting to new objects\nand domains. Second, our approach takes a description text of\ntarget attributes as a query command, which is more flexible\nwhen grasping a novel object.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nB. Attribute-Based Methods\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nObject attributes are middle-level abstractions of object\nproperties and generalizable across object categories [16].\nLearning object attributes has been widely studied in the tasks\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nof object recognition [17], [18], [19], [20], while attribute-\nbased robotic grasping has been much less explored, except\nfor [21], [22]. Cohen et al. [21] developed a robotic system\nto pick up the target object corresponding to a description of\nattributes. Their approach minimizes the cosine similarity loss\nbetween visual and textual embeddings as well as predicts ob-\nject attributes. However, they only show generalization across\nviewpoints but not object categories. In [22], the proposed\nText2Pickup system uses object attributes to specify a target\nobject and removes ambiguities in the user’s command. They\nuse mono-color blocks as training and testing objects but fail\nto show generalization to novel objects. In contrast, our work\nlearns generic attribute-based robotic grasping (only using\nsynthetic basic objects) and generalizes well to novel objects\nand real-world scenes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nC. Model Generalization\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nModel generalization is one of the most important chal-\nlenges in robotic manipulation. To improve model generaliza-\ntion, various approaches to bridging domain gaps have been\nproposed. Domain randomization [23] is one frequently used\nmethod, which collects more diverse data by randomizing\nsimulation settings. Some recent research [24], [25], [26]\nhave applied domain randomization to improve the real-world\ngeneralization of a simulation-trained robot policy. We build\na simulation environment and apply domain randomization\nduring the pre-training of a generic model. In addition to\ndomain randomization, we propose two adaption methods fol-\nlowing the form of domain adaptation and few-shot learning.\nDomain adaptation [5], a subcategory of transfer learning\n[27], is used to reduce the domain shift between the source\nand target domain when the feature space is the same but\nthe distributions are different. Inspired by adversarial domain\nadaptation [28], our approach learns a domain classifier and\nthe image encoder learns domain-invariant features to con-\nfuse the classifier. We propose an object-level augmentation\nmethod to enrich the image dataset for adversarial training,\nincreasing the generalization of the encoder to new domains.\nWhile there exist similar work, for example, Chen et al. [29]\ninvestigated domain adversarial training in their work, their\napproach focuses on updating the feature adaptor and the\ndiscriminator using unlabeled data, rather than updating the\ngrasp synthesis model. In contrast, our grasping adaptation\napproach, consisting of unsupervised adversarial adaptation\nand supervised few-shot learning, jointly updates the grasping\npipeline.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFew-shot learning [30] is the paradigm of learning from a\nsmall number of examples at test time. The key of metric-\nbased few-shot learning method, one of the most popular\ncategories, is to supervise the latent space and learn a versatile\nsimilarity function by metric loss [31], [32]. The supervised\nmetric space supports fine-tuning using minimal adaptation\ndata (also known as support set), and the similarity function\ngeneralizes to unknown test data [33], [34]. Motivated by the\nidea of few-shot learning methods, our approach first learns a\njoint metric space that encodes object attributes and then fine-\ntunes recognition and grasping of our model when testing on\nnovel objects.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\nIII. PROBLEM FORMULATION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe attribute-based robotic grasping problem in this paper\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nis formulated as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nDefinition 1. Given a query text for a target object, the goal\nfor the robot is to grasp the corresponding object that is placed\nin the cluttered workspace.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo handle the natural language that is diverse and uncon-\nstrained, we assume a language attribute parser, such as [35],\nand make the following assumption:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAssumption 1. The query text is parsed into the keywords of\nobject attributes as an input to the robotic grasping model.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe consider color, shape, and category name attributes in\nthis paper, while the proposed approach is extensible to other\nattributes (e.g., texture, pose, and functionality, etc.). In order\nto make object recognition tractable, we have the following\nassumption regarding object placement:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAssumption 2. The objects are stably placed within the\nworkspace, and there is no stacking between objects.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWhile we show robotic grasping as a manipulation example\nin this paper, the proposed attribute-based learning methods\nshould be, in principle, extensible to other robotic manipula-\ntion skills, such as suction, pushing, and placing.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nIV. LEARNING ATTRIBUTE-BASED GRASPING\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nObject attributes are semantically meaningful features and\nserve as an intermediate representation for object recognition\nand manipulation. In this section, we propose an end-to-\nend neural network for attribute-based robotic grasping. The\nproposed model takes as input an image of visual observation\nand a text of target description to predict pixel-wise instance\ngrasping affordances. To acquire a rich dataset for training,\nwe build a simulation environment that allows domain ran-\ndomization with diverse objects. In simulation, the model is\npre-trained to learn instance grasping and object attributes\nsimultaneously.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nA. Learning Grasping Affordances\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe formulate attribute-based grasping as a mapping from\npairs of workspace images and query text to target grasping\naffordances. The proposed visual-textual manipulation archi-\ntecture assumes no prior linguistic or perceptual knowledge.\nIt consists of two modules, a multimodal encoder and an\naffordances decoder, as illustrated in Fig. 2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nMultimodal Encoder: As shown in Fig. 1a, our robot\nsystem uses an overhead RGB-D camera to capture the\nworkspace. The RGB-D image is projected into a 3-D point\ncloud and then orthographically back-projected in the gravity\ndirection to construct a heightmap image vpre of RGB and\nin the image as the\ndepth channel. To specify an object\ngrasping target, we give a text command t composed of color\nand/or shape attributes, e.g., “red cuboid”. The workspace\nimage vpre and query text t are the input to visual spatial\nrespectively. We use\nencoder ϕv,spa and text encoder ϕt\nthe ImageNet-pretrained [36] ResNet-18 [37] backbone as\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFig. 2: Overview of affordances and attribute learning. The workspace image and query text are encoded separately and fused using\ngated-attention. The fusion matrix Fatt is rotated by N orientations for different grasping angles and then fed into the grasping affordances\ndecoder. The decoder learns to predict pixel-wise scores of target grasping success, and we run the ϵ-greedy grasping policy and obtain the\nimage vpost after grasping. By utilizing the equation of object persistence before and after grasping, we learn a metric space where multimodal\nembedding vectors corresponding to similar attributes are encouraged to be closer. Note we denote the combination of ϕv,spa and GAP as\nϕv,vec, which encodes images to vectors.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nour image encoder ϕv,spa. We replace the first convolutional\nlayer of the ResNet backbone with a 4-channel convolutional\nlayer to match the RGB-D heightmap input. The encoder\nencodes the RGB and depth observation into 3D visual matrix\nφv,spa ∈ RH×W ×512. The text encoder ϕt is a deep averaging\nnetwork [38] represented by three fully-connected layers and\ninterleaved ReLU [39] activation functions. We first map each\ntoken in a sentence text to an embeddings vector of 128\ndimension. The mean token embeddings (i.e., continuous bag-\nof-words [40] model) of the text are input to the 3-layer MLP\ntext encoder to produce a text vector φt ∈ R512. The visual\nmatrix φv,spa and the text vector φt are then fused by the gated-\nattention mechanism [41]: each element of φt is repeated and\nexpanded to an H × W matrix to match the dimension of\nφv,spa. The expanded matrix is multiplied element-wise with\nφv,spa to produce a fusion matrix Fatt. The gated-attention unit\nis designed to gate certain pixels in the visual feature matrix\nmatching to the text vector, resulting in the fusion matrix\ncontaining the visual features selected by the query text. By\nthis means, we can detect different attributes of the objects in\nthe image, such as color and shape.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhich predicts pixel-wise scores of horizontal grasps within\nthe rotated heightmaps. The pixel with the highest score among\nall the N maps determines the parameters (i.e., location and\nangle) for the grasping primitive to be executed. As in Fig. 2,\nour model predicts accurate target grasping location and valid\n(e.g., the selected angles for the red cuboid) target grasping\nangle.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe motion loss Lgrasp, which supervises the entire\nencoder-decoder networks, is the error from predictions of\ngrasping affordances:\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nLgrasp =\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n\n(qe − ¯qe)2 + λM\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhere Ns is the size of the dataset\nis collected in\nsimulation, qe is the grasping score in Qg at the executed\nlocation, and ¯qe is the ground-truth label (see Sec. IV-C). The\nsecond term ensures lower grasping scores for the pixels in\nbackground mask M (obtained from the depth image) with\nweight λM [43], and qi is the grasping score of a background\npixel.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAffordances Decoder: Grasping affordances decoder ϕg is\na fully-convolutional residual network [37], [42] interleaved\nwith spatial bilinear 4× upsampling and ended with the\nthe fusion\nsigmoid function. The decoder takes as input\nmatrix Fatt and outputs a unit-ranged map Qg with the same\nsize and resolution as the input image vpre. Each value of\na pixel qi ∈ Qg represents the predicted score of target\ngrasping success when executing a top-down grasp at the\ncorresponding 3D location with a parallel-jaw gripper oriented\nhorizontally concerning the map Qg. The grasping primitive\nis parameterized by a 3-D location and an angle. To examine\ndifferent grasping angles, we rotate the input Fatt by N = 6\n(multiples of 30◦) orientations before feeding into the decoder,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nB. Learning Multimodal Attributes\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo learn generic object attributes, we perform multimodal\nattributes learning, where visual or textual embedding vectors\ncorresponding to similar attributes are encouraged to be closer\nin the latent space. Inspired by [13], we take advantage of the\nobject persistence: the embedding difference of the scene be-\nfore and after grasping is enforced closer to the representation\nof the grasped object. During data collection, we record image-\ntext data (vpre, vpost, t), where vpre and vpost are the workspace\nimage before and after grasping respectively, and t is the query\ntext that describes attributes of the grasped object.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe add one layer of global average pooling (GAP) [44],\n[45] at the end of the encoder ϕv,spa and denote the network\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 4: Examples of basic objects.

We express the\nlogic of the object persistence as an arithmetic constraint on\nvisual and textual vectors such that (ϕv,vec(vpre)−ϕv,vec(vpost))\nis close to ϕt(t). We use the triplet loss [46] to approximate\nthe constraint, and the set of triplets T is defined as\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\ni ) | s(afi, af +\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n) > s(afi, af −\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nwhere fi, f +\nare random samples from the pool\ni\nof vectors (ϕv,vec(vpre) − ϕv,vec(vpost)) and ϕt(t), and af is\nan n-dimensional attribute label vector corresponding to the\nfeature vector f (e.g., color, shape, and category name, etc.).\nFunction s(·, ·) is an attribute similarity function that evaluates\nthe similarity between two attribute label vectors:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n1 = a i\nif a i\notherwise\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nwhere a i denotes the i-th element of the label vector a,\nand the indicator function 1(·, ·) evaluates the element-wise\nsimilarity. Note that 0 indicates null attribute meaning no\nattribute is specified in the label. As an example, suppose we\nhave the dictionary dict = {“eos” : 0, “red” : 1, “black” :\n2, “yellow” : 3, “cylinder” : 4, “cube” : 5};\nthen, “red\ncylinder” can be represented as a label vector af0 = [1, 4], and\n“red cube” can be represented as af1 = [1, 5]. The similarity\nbetween the two label vectors is computed using (3) such\nthat s(af0 , af1 ) = s([1, 4], [1, 5]) = 0.5. Additionally, when\n“red” and “black” are used without any additional attribute\ndescription, they are mapped to the vectors [1, 0] and [2, 0],\nrespectively. In this case,\nthe similarity between the two\nlabels is derived as s([1, 0], [2, 0]) = 0. With the triplets of\nembedding vectors, multimodal metric loss Lattr is defined\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo achieve self-supervision, we create a simulation envi-\nronment in which objects are identified and grasped based on\na description of semantic attributes. We collect training data\nin simulation with the following procedure, as summarized\nin Algorithm 1. Several objects are randomly dropped into\nthe workspace in front of the robot. Given a workspace\nimage and a query text, the robot learns to grasp a target\nunder ϵ-greedy exploration [47] (ϵ = 0 during testing, i.e.,\nan argmax policy). We save the workspace images, query\ntext, background masks, executed actions, and results into\na bounded buffer. The ground-truth labels are automatically\ngenerated for learning grasping affordances. The label ¯qe in\n(1) is assigned as the attribute similarity in (3) between the\nquery text and the grasped object (0 if no object grasped).\nWe also save the workspace image after a successful grasping\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n(a) Adversarial Adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n(a) Simulated novel objects\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.5**\n(b) Real-world objects\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 5: Testing objects in simulation and the real world. We use the\ntesting objects that share similar attributes with the training objects.\nSee Appendix for more details.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nfor learning object attributes. To deal with sparse rewards in\ntarget-driven grasping, the hindsight experience replay (HER)\ntechnique [48] is applied. If a non-target is grasped, we add\nthe additional positive sample by relabeling the target text. Fig.\n4 shows the basic objects of various colors (red, green, blue,\nyellow, and black) and shapes (cube, cuboid, cylinder, and\nsphere) used in our simulation. We choose these colors and\nshapes because they are foundational for common objects in\ndaily life. To enrich the distribution of training data, we perturb\ncolor RGB values, randomize sizes and heights of the objects,\nand randomize textures of the workspace. Using the domain\nrandomization techniques [24], we can generate a number of\nrandomized properties in simulation and achieve a model with\nbetter generalization. At every iteration, we sample a batch\nfrom the buffer and run one off-policy training. The training\nloss is defined as\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\nLtrain = Lgrasp + λaLattr\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nby combining both motion loss Lgrasp (1) and metric loss\nLattr (5). We train the proposed model using stochastic\ngradient descent with a learning rate of 10−4, momentumn\nof 0.9, and weight decay of 2 × 10−5 for 5k iterations.\nEach training iteration involves capturing data, computing a\nforward pass, executing an action, and backpropagating. After\ncollecting a dataset of 5k samples, we replay the entire data\nfor 100 epochs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\nV. DATA-EFFICIENT ADAPTATION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDue to the high cost of collecting data on real robots, we\noften choose to train robotic models in a simulator. However,\nthe domain gap between the source domain (e.g., simulation,\ntrained objects) and the target domain (e.g., the real world,\nnovel objects) frequently leads to the failure of the learned\nmodels. We propose to, in addition to randomizing the source\ndomain in Sec. IV-C, adapt our learned model using data\nfrom the target domain to further alleviate the domain shifts.\nOne typical adaptation approach is fine-tuning the pre-trained\nmodel. However, the fine-tuning methods remain expensive in\nterms of data usage. In this section, as shown in Fig. 6, we\npropose two data-efficient adaptation methods: 1) adversarial\nadaptation, which adapts the image encoder using unlabeled\nimages, and 2) one-grasp adaptation, which updates the end-\nto-end model using one grasp trial. The two adaptation meth-\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n(b) One-Grasp Adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 6: Overview of the proposed adaptation schemes. In ad-\nversarial adaptation (top), the adversarial loss Ladv regulates the\nimage encoder using augmented data of unlabeled images to learn\ndomain-invariant features for the decoder. The dotted boxes indicate\nno gradient flows corresponding to Ladv (there are gradients from\nLtrain though). One-grasp adaptation updates the end-to-end model\nthrough Lgrasp using augmented data from one grasp trial.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nods can be either used independently or in combination for\nperformance improvement.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nA. Adversarial Adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nDespite that our generic model trained using the simulated\nbasic objects shows good generalization (see Sec. VII-B), the\nvisual feature shifts (e.g., objects, lighting conditions, and\nscene configurations, etc.) are inevitable. As a result,\nthe\nimage encoder is likely to produce out-of-distribution visual\nembeddings, leading to the failure of the grasping model.\nTo reduce the influence of the domain shifts, we propose\nto use adversarial adaptation [28] to learn domain-invariant\nvisual features that are transferable across different domains.\nIn our problem setup, the simulated basic objects constitute the\nsource domain, and our goal is to transfer the learned model\nto a target domain that is prone to domain shifts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs shown in Fig. 6a, adversarial adaptation regularizes\nthe weights of the image encoder ϕv by enforcing a two-\nplayer game similar to the generative adversarial network\n(GAN) [49]. A domain classifier (i.e., discriminator) learns to\ndistinguish between two domains, while the image encoder\nlearns to fool\nthe domain classifier by learning domain-\ninvariant features. To achieve adversarial training, we connect\nthe encoder and the discriminator via a gradient reversal layer\n(GRL) [50] that has reverse forward and back-propagation\nschemes. The GRL R is an identity mapping during forward-\npropagation but reverses the sign of the gradients during back-\npropagation:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nR(x) = x\ndR\ndx\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhere I is an identity matrix, and λr is a positive constant.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nobject images\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nextracted objects\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\naugmented image\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 7: Object-level data augmentation. We extract objects from\nthe images of a single object, apply the augmentation methods (e.g.,\nshifting, rotation), and assemble them on a background to generate\ndiverse adaptation data for adversarial adaptation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\none-grasp collection\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\ncollected data\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\naugmented data\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 8: One-grasp data augmentation. We place the target object\nsolely on the workspace and collect one successful grasp. To enrich\nthe distribution of grasping angles, we rotate the collected data and\nsynthesize a few samples for one-grasp adaptation. One rotation\nexample of the augmented data is visualized.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDuring adaptation, images from the two different domains\nare fed into the image encoder. The domain classifier fd\ntakes as input the encoded features, and is trained to predict\nwhich domain the feature is from, by maximizing the binary\ncross-entropy Hd. Using the source domain dataset Ds =\n{vs , ts , ys }Ns ({image, text, label} collected in Algorithm 1)\nand assuming a target domain dataset Dt = {vt }Nt , the model\nis updated to be optimal on the training loss Ltrain (6) under\nthe regularization of the adversarial loss Ladv\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nvi∈Ds ∪Dt\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.5**\nHd(fd(R(ϕv,vec(vi))), di)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nLadvadp = Ltrain(vs , ts , ys ) + Ladv(vt )\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nwhere Ladvadp is the overall loss for adversarial adaptation,\ndi ∈ {0, 1} are the binary domain label for each input vi. Note\nthat the reversal layer R is augmented between the classifier fd\nand the encoder ϕv,vec and updates them in reversal directions.\nThe target dataset Dt for the new domain is the prerequisite\nto performing adversarial adaptation. As shown in Fig. 7,\nwe propose a object-level augmentation (ObjectAug) approach\ninstead of collecting data from a vast number of configurations.\nSince the grasping label is not required in Dt , synthetic gen-\neration of a large image dataset would be more efficient. We\nbegin by collecting RGB-D images of all conceivable objects\nin the target domain. Using the object mask acquired from\nthe depth channel, we extract each object individually and\nrandomize them with the single-object augmentation methods\ncommonly used (e.g., scaling, flipping, and rotation). To\ngenerate an augmented RGB-D image, the augmented objects\nare randomly sampled and shifted before being overlaid with a\nbackground image. We also perform IoU threshold verification\nto avoid dense overlapping. To simulate varying conditions\nof target domains, we can apply the visual jitter technique\ndiscussed in Sec. VI-A to obtain more diverse data. Given the\nease with which unlabeled images may be acquired (e.g., the\ninternet, image collection), generating a target dataset that is\nof the same magnitude as the source dataset is rather efficient.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nimage encoder and leave the text encoder and the grasping\naffordance decoder unadapted. When deploying in a new\ndomain, end-to-end model fine-tuning is often necessary, but\nthis comes at the cost of a large dataset covering all potential\ntesting object configurations. To further adapt to novel objects\nand new scenes in a data-efficient manner, we present a one-\ngrasp adaptation scheme (see Fig. 6b) that only requires one\nsuccessful grasp of a novel object. The inductive bias of\nobject attributes in Sec. IV-B is the key to adaptation in this\nlimited-data regime. If similar objects are enforced closer in\nthe embedding space, the adaptation distance for a novel object\nis likely to be shorter [51].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe proposed one-grasp adaptation method improves the\nmodel performance on a novel target object at the cost of only\none grasp. The adaptation data is collected with the following\none-grasp data augmentation (OneGraspAug) procedure. We\nplace the object solely in the workspace and run the generic\nmodel to collect one successful grasp. The setting of a sole\nobject facilitates grasping and avoids combinatorial object\narrangements. Because convolutional neural networks are not\nrotation-invariant by design, we also augment the grasp data\nby rotating with various orientations to achieve rotation-\ninvariance [52], [53], i.e., the ability to recognize and grasp\nan object regardless of its orientation. As shown in Fig. 8, we\nrotate the collected image and action execution to have rotated\nversions of the collected data.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the adaptation stage, we add the category name of the\nobject as an additional token to the query text, e.g., “apple, red\nsphere” for the testing object apple. The token embedding of\nthe object name is initialized properly to keep the embedding\nvector of the query text unchanged. The addition of the\nobject name allows for a more specific grasping instruction\nand distinguishing from similar objects via adaptation. By\noptimizing over motion loss Lgrasp in (1), we jointly fine-\ntune the recognition and grasping of our model for unknown\nobjects and scenes. As delineated in Sec. VII-C, the adapted\nmodel outputs higher affordances on the target objects that are\nnot seen and grasped before.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nBy learning domain-invariant features, the adversarial adap-\ntation technique in Sec. V-A improves model generalization\nusing unlabeled images of the target domain.

We simulate a statically mounted overhead\n3D camera in the environment from which perception data is\ncaptured. The camera renders RGB-D images with a 640×480\npixels resolution using OpenGL. We use various basic and\nnovel objects for training and testing in the simulation. As\nshown in Fig. 4, the basic objects consist of 36 different 3D toy\nblocks, whose shapes and colors are randomly chosen during\nexperiments. We collect 34 different 3D household objects\nfrom the YCB dataset [55] or the 3D mesh library SketchUp\n[56], as shown in Fig. 5a. To produce more diverse simulation\nconfigurations, the simulation environment supports several\ndomain randomization techniques, including background ran-\ndomization, color jitter (i.e., randomly changing the brightness,\ncontrast, and saturation of the color channel), and depth jitter\n(i.e., adding Gaussian noise to the depth channel).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nB.

We use the soft fingers because they are more\nsuitable for grasping the objects in our experiments and are\nsimilarly compliant to the RG2 fingers. For perception data,\nRGB-D images of resolution 640 × 480 are captured from\nthe RGB-D camera, statically mounted on the robot arm. The\ncamera is localized with respect to the robot base using the\nautomatic calibration procedure of ViSP [57], during which the\ncamera tracks the location of a checkerboard pattern taped on\nthe table. For a given pose, the robot follows the corresponding\ntrajectory generated with MoveIt [58] in open-loop. The entire\nsystem is implemented under the Robot Operating System\n(ROS) framework and runs on a PC workstation with an Intel\ni7-8700 CPU and an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU. Objects vary\nthroughout tests, with a collection of 20+ different household\nobjects being used to test model generalization to novel\nobjects, as shown in Fig. 5b.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\nVII.

This computation\nobtains an attention heatmap over the image, which refers to\nthe similarity between the query text and each pixel’s receptive\nfield (see Fig. 9a).

During training, we\nuse both the motion loss and the metric loss to update the\nmodel.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n5) NoMetric is for an ablation study of multimodal metric\nloss. We simply remove the metric loss on the basis of\nour approach during its training.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nEvaluation metrics: These methods have different\ntarget\nrecognition schemes: ClassIndis and EncoderIndis recognize\na target by classification and text template matching respec-\ntively; NoMetric, AttrID and Ours are end-to-end. We report\ntheir target recognition performance (in addition to instance\ngrasping performance, as in the next paragraph). A target\nlocalization is correct only if the predicted grasping location\nlies on the target object. The instance grasping success rate is\ndefined as # of successful grasps on correct target\n. In each testing scene,\n# of total grasps\nwe only execute grasping once.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe evaluate the methods on both simulated basic (sim basic)\nand simulated novel (sim novel) objects in simulation, where\nthere are 1200 test cases for the basic objects (Fig. 4) and 3400\ntest cases for the 34 novel objects (Fig. 5a, mostly from the\nYCB dataset [55]). We assume the objects are placed right-\nside up to be stable while their 4D pose (3D position and a\nyaw angle) can vary arbitrarily. For each testing object, we\npre-choose a query text that best describes its color and/or\nshape. In each test case, four objects are randomly sampled and\nplaced in the workspace, except avoiding any two objects with\nthe same attributes. The robot is required to grasp the target\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nqueried by an attribute text. We report the results of target\nrecognition in Table I and the results of instance grasping in\nTable II.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOverall, our approach outperforms the baselines remarkably\n(in both recognition and grasping) and achieves a 98.4%\ngrasping success rate on the simulated basic objects and an\n72.1% grasping success rate on the simulated novel objects.\nClassIndis extends Indiscriminate that is well trained in target-\nagnostic tasks and performs well on the basic objects, but the\nattributes classifier generalizes poorly. EncoderIndis utilizes a\nmore generalizable recognition module and performs better on\nthe novel objects. However, EncoderIndis fails to reach opti-\nmality because its separately-trained recognition and grasping\nmodules have different training objectives from instance grasp-\ning. Despite training the recognition and grasping modules\nsimultaneously, AttrID using sparse attribute one-hot IDs as\na substitute for text inputs yields lower recognition accuracy\nand grasping success rate compared to Ours. As an ablation\nstudy, the performance gap between NoMetric and Ours shows\nthe effectiveness of multimodal metric loss, which supervises\nthe joint latent space to produce consistent embeddings, as\ndiscussed in Sec. VII-A. Our approach successfully learns\nobject attributes that generalize well to novel objects, as shown\nin Fig. 9.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe further evaluate our approach and the baselines on the\nreal robot before any adaptation (see Table I and II). Fig.\n5b shows 21 testing objects of various colors and shapes\nused in our real-robot experiments. The robot is tasked to\ngrasp the target within a combination of 6 objects placed\non the table. We use the same 21 object combinations that\nare randomly generated and repeat each combination twice,\nresulting in a total of 252 grasping trials for each method.\nOverall, the grasping performance of all the methods decreases\ndue to the domain gap. However, our approach shows the best\ngeneralization and achieves a 63.1% grasping success rate,\nbefore adaptation, in the real-world scenes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nC.

Overall, our generic model\ndemonstrates good generalization despite the gaps in the\ntesting scenes. Specifically, these gaps are 1) RGB values\nof the testing objects deviate from training ranges, 2) some\ntesting objects are multi-colored, 3) shape and size differences\nbetween the testing objects and the training objects, and 4)\ndepth noises in the real world causing imperfect object shapes.\nTo account for the gaps, we further adapt our generic model\nto increase instance recognition and grasping performance.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe first collect one successful grasp of a solely placed target\nobject and then augment the collected data by rotating with\nadditional N − 1 angles, as discussed in Sec.

VII-B.\nWe also update Indiscriminative grasping in ClassIndis and\nEncoderIndis. We keep the experimental setup the same with\nSec. VII-B and evaluate the instance grasping performance of\nthe adapted models. We report the adapted instance grasping\nsuccess rate in Table III and the adaptation gains in Fig. 10.\nThe attributes classifier in ClassIndis suffers from insufficient\nadaptation data, limiting its target recognition and adaptation\nperformance. While EncoderIndis minimizes embedding dis-\ntances in its latent space and shows better performance, it is\nstill worse than One-Grasp. By fine-tuning over the structured\nmetric space, One-Grasp updates the end-to-end model and\nimproves target recognition and grasping jointly. At the cost of\nminimal data collection, One-Grasp achieves an 83.7% grasp-\ning success rate on the simulated novel objects and an 76.6%\ngrasping success rate on the real objects, which shows the\nsignificant adaptation gains. On the contrary, the unstructured\nlatent space in NoMetric limits its adaptation, demonstrating\nthe importance of attributes learning for grasping affordances\nlearning. The difference in adaptation performance between\nNoMetric and One-Grasp demonstrates the significance of\nthe regulated feature space in adaptation. Furthermore, the\nsubstantial adaptation gain observed in AttrID validates the\napplicability of our adaptation method with sparse feature\ninputs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs an improvement, we propose applying Adversarial adap-\ntation on the image encoder to learn domain-invariant features\nbefore One-Grasp adaptation. The image encoder’s domain\ninvariancy results in superior transferring performance for\nAdversarial+One-Grasp: an instance grasping success rate of\n86.0% in the domain of sim novel and 81.7% in the domain\nof real-world novel (real novel). The qualitative results in Fig.\n11 suggest the efficacy of the two adaptation methods: 1) both\nAdversarial adaptation and One-Grasp adaptation increase the\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\n(a) Generic model before adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n(b) Adversarial adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n(c) One-Grasp adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n(d) Adversarial+One-Grasp adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 11: Visualization of grasping maps before and after adap-\ntation. (a) shows the grasping affordances from the generic model\ntrained only with simulated basic objects, and (b) to (d) show the\naffordances from the adapted models after Adversarial, One-Grasp,\nand Adversarial+One-Grasp adaptation, respectively. Our adaptation\nmethods, which require only a limited amount of adaptation data,\neffectively enhance model performance.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nrecognition and grasping performance of the models, and 2)\nAdversarial adaptation minimizes grasping noises around non-\ntarget objects (by reducing domain feature changes), while\nOne-Grasp adaptation can rectify recognition and grasping\nerrors through end-to-end updates. The more compact and\ncentered contour in Fig. 11b could be explained by the\nhypothesis that domain-invariant features improve the output\nconsistency of the encoder across domains. The corrected\ntarget recognition in Fig. 11c, on the other hand, is attributed\nto the One-Grasp adaptation which effectively shifts the af-\nfordances from irrelevant objects to the target object through\nthe end-to-end model updates. Another noteworthy finding is\nthat the combined adaptation Adversarial+One-Grasp appears\nto benefit from both Adversarial adaptation and One-Grasp\nadaptation, as their focuses are complementary.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nD. Comparison with a Foundation Model\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn addition to the instance grasping experiments, we per-\nform another quantitative evaluation of the adapted model\non sim novel objects. For comparison, we utilize the CLIP\nmodel [59], a recently prevailing multimodal (text and image)\nfoundation model. CLIP aligns language and image features\nthrough training with millions of text-image pairs and is\nwidely acclaimed for its robust generalization capability across\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe proposed adaptation approaches efficiently improve the\ninstance grasping performance of our model. As discussed in\nSec. VII-C, the finding that the approaches have complemen-\ntary adaptation focuses leads to one of the major features: the\ntwo adaptation methods can be employed individually or in\ncombination, depending on the availability of adaptation data.\nTo investigate their independent and combinative performance,\nwe conduct an ablation study to compare the grasping models\nas follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n1) Generic is the baseline generic model obtained in Sec.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\nVII-B before any adaptation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2) Adversarial adapts the generic model to learn domain-\ninvariant features using a large augmented data, as dis-\ncussed in Sec. V-A.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n3) One-Grasp adapts the generic model using one grasping\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\ntrial of the target object, as discussed in Sec. V-B.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n4) Adversarial+One-Grasp applies the two adaptation ap-\nproaches on the generic model sequentially to improve\nthe recognition and grasping.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs shown in Fig. 14, the adaptation methods are compared in\nfour testing environments with an increasing extent of domain\nshifts: 1) sim basic jitter—simulated basic objects with visual\njitter (see Sec. VI-A) applied on color and depth channels as\nwell as background, 2) sim novel—simulated novel objects, 3)\nsim novel jitter—simulated novel objects with visual jitter, and\n4) real novel—real novel objects. As the training environment\nuses simulated basic objects, the testing environments include\nthe domain shifts caused by novel objects, visual jitter, and\nreal-world noises.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe report the experimental results of the instance grasp-\ning success rate in Fig. 13. Overall, all adaptation methods\nimprove the grasping performance across the testing envi-\nronments. It is not surprising that adaptation is likely to be\nmore effective (i.e., leading to more performance increments)\nif the domain shifts are severer. For example, the adaptation\ngain in the environment of sim basic jitter is less than\n4%, while the real environment witnesses an adaptation gain\nof over 18%. Moreover, when encountering complex novel\nobjects that are more challenging (e.g., drill) than the basic\nthe One-Grasp method\ntraining objects (e.g., red cuboid),\nprovides more adaptation power than the Adversarial method.\nIn Adversarial adaptation, we use unlabeled data from the\ntarget domain to update the image encoder, while the text\nencoder and grasping decoder remain unadapted. As a result,\nthe Adversarial adapted model is more prone to encountering\ndifficulties with challenging novel objects (e.g., drill and\nspatula). On the other hand, One-Grasp adaptation adapts\nthe entire model and demonstrates better performance on\nthese challenging objects, but it requires additional labeled\ndata (at least one grasp) of the objects. Another observa-\ntion is that we can combine the two adaptation methods\nto achieve an even higher adaptation performance. Through\nvarious tests, the combined method Adversarial+One-Grasp\nadaptation consistently shows the best performance in all the\ntesting environments. This suggests that the two adaptation\nmethods adapt our model complementarily for accumulative\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n(a) CLIP matching scores\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n(b) Adversarial+One-Grasp scores\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 12: The visualization of confusion matrices.

To evaluate the performance of CLIP, we\nsegment and crop randomly placed objects in the workspace.\nFor each object crop and its attribute text description, the\nCLIP model calculates a matching score, which is then used\nto construct the confusion matrix shown in Fig. 12a. The\npairwise matching scores reflect the similarity between the\nobject crops and the text inputs. As for our Adversarial+One-\nGrasp model, we compute another confusion matrix shown in\nFig. 12b by collecting the highest affordance value, under each\ntarget attribute description, from affordance maps Qg within\neach object’s segmentation mask. While CLIP matching uses\ncropped images of single objects, Adversarial+One-Grasp is\ntested using workspace images of multiple objects, which is a\nmore natural but also more challenging setting. Fig. 12 shows\nthat Adversarial+One-Grasp achieves more accurate ground-\ning of the correct target objects. In contrast, the matching\nscores produced by the CLIP model often lack discrimination,\nleading to some misclassifications (e.g., “sphere soccer” and\n“yellow cylinder yellowcup”). This comparison highlights the\nlimitations of zero-shot generalization in a foundation model\nand showcases the effectiveness of our adaptation method.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFig. 13: Adaptation performance in the designed testing environments.

CONCLUSION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this work, we presented a novel attribute-based robotic\ngrasping system. An end-to-end architecture was proposed to\nlearn object attributes and manipulation jointly. Workspace\nimages and query text were encoded into a joint metric space,\nwhich was further supervised by object persistence before and\nafter grasping. Our model was self-supervised in a simulation\nonly using basic objects but showed good generalization.\nTo further adapt to novel objects and real-world scenes, we\nproposed two data-efficient adaptation methods, adversarial\nadaptation and one-grasp adaptation, which only require un-\nlabeled object images or one grasp trial. Our grasping system\nachieved an 86.0% instance grasping success rate in simulation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nand an 81.7% instance grasping success rate in the real world,\nboth on unknown objects. Our approach outperformed the\nother compared methods by large margins.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe showed that incorporating object attributes in robotic\ngrasping improves the performance of the deep learning grasp-\ning model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to explore object attributes for the generalization and\nadaptation of deep learning robotic grasping models. Our long-\nterm goal is to further improve the effectiveness and robustness\nof our model by pre-training it with objects of richer attributes.\nAnother possible avenue for future work is to study object\nattributes under partial observation, such as the shape of an\nobject in dense clutter. It would be of interest to explore how\nto achieve more robust attribute perception, potentially using\nshape completion algorithms.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nREFERENCES\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n[1] Y.

         " Yang Yang, Houjian Yu, Xibai Lou, Yuanhao Liu, and Changhyun Choi   O BJECT attributes are generalizable properties in object   manipulation. Imagine how we describe a novel object when asking someone to fetch it, “Please give me the apple, a red sphere.”, we intuitively characterize the target by its appearance attributes (see Fig. 1). If an assistive robot can   be similarly commanded utilizing such object attributes (e.g., color, shape, and category name, etc.), it would allow better generalization capability for novel objects than using a discrete set of pre-defined category labels. Moreover, individuals learn to recognize and grasp an unknown object through rapid interactions; hence, it would be advantageous if a grasping pipeline is capable of adapting with minimal adaptation data. These factors motivate the development of attribute-based robotic grasping with data-efficient adaptation capability.   Recognizing and grasping a target object in clutter is crucial for an autonomous robot to perform daily-life tasks in the real world. Over the past years, the robotics community has made substantial progress in target-driven robotic grasping by combining off-the-shelf object recognition modules with data- driven grasping models [2], [3]. However, these recognition- based approaches presume a unique ID for each category and are likely to experience limited generalization when applied to novel objects. In contrast, we propose an attribute-based robotic grasping approach that enables a robot to grasp an attributes-specified target object. The intuition of using at- tributes for grasping is that the grounded attributes can help transfer object recognition and grasping capabilities across different environments.   Suffering from domain shift [4], a machine learning model trained with the data in one domain is subject to limited generalization when tested in another domain. In robotic grasping, the source of domain shifts includes novel objects, new environments, perception noises, etc. To mitigate the domain shift, domain adaptation methods [5] are widely used for model transfer. These adaptation methods, on the other   hand, typically require the collection of a large adaption dataset, which is costly, inefficient, and time-consuming. To efficiently transfer our pre-trained attribute-based grasping model, we present two tailored adaptation methods. Both the two proposed adaptation methods are data-efficient, requiring minimal data collecting and labeling.   Compared to recognition-based robotic grasping (i.e., em- ploying pre-trained recognition modules), the challenges of attribute-based grasping are 1) mapping from workspace im- ages and query text of the target to robot motions, 2) asso- ciating abstract attributes with raw pixels, 3) data labeling in target-driven grasping, and 4) data-efficient adaptation to unknown objects and new scenes. In this paper, we design an architecture that consists of a multimodal encoder (i.e., encoding both visual and textual data) and an affordances decoder (i.e., predicting instance grasping affordances [6]). The key aspects of our system are:   • We design the deep grasping neural networks that rep- resent 3-DOF grasp poses. After encoding and fusing visual-textual representations, the networks rotate the fused features to account for different grasping angles, and then predict pixel-wise instance grasping affordances. • To learn a multimodal metric space, we employ the equation of object persistence before and after grasping; the visual embedding of a grasped object should be equal to the textual embedding of that object.   • Our model learns object attributes that generalize to new objects and scenes by only using basic objects (of various colors and shapes) in simulation.   • With the pre-trained attribute representations, our model supports efficient adaptation with minimal data. Ad- versarial adaptation regulates the image encoder with augmented data of unlabeled images, whereas one-grasp adaptation updates the end-to-end model with augmented data requiring only one successful grasp trial. Both adaption approaches are data-efficient, and they can be employed independently or in combination to improve instance grasping performance.   The deep grasping model in our approach is fully self- supervised through the interactions between the robot and objects. Fig. 1 presents an example of attribute-based robotic grasping, wherein our approach successfully grounds object attributes and accurately predicts grasping affordances for an attributes-specified target object.   In our prior work [1], we proposed 1) an end-to-end architecture for learning text-commanded robotic manipulation and 2) a method of self-supervising multimodal attribute em- beddings through object grasping to facilitate quick adaptation. As an evolved paper, this article presents an in-depth study of adaptation in robotic manipulation and strives to improve the autonomy of robots by achieving self-supervision and self-adaptation. The pre-trained model is self-supervised in a simulation that only uses basic objects of various colors and shapes. In our adaptation framework, we make use of autonomous robots to collect raw data for adaptation. We present three core technical contributions as follows:   1) A sequential adaptation scheme. We propose a robotic grasping adaptation framework that comprises two stack-   able and data-efficient adaptation methods. The adversar- ial adaptation and one-grasp adaptation methods aim to comprehensively adapt the model for object recognition and grasping. Through data-efficient adaptation, the robot adeptly grasps challenging objects, eliminating the need for extensive data collection.   2) Data-efficient augmentation methods. We design data augmentation methods that only require unlabeled images of candidate objects for adversarial adaptation and one- grasp data of a target object for one-grasp adaptation. 3) Evaluation and analysis of robot grasping. We evaluate the grasping model in simulated and real-world scenes with various testing objects and domain gaps, which veri- fies the effectiveness of our grasping model. Furthermore, the ablative analysis of the data augmentation methods shows the efficiency of our approach.   With observations from an RGB-D camera, our robot system is designed to grasp a target object following the user command containing object attributes. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explores object attributes to improve the generalization and adaptation of deep robotic grasping models. We believe that the adaptation framework not only enhances the overall performance but also opens up new possibilities for solving the problem in target-driven robotic manipulation.   Though there are different taxonomies, the existing work of robotic grasping can be roughly divided according to approaches and tasks: 1) model-driven [7] and data-driven [8] approaches; 2) indiscriminate [9] [10] and instance grasping [2] tasks. Our approach is data-driven and focuses on instance grasping. Typical instance grasping pipelines assume a pre- trained object recognition module (e.g., detection [2], seg- mentation [3] [11], template matching [12], and object repre- sentation [13], etc.), limiting the generalization for unknown objects and the scalability of grasping pipelines. Our model is end-to-end and exploits object attributes for generaliza- tion. Some recent research also proposes end-to-end learning methods for instance robotic grasping. [14] learns to predict the grasp configuration for an object class with a learning framework composed of object detection, classification, and grasp planning. In [15], CCAN, an attention-based network, learns to locate the target object and predict the corresponding grasp affordances given a query image. Compared to these methods, the main features of our work are two-fold. First, we collect a much smaller dataset of synthetic basic objects to learn generic attribute-based grasping. Moreover, our generic grasping model is capable of further adapting to new objects and domains. Second, our approach takes a description text of target attributes as a query command, which is more flexible when grasping a novel object.   Object attributes are middle-level abstractions of object properties and generalizable across object categories [16]. Learning object attributes has been widely studied in the tasks   of object recognition [17], [18], [19], [20], while attribute- based robotic grasping has been much less explored, except for [21], [22]. Cohen et al. [21] developed a robotic system to pick up the target object corresponding to a description of attributes. Their approach minimizes the cosine similarity loss between visual and textual embeddings as well as predicts ob- ject attributes. However, they only show generalization across viewpoints but not object categories. In [22], the proposed Text2Pickup system uses object attributes to specify a target object and removes ambiguities in the user’s command. They use mono-color blocks as training and testing objects but fail to show generalization to novel objects. In contrast, our work learns generic attribute-based robotic grasping (only using synthetic basic objects) and generalizes well to novel objects and real-world scenes.   Model generalization is one of the most important chal- lenges in robotic manipulation. To improve model generaliza- tion, various approaches to bridging domain gaps have been proposed. Domain randomization [23] is one frequently used method, which collects more diverse data by randomizing simulation settings. Some recent research [24], [25], [26] have applied domain randomization to improve the real-world generalization of a simulation-trained robot policy. We build a simulation environment and apply domain randomization during the pre-training of a generic model. In addition to domain randomization, we propose two adaption methods fol- lowing the form of domain adaptation and few-shot learning. Domain adaptation [5], a subcategory of transfer learning [27], is used to reduce the domain shift between the source and target domain when the feature space is the same but the distributions are different. Inspired by adversarial domain adaptation [28], our approach learns a domain classifier and the image encoder learns domain-invariant features to con- fuse the classifier. We propose an object-level augmentation method to enrich the image dataset for adversarial training, increasing the generalization of the encoder to new domains. While there exist similar work, for example, Chen et al. [29] investigated domain adversarial training in their work, their approach focuses on updating the feature adaptor and the discriminator using unlabeled data, rather than updating the grasp synthesis model. In contrast, our grasping adaptation approach, consisting of unsupervised adversarial adaptation and supervised few-shot learning, jointly updates the grasping pipeline.   Few-shot learning [30] is the paradigm of learning from a small number of examples at test time. The key of metric- based few-shot learning method, one of the most popular categories, is to supervise the latent space and learn a versatile similarity function by metric loss [31], [32]. The supervised metric space supports fine-tuning using minimal adaptation data (also known as support set), and the similarity function generalizes to unknown test data [33], [34]. Motivated by the idea of few-shot learning methods, our approach first learns a joint metric space that encodes object attributes and then fine- tunes recognition and grasping of our model when testing on novel objects.   The attribute-based robotic grasping problem in this paper   is formulated as follows:   Definition 1. Given a query text for a target object, the goal for the robot is to grasp the corresponding object that is placed in the cluttered workspace.   To handle the natural language that is diverse and uncon- strained, we assume a language attribute parser, such as [35], and make the following assumption:   Assumption 1. The query text is parsed into the keywords of object attributes as an input to the robotic grasping model.   We consider color, shape, and category name attributes in this paper, while the proposed approach is extensible to other attributes (e.g., texture, pose, and functionality, etc.). In order to make object recognition tractable, we have the following assumption regarding object placement:   Assumption 2. The objects are stably placed within the workspace, and there is no stacking between objects.   While we show robotic grasping as a manipulation example in this paper, the proposed attribute-based learning methods should be, in principle, extensible to other robotic manipula- tion skills, such as suction, pushing, and placing.   Object attributes are semantically meaningful features and serve as an intermediate representation for object recognition and manipulation. In this section, we propose an end-to- end neural network for attribute-based robotic grasping. The proposed model takes as input an image of visual observation and a text of target description to predict pixel-wise instance grasping affordances. To acquire a rich dataset for training, we build a simulation environment that allows domain ran- domization with diverse objects. In simulation, the model is pre-trained to learn instance grasping and object attributes simultaneously.   We formulate attribute-based grasping as a mapping from pairs of workspace images and query text to target grasping affordances. The proposed visual-textual manipulation archi- tecture assumes no prior linguistic or perceptual knowledge. It consists of two modules, a multimodal encoder and an affordances decoder, as illustrated in Fig. 2.   Multimodal Encoder: As shown in Fig. 1a, our robot system uses an overhead RGB-D camera to capture the workspace. The RGB-D image is projected into a 3-D point cloud and then orthographically back-projected in the gravity direction to construct a heightmap image vpre of RGB and in the image as the depth channel. To specify an object grasping target, we give a text command t composed of color and/or shape attributes, e.g., “red cuboid”. The workspace image vpre and query text t are the input to visual spatial respectively. We use encoder ϕv,spa and text encoder ϕt the ImageNet-pretrained [36] ResNet-18 [37] backbone as   our image encoder ϕv,spa. We replace the first convolutional layer of the ResNet backbone with a 4-channel convolutional layer to match the RGB-D heightmap input. The encoder encodes the RGB and depth observation into 3D visual matrix φv,spa ∈ RH×W ×512. The text encoder ϕt is a deep averaging network [38] represented by three fully-connected layers and interleaved ReLU [39] activation functions. We first map each token in a sentence text to an embeddings vector of 128 dimension. The mean token embeddings (i.e., continuous bag- of-words [40] model) of the text are input to the 3-layer MLP text encoder to produce a text vector φt ∈ R512. The visual matrix φv,spa and the text vector φt are then fused by the gated- attention mechanism [41]: each element of φt is repeated and expanded to an H × W matrix to match the dimension of φv,spa. The expanded matrix is multiplied element-wise with φv,spa to produce a fusion matrix Fatt. The gated-attention unit is designed to gate certain pixels in the visual feature matrix matching to the text vector, resulting in the fusion matrix containing the visual features selected by the query text. By this means, we can detect different attributes of the objects in the image, such as color and shape.   which predicts pixel-wise scores of horizontal grasps within the rotated heightmaps. The pixel with the highest score among all the N maps determines the parameters (i.e., location and angle) for the grasping primitive to be executed. As in Fig. 2, our model predicts accurate target grasping location and valid (e.g., the selected angles for the red cuboid) target grasping angle.   The motion loss Lgrasp, which supervises the entire encoder-decoder networks, is the error from predictions of grasping affordances:    (qe − ¯qe)2 + λM   where Ns is the size of the dataset is collected in simulation, qe is the grasping score in Qg at the executed location, and ¯qe is the ground-truth label (see Sec. IV-C). The second term ensures lower grasping scores for the pixels in background mask M (obtained from the depth image) with weight λM [43], and qi is the grasping score of a background pixel.   Affordances Decoder: Grasping affordances decoder ϕg is a fully-convolutional residual network [37], [42] interleaved with spatial bilinear 4× upsampling and ended with the the fusion sigmoid function. The decoder takes as input matrix Fatt and outputs a unit-ranged map Qg with the same size and resolution as the input image vpre. Each value of a pixel qi ∈ Qg represents the predicted score of target grasping success when executing a top-down grasp at the corresponding 3D location with a parallel-jaw gripper oriented horizontally concerning the map Qg. The grasping primitive is parameterized by a 3-D location and an angle. To examine different grasping angles, we rotate the input Fatt by N = 6 (multiples of 30◦) orientations before feeding into the decoder,   To learn generic object attributes, we perform multimodal attributes learning, where visual or textual embedding vectors corresponding to similar attributes are encouraged to be closer in the latent space. Inspired by [13], we take advantage of the object persistence: the embedding difference of the scene be- fore and after grasping is enforced closer to the representation of the grasped object. During data collection, we record image- text data (vpre, vpost, t), where vpre and vpost are the workspace image before and after grasping respectively, and t is the query text that describes attributes of the grasped object.   We add one layer of global average pooling (GAP) [44], [45] at the end of the encoder ϕv,spa and denote the network   Algorithm 1 Online Data Collection Initialize bounded buffer B Notations: ϵ-greedy policy πϵ, our model ϕ, image v, text t, mask M , action a, and label ¯qe 1: while collecting data do 2: 3: 4: 5: 6:   reset the simulation and randomly drop basic objects get image vpre and randomly choose a command t execute action a ← πϵ(ϕ; vpre, t, ϵ) label ¯qe according to grasping results save vpre, t, M , a and ¯qe into B if successful grasp then   save vpost into B with HER   end if sample a batch from B to train the model   Lattr(T ) =   max ∥fi − f +   where α is a hyperparameter that controls the margin between positive and negative pairs. By encoding workspace images and query text into a joint metric space and supervising the embeddings through the equation of object persistence (as shown in Fig. 3), we learn generic attributes that are consistent across object categories, as discussed in Sec. VII-A.   C. Data Collection and Training   as visual vector encoder ϕv,vec. The output from ϕv,vec is a visual embedding vector that represents the average of scene features and has the same dimension of ϕt(t). We express the logic of the object persistence as an arithmetic constraint on visual and textual vectors such that (ϕv,vec(vpre)−ϕv,vec(vpost)) is close to ϕt(t). We use the triplet loss [46] to approximate the constraint, and the set of triplets T is defined as   i ) | s(afi, af +   ) > s(afi, af −   where fi, f + are random samples from the pool i of vectors (ϕv,vec(vpre) − ϕv,vec(vpost)) and ϕt(t), and af is an n-dimensional attribute label vector corresponding to the feature vector f (e.g., color, shape, and category name, etc.). Function s(·, ·) is an attribute similarity function that evaluates the similarity between two attribute label vectors:   1 = a i if a i otherwise   where a i denotes the i-th element of the label vector a, and the indicator function 1(·, ·) evaluates the element-wise similarity. Note that 0 indicates null attribute meaning no attribute is specified in the label. As an example, suppose we have the dictionary dict = {“eos” : 0, “red” : 1, “black” : 2, “yellow” : 3, “cylinder” : 4, “cube” : 5}; then, “red cylinder” can be represented as a label vector af0 = [1, 4], and “red cube” can be represented as af1 = [1, 5]. The similarity between the two label vectors is computed using (3) such that s(af0 , af1 ) = s([1, 4], [1, 5]) = 0.5. Additionally, when “red” and “black” are used without any additional attribute description, they are mapped to the vectors [1, 0] and [2, 0], respectively. In this case, the similarity between the two labels is derived as s([1, 0], [2, 0]) = 0. With the triplets of embedding vectors, multimodal metric loss Lattr is defined   To achieve self-supervision, we create a simulation envi- ronment in which objects are identified and grasped based on a description of semantic attributes. We collect training data in simulation with the following procedure, as summarized in Algorithm 1. Several objects are randomly dropped into the workspace in front of the robot. Given a workspace image and a query text, the robot learns to grasp a target under ϵ-greedy exploration [47] (ϵ = 0 during testing, i.e., an argmax policy). We save the workspace images, query text, background masks, executed actions, and results into a bounded buffer. The ground-truth labels are automatically generated for learning grasping affordances. The label ¯qe in (1) is assigned as the attribute similarity in (3) between the query text and the grasped object (0 if no object grasped). We also save the workspace image after a successful grasping   for learning object attributes. To deal with sparse rewards in target-driven grasping, the hindsight experience replay (HER) technique [48] is applied. If a non-target is grasped, we add the additional positive sample by relabeling the target text. Fig. 4 shows the basic objects of various colors (red, green, blue, yellow, and black) and shapes (cube, cuboid, cylinder, and sphere) used in our simulation. We choose these colors and shapes because they are foundational for common objects in daily life. To enrich the distribution of training data, we perturb color RGB values, randomize sizes and heights of the objects, and randomize textures of the workspace. Using the domain randomization techniques [24], we can generate a number of randomized properties in simulation and achieve a model with better generalization. At every iteration, we sample a batch from the buffer and run one off-policy training. The training loss is defined as   by combining both motion loss Lgrasp (1) and metric loss Lattr (5). We train the proposed model using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 10−4, momentumn of 0.9, and weight decay of 2 × 10−5 for 5k iterations. Each training iteration involves capturing data, computing a forward pass, executing an action, and backpropagating. After collecting a dataset of 5k samples, we replay the entire data for 100 epochs.   Due to the high cost of collecting data on real robots, we often choose to train robotic models in a simulator. However, the domain gap between the source domain (e.g., simulation, trained objects) and the target domain (e.g., the real world, novel objects) frequently leads to the failure of the learned models. We propose to, in addition to randomizing the source domain in Sec. IV-C, adapt our learned model using data from the target domain to further alleviate the domain shifts. One typical adaptation approach is fine-tuning the pre-trained model. However, the fine-tuning methods remain expensive in terms of data usage. In this section, as shown in Fig. 6, we propose two data-efficient adaptation methods: 1) adversarial adaptation, which adapts the image encoder using unlabeled images, and 2) one-grasp adaptation, which updates the end- to-end model using one grasp trial. The two adaptation meth-   ods can be either used independently or in combination for performance improvement.   Despite that our generic model trained using the simulated basic objects shows good generalization (see Sec. VII-B), the visual feature shifts (e.g., objects, lighting conditions, and scene configurations, etc.) are inevitable. As a result, the image encoder is likely to produce out-of-distribution visual embeddings, leading to the failure of the grasping model. To reduce the influence of the domain shifts, we propose to use adversarial adaptation [28] to learn domain-invariant visual features that are transferable across different domains. In our problem setup, the simulated basic objects constitute the source domain, and our goal is to transfer the learned model to a target domain that is prone to domain shifts.   As shown in Fig. 6a, adversarial adaptation regularizes the weights of the image encoder ϕv by enforcing a two- player game similar to the generative adversarial network (GAN) [49]. A domain classifier (i.e., discriminator) learns to distinguish between two domains, while the image encoder learns to fool the domain classifier by learning domain- invariant features. To achieve adversarial training, we connect the encoder and the discriminator via a gradient reversal layer (GRL) [50] that has reverse forward and back-propagation schemes. The GRL R is an identity mapping during forward- propagation but reverses the sign of the gradients during back- propagation:   R(x) = x dR dx   where I is an identity matrix, and λr is a positive constant.   During adaptation, images from the two different domains are fed into the image encoder. The domain classifier fd takes as input the encoded features, and is trained to predict which domain the feature is from, by maximizing the binary cross-entropy Hd. Using the source domain dataset Ds = {vs , ts , ys }Ns ({image, text, label} collected in Algorithm 1) and assuming a target domain dataset Dt = {vt }Nt , the model is updated to be optimal on the training loss Ltrain (6) under the regularization of the adversarial loss Ladv   Hd(fd(R(ϕv,vec(vi))), di)   Ladvadp = Ltrain(vs , ts , ys ) + Ladv(vt )   where Ladvadp is the overall loss for adversarial adaptation, di ∈ {0, 1} are the binary domain label for each input vi. Note that the reversal layer R is augmented between the classifier fd and the encoder ϕv,vec and updates them in reversal directions. The target dataset Dt for the new domain is the prerequisite to performing adversarial adaptation. As shown in Fig. 7, we propose a object-level augmentation (ObjectAug) approach instead of collecting data from a vast number of configurations. Since the grasping label is not required in Dt , synthetic gen- eration of a large image dataset would be more efficient. We begin by collecting RGB-D images of all conceivable objects in the target domain. Using the object mask acquired from the depth channel, we extract each object individually and randomize them with the single-object augmentation methods commonly used (e.g., scaling, flipping, and rotation). To generate an augmented RGB-D image, the augmented objects are randomly sampled and shifted before being overlaid with a background image. We also perform IoU threshold verification to avoid dense overlapping. To simulate varying conditions of target domains, we can apply the visual jitter technique discussed in Sec. VI-A to obtain more diverse data. Given the ease with which unlabeled images may be acquired (e.g., the internet, image collection), generating a target dataset that is of the same magnitude as the source dataset is rather efficient.   image encoder and leave the text encoder and the grasping affordance decoder unadapted. When deploying in a new domain, end-to-end model fine-tuning is often necessary, but this comes at the cost of a large dataset covering all potential testing object configurations. To further adapt to novel objects and new scenes in a data-efficient manner, we present a one- grasp adaptation scheme (see Fig. 6b) that only requires one successful grasp of a novel object. The inductive bias of object attributes in Sec. IV-B is the key to adaptation in this limited-data regime. If similar objects are enforced closer in the embedding space, the adaptation distance for a novel object is likely to be shorter [51].   The proposed one-grasp adaptation method improves the model performance on a novel target object at the cost of only one grasp. The adaptation data is collected with the following one-grasp data augmentation (OneGraspAug) procedure. We place the object solely in the workspace and run the generic model to collect one successful grasp. The setting of a sole object facilitates grasping and avoids combinatorial object arrangements. Because convolutional neural networks are not rotation-invariant by design, we also augment the grasp data by rotating with various orientations to achieve rotation- invariance [52], [53], i.e., the ability to recognize and grasp an object regardless of its orientation. As shown in Fig. 8, we rotate the collected image and action execution to have rotated versions of the collected data.   In the adaptation stage, we add the category name of the object as an additional token to the query text, e.g., “apple, red sphere” for the testing object apple. The token embedding of the object name is initialized properly to keep the embedding vector of the query text unchanged. The addition of the object name allows for a more specific grasping instruction and distinguishing from similar objects via adaptation. By optimizing over motion loss Lgrasp in (1), we jointly fine- tune the recognition and grasping of our model for unknown objects and scenes. As delineated in Sec. VII-C, the adapted model outputs higher affordances on the target objects that are not seen and grasped before.   By learning domain-invariant features, the adversarial adap- tation technique in Sec. V-A improves model generalization using unlabeled images of the target domain. However, the adversarial loss uses unlabeled images to only update the   We use CoppeliaSim [54] to build our simulation environ- ment. The simulation setup includes a UR5 robot arm and   an RG2 gripper, with Bullet Physics 2.83 for dynamics and CoppeliaSim’s internal inverse kinematics module for robot motion planning. We simulate a statically mounted overhead 3D camera in the environment from which perception data is captured. The camera renders RGB-D images with a 640×480 pixels resolution using OpenGL. We use various basic and novel objects for training and testing in the simulation. As shown in Fig. 4, the basic objects consist of 36 different 3D toy blocks, whose shapes and colors are randomly chosen during experiments. We collect 34 different 3D household objects from the YCB dataset [55] or the 3D mesh library SketchUp [56], as shown in Fig. 5a. To produce more diverse simulation configurations, the simulation environment supports several domain randomization techniques, including background ran- domization, color jitter (i.e., randomly changing the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the color channel), and depth jitter (i.e., adding Gaussian noise to the depth channel).   Fig. 1a shows our real-world setup that includes a Franka Emika Panda robot arm with a FESTO DHAS soft gripper and a hand-mounted Intel RealSense D415 camera overlooking a tabletop scene. We use the soft fingers because they are more suitable for grasping the objects in our experiments and are similarly compliant to the RG2 fingers. For perception data, RGB-D images of resolution 640 × 480 are captured from the RGB-D camera, statically mounted on the robot arm. The camera is localized with respect to the robot base using the automatic calibration procedure of ViSP [57], during which the camera tracks the location of a checkerboard pattern taped on the table. For a given pose, the robot follows the corresponding trajectory generated with MoveIt [58] in open-loop. The entire system is implemented under the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework and runs on a PC workstation with an Intel i7-8700 CPU and an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU. Objects vary throughout tests, with a collection of 20+ different household objects being used to test model generalization to novel objects, as shown in Fig. 5b.   We propose training with simulated basic objects first to have a generic model and then adapting it to novel objects and real-world scenes. In the experiments, we first analyze the structured metric space of our generic model and show the consistency between attention and grasping maps. Next, we evaluate the instance grasping performance of the generic model and show its modest generalization even before adapta- tion. Then, we adapt the model using the proposed adversarial and one-grasp adaptation methods and test the grasping models after adaptation. Finally, we run a series of ablation studies to investigate the two adaptation methods. The goals of the experiments are four-fold:   1) to show the effectiveness of multimodal attribute learning   for instance robotic grasping,   2) to evaluate our attribute-based grasping system in both   simulated and real-world settings,   3) to evaluate the proposed adversarial and one-grasp adap-   tation methods, and   4) to show the importance of the proposed data augmenta-   tion methods for grasping adaptation.   By embedding workspace images and query text into a joint metric space, the multimodal encoder (ϕv and ϕt), supervised by metric loss Lattr and motion loss Lgrasp, learns attending to text-correlated visual features. We visualize what our model “sees” by computing the dot product of text vector φt with each pixel of the visual matrix φv,spa. This computation obtains an attention heatmap over the image, which refers to the similarity between the query text and each pixel’s receptive field (see Fig. 9a). We quantitate the attention of our model and report its attention localization performance in Table I (see Ours-Attention). Evaluation metrics: An attention local- ization is considered correct only if the maximum value in the attention heatmap lies on the target object.   Ours-Attention (in Table I) performs target localization at a 74.5% accuracy on simulated novel objects and a 70.2% accuracy on real-world objects, without any localization su- pervision provided. In summary, our multimodal embeddings demonstrate a consistent pattern across object categories and scenes. Though the localization results are not directly used for grasping, the consistent embeddings facilitate learning, generalization, and adaptation of our grasping model, as shown in Fig. 9 and discussed in the following subsections.   We compare the instance grasping performance of our   generic model with the following baselines:   1) Indiscriminate is an indiscriminate grasping version of our approach and composed of a visual spatial encoder ϕv,spa and a grasping affordances decoder ϕg. We collect a dataset of binary indiscriminate grasping labels and train Indiscriminate using Lgrasp in (1).   2) ClassIndis extends Indiscriminate with an attributes clas- sifier that is trained to predict color and shape attributes   on cropped object images. We filter the grasping maps from Indiscriminate using the mask of a target recognized by the classifier.   3) EncoderIndis is similar to [21] and is another extension of Indiscriminate, which leverages a multimodal encoder (ϕv,vec and ϕt in Sec. IV-A) for text template matching. The encoder is trained using Lattr in (5) to evaluate the similarity between each cropped object image and query text. During training, we also include attributes classification as an axillary task.   4) AttrID is for an ablation study of our text encoder ϕt. The only difference between AttrID and the proposed method is that AttrID takes the attribute shape and color ID one- hot encoding as the system input, but our generic model uses Word2Vec continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model to convert the texts into vector inputs. During training, we use both the motion loss and the metric loss to update the model.   5) NoMetric is for an ablation study of multimodal metric loss. We simply remove the metric loss on the basis of our approach during its training.   Evaluation metrics: These methods have different target recognition schemes: ClassIndis and EncoderIndis recognize a target by classification and text template matching respec- tively; NoMetric, AttrID and Ours are end-to-end. We report their target recognition performance (in addition to instance grasping performance, as in the next paragraph). A target localization is correct only if the predicted grasping location lies on the target object. The instance grasping success rate is defined as # of successful grasps on correct target . In each testing scene, # of total grasps we only execute grasping once.   We evaluate the methods on both simulated basic (sim basic) and simulated novel (sim novel) objects in simulation, where there are 1200 test cases for the basic objects (Fig. 4) and 3400 test cases for the 34 novel objects (Fig. 5a, mostly from the YCB dataset [55]). We assume the objects are placed right- side up to be stable while their 4D pose (3D position and a yaw angle) can vary arbitrarily. For each testing object, we pre-choose a query text that best describes its color and/or shape. In each test case, four objects are randomly sampled and placed in the workspace, except avoiding any two objects with the same attributes. The robot is required to grasp the target   queried by an attribute text. We report the results of target recognition in Table I and the results of instance grasping in Table II.   Overall, our approach outperforms the baselines remarkably (in both recognition and grasping) and achieves a 98.4% grasping success rate on the simulated basic objects and an 72.1% grasping success rate on the simulated novel objects. ClassIndis extends Indiscriminate that is well trained in target- agnostic tasks and performs well on the basic objects, but the attributes classifier generalizes poorly. EncoderIndis utilizes a more generalizable recognition module and performs better on the novel objects. However, EncoderIndis fails to reach opti- mality because its separately-trained recognition and grasping modules have different training objectives from instance grasp- ing. Despite training the recognition and grasping modules simultaneously, AttrID using sparse attribute one-hot IDs as a substitute for text inputs yields lower recognition accuracy and grasping success rate compared to Ours. As an ablation study, the performance gap between NoMetric and Ours shows the effectiveness of multimodal metric loss, which supervises the joint latent space to produce consistent embeddings, as discussed in Sec. VII-A. Our approach successfully learns object attributes that generalize well to novel objects, as shown in Fig. 9.   We further evaluate our approach and the baselines on the real robot before any adaptation (see Table I and II). Fig. 5b shows 21 testing objects of various colors and shapes used in our real-robot experiments. The robot is tasked to grasp the target within a combination of 6 objects placed on the table. We use the same 21 object combinations that are randomly generated and repeat each combination twice, resulting in a total of 252 grasping trials for each method. Overall, the grasping performance of all the methods decreases due to the domain gap. However, our approach shows the best generalization and achieves a 63.1% grasping success rate, before adaptation, in the real-world scenes.   The generic model in Sec. VII-B infers the object closest to the query text as the target. Overall, our generic model demonstrates good generalization despite the gaps in the testing scenes. Specifically, these gaps are 1) RGB values of the testing objects deviate from training ranges, 2) some testing objects are multi-colored, 3) shape and size differences between the testing objects and the training objects, and 4) depth noises in the real world causing imperfect object shapes. To account for the gaps, we further adapt our generic model to increase instance recognition and grasping performance.   We first collect one successful grasp of a solely placed target object and then augment the collected data by rotating with additional N − 1 angles, as discussed in Sec. V-B and shown in Fig. 8. The compared methods that are adapted with the same adaptation data are as follows:   recognition accuracy on the adaptation data.   2) EncoderIndis minimizes the latent distance between cropped target images and query text to improve text template matching.   3) NoMetric takes as input images and text, and minimizes   motion loss on the adaptation data.   4) One-Grasp is our prior work [1] which updates the   encoder-decoder in an end-to-end manner.   5) AttrID-One-Grasp uses the same adaptation method and data as One-Grasp baseline on AttrID from Sec. VII-B. We also update Indiscriminative grasping in ClassIndis and EncoderIndis. We keep the experimental setup the same with Sec. VII-B and evaluate the instance grasping performance of the adapted models. We report the adapted instance grasping success rate in Table III and the adaptation gains in Fig. 10. The attributes classifier in ClassIndis suffers from insufficient adaptation data, limiting its target recognition and adaptation performance. While EncoderIndis minimizes embedding dis- tances in its latent space and shows better performance, it is still worse than One-Grasp. By fine-tuning over the structured metric space, One-Grasp updates the end-to-end model and improves target recognition and grasping jointly. At the cost of minimal data collection, One-Grasp achieves an 83.7% grasp- ing success rate on the simulated novel objects and an 76.6% grasping success rate on the real objects, which shows the significant adaptation gains. On the contrary, the unstructured latent space in NoMetric limits its adaptation, demonstrating the importance of attributes learning for grasping affordances learning. The difference in adaptation performance between NoMetric and One-Grasp demonstrates the significance of the regulated feature space in adaptation. Furthermore, the substantial adaptation gain observed in AttrID validates the applicability of our adaptation method with sparse feature inputs.   As an improvement, we propose applying Adversarial adap- tation on the image encoder to learn domain-invariant features before One-Grasp adaptation. The image encoder’s domain invariancy results in superior transferring performance for Adversarial+One-Grasp: an instance grasping success rate of 86.0% in the domain of sim novel and 81.7% in the domain of real-world novel (real novel). The qualitative results in Fig. 11 suggest the efficacy of the two adaptation methods: 1) both Adversarial adaptation and One-Grasp adaptation increase the   recognition and grasping performance of the models, and 2) Adversarial adaptation minimizes grasping noises around non- target objects (by reducing domain feature changes), while One-Grasp adaptation can rectify recognition and grasping errors through end-to-end updates. The more compact and centered contour in Fig. 11b could be explained by the hypothesis that domain-invariant features improve the output consistency of the encoder across domains. The corrected target recognition in Fig. 11c, on the other hand, is attributed to the One-Grasp adaptation which effectively shifts the af- fordances from irrelevant objects to the target object through the end-to-end model updates. Another noteworthy finding is that the combined adaptation Adversarial+One-Grasp appears to benefit from both Adversarial adaptation and One-Grasp adaptation, as their focuses are complementary.   D. Comparison with a Foundation Model   In addition to the instance grasping experiments, we per- form another quantitative evaluation of the adapted model on sim novel objects. For comparison, we utilize the CLIP model [59], a recently prevailing multimodal (text and image) foundation model. CLIP aligns language and image features through training with millions of text-image pairs and is widely acclaimed for its robust generalization capability across   The proposed adaptation approaches efficiently improve the instance grasping performance of our model. As discussed in Sec. VII-C, the finding that the approaches have complemen- tary adaptation focuses leads to one of the major features: the two adaptation methods can be employed individually or in combination, depending on the availability of adaptation data. To investigate their independent and combinative performance, we conduct an ablation study to compare the grasping models as follows:   1) Generic is the baseline generic model obtained in Sec.   VII-B before any adaptation.   2) Adversarial adapts the generic model to learn domain- invariant features using a large augmented data, as dis- cussed in Sec. V-A.   3) One-Grasp adapts the generic model using one grasping   trial of the target object, as discussed in Sec. V-B.   4) Adversarial+One-Grasp applies the two adaptation ap- proaches on the generic model sequentially to improve the recognition and grasping.   As shown in Fig. 14, the adaptation methods are compared in four testing environments with an increasing extent of domain shifts: 1) sim basic jitter—simulated basic objects with visual jitter (see Sec. VI-A) applied on color and depth channels as well as background, 2) sim novel—simulated novel objects, 3) sim novel jitter—simulated novel objects with visual jitter, and 4) real novel—real novel objects. As the training environment uses simulated basic objects, the testing environments include the domain shifts caused by novel objects, visual jitter, and real-world noises.   We report the experimental results of the instance grasp- ing success rate in Fig. 13. Overall, all adaptation methods improve the grasping performance across the testing envi- ronments. It is not surprising that adaptation is likely to be more effective (i.e., leading to more performance increments) if the domain shifts are severer. For example, the adaptation gain in the environment of sim basic jitter is less than 4%, while the real environment witnesses an adaptation gain of over 18%. Moreover, when encountering complex novel objects that are more challenging (e.g., drill) than the basic the One-Grasp method training objects (e.g., red cuboid), provides more adaptation power than the Adversarial method. In Adversarial adaptation, we use unlabeled data from the target domain to update the image encoder, while the text encoder and grasping decoder remain unadapted. As a result, the Adversarial adapted model is more prone to encountering difficulties with challenging novel objects (e.g., drill and spatula). On the other hand, One-Grasp adaptation adapts the entire model and demonstrates better performance on these challenging objects, but it requires additional labeled data (at least one grasp) of the objects. Another observa- tion is that we can combine the two adaptation methods to achieve an even higher adaptation performance. Through various tests, the combined method Adversarial+One-Grasp adaptation consistently shows the best performance in all the testing environments. This suggests that the two adaptation methods adapt our model complementarily for accumulative   various objects. To evaluate the performance of CLIP, we segment and crop randomly placed objects in the workspace. For each object crop and its attribute text description, the CLIP model calculates a matching score, which is then used to construct the confusion matrix shown in Fig. 12a. The pairwise matching scores reflect the similarity between the object crops and the text inputs. As for our Adversarial+One- Grasp model, we compute another confusion matrix shown in Fig. 12b by collecting the highest affordance value, under each target attribute description, from affordance maps Qg within each object’s segmentation mask. While CLIP matching uses cropped images of single objects, Adversarial+One-Grasp is tested using workspace images of multiple objects, which is a more natural but also more challenging setting. Fig. 12 shows that Adversarial+One-Grasp achieves more accurate ground- ing of the correct target objects. In contrast, the matching scores produced by the CLIP model often lack discrimination, leading to some misclassifications (e.g., “sphere soccer” and “yellow cylinder yellowcup”). This comparison highlights the limitations of zero-shot generalization in a foundation model and showcases the effectiveness of our adaptation method.   adaptation gains. In practice, we can choose a configuration of adaptation methods based on the availability of the adaptation data.   F. Data Augmentation for Adaptation   The quality of adaptation data is critical for grasping adap- tation. The two data augmentation methods, ObjectAug and OneGraspAug, are proposed for the two adaptation methods respectively. We execute the ablation studies in Table IV and Table V to examine the augmentation methods. The results of adapted instance grasping are presented in the tables. In the ablations for object-level augmentation, the compared approaches are   1) Objects uses the raw data (images of single objects) as   the adaptation data.   2) ObjectOverlay overlays the randomly sampled objects on the background image to synthesize a large dataset covering possible object combinations and locations. 3) ObjectAug is our object-level data augmetation method discussed in Sec. V-A, where much richer object config-   urations (i.e., orientations and scales) are covered in the synthesized dataset.   For the above augmentation methods, we keep the dataset size constant and use each augmentation data in (9), accordingly. Even though the data is unlabeled, the adaptation data quality has a direct impact on grasping performance, as seen in Table IV. The performance difference between Objects and ObjectAug, for example, is up to 4% on real novel objects, they nominally contain the identical despite the fact objects. This finding demonstrates that the suggested object- level data augmentation successfully reduces domain shift by supplying rich unlabeled data.   In the ablations for one-grasp augmentation, the comparable   approaches include   1) OneGrasp uses the raw data of one successful grasp trial, including an RGB-D image and the corresponding grasping action.   2) OneGraspRpt simply repeats the one-grasp data N times without rotating the data, where N = 6 is the angle discretion parameter.   3) OneGraspAug is our one-grasp data augmetation method discussed in Sec. V-B, where we augment the one-grasp data by rotating for N orientations to enrich possible orientations of objects and robot grasping.   As shown in Table V, OneGraspAug outperforms the com- pared methods by over 4% grasping success rate on real robot experiments, which demonstrates how angle-augmented data can be used to make the grasping model rotation-invariant for object recognition and grasping.   In this work, we presented a novel attribute-based robotic grasping system. An end-to-end architecture was proposed to learn object attributes and manipulation jointly. Workspace images and query text were encoded into a joint metric space, which was further supervised by object persistence before and after grasping. Our model was self-supervised in a simulation only using basic objects but showed good generalization. To further adapt to novel objects and real-world scenes, we proposed two data-efficient adaptation methods, adversarial adaptation and one-grasp adaptation, which only require un- labeled object images or one grasp trial. Our grasping system achieved an 86.0% instance grasping success rate in simulation   and an 81.7% instance grasping success rate in the real world, both on unknown objects. Our approach outperformed the other compared methods by large margins.   We showed that incorporating object attributes in robotic grasping improves the performance of the deep learning grasp- ing model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore object attributes for the generalization and adaptation of deep learning robotic grasping models. Our long- term goal is to further improve the effectiveness and robustness of our model by pre-training it with objects of richer attributes. Another possible avenue for future work is to study object attributes under partial observation, such as the shape of an object in dense clutter. It would be of interest to explore how to achieve more robust attribute perception, potentially using shape completion algorithms.",

In today’s information-\nsaturated environment, users must decide what to process, filter,\nand prioritize. Although using visualizations to address this chal-\nlenge has been widely discussed [Perkhofer et al. 2016], InfoVis\nsystems have yet to fully realize their potential in aiding critical\ndecision-making. The effectiveness of InfoVis in responding to criti-\ncal events hinges on the visual representation of data and the speed\nat which actionable insights can be derived. We argue that phys-\niological computing holds significant promise for innovation in\nInfoVis by incorporating human body signals, which can lead to\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nmore precise user interface adaptations through closed-loop im-\nplicit monitoring [Fairclough 2022]. This is supported by evidence\nthat cognitive processes are affected by user interface aesthetics,\ndetectable through physiological signals [Haddad et al. 2024; Hirsh-\nfield et al. 2011; Lukanov et al. 2016; Peck et al. 2013]. Specifically,\nvisual attention allocation in graphic design reflects the perceived\nimportance of design elements [Cartella et al. 2024]. Understanding\nhow users allocate their attention presents a research opportu-\nnity [Emami et al. 2024].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the context of visual attention, we can differentiate between\nbottom-up saliency, which arises from low-level visual features like\ncolor, contrast, and motion, capturing attention automatically. In\ncontrast, top-down saliency is shaped by prior knowledge, tasks,\nand goals, guiding attention based on relevance [Wang et al. 2024a].\nWhile bottom-up saliency is driven by stimuli, top-down saliency\nis cognitive and context-dependent [Wang et al. 2024a]. InfoVis\nmainly involves top-down processing as users engage with visual\nrepresentations [Wang et al. 2024a].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo model visual attention, Eye-tracking (ET) is typically used.\nHowever, collecting organic data presents significant challenges,\nincluding the reliance on proprietary, high-precision equipment\nand data privacy concerns [Khurana et al. 2023]. Recent studies\nhave addressed the limitations of ET technology by introducing\ncomputational attention models, a promising alternative to predict\ngaze patterns in response to specific stimuli [Deng et al. 2023]. In\nthe field of Computer Vision (CV), predictive models of human\nattention have demonstrated their utility across various applica-\ntions, including the optimization of interaction designs and the\nenhancement of webpage layouts [Li et al. 2024]. To train and eval-\nuate these models, scientific datasets containing fixation points\ngenerated by human observers exploring images on specific tasks\nhave been developed. These datasets are typically captured using\neye-trackers, webcams [Assens et al. 2018] and mouse clicks with\ntechniques like BubbleView [Kim et al. 2017]. Popular examples are\nMASSVIS [Borkin et al. 2016], and UEyes dataset [Jiang et al. 2023a]\nfor InfoVis and SALICON [Jiang et al. 2015] and CAT2000 [Borji\nand Itti 2015] for natural images.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTypically, existing solutions predict either visual attention [Ay-\ndemir et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023; Fosco et al. 2020a], also referred\nto as saliency modeling, or scanpaths, which is also regarded as\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nanother form of saliency prediction that accounts for the temporal\ndimension [Kümmerer et al. 2022; Martin et al. 2022; Sui et al. 2023;\nWang et al. 2024a]. Saliency prediction aims to generate heatmaps\nor probability distributions that emphasize areas of attention within\nan image [Cartella et al. 2024]. Contemporary approaches utilize\ndeep neural networks to automatically learn discriminative fea-\ntures, as evidenced by models such as those proposed by Chen et al.\n[2023] and Aydemir et al. [2023]. Aydemir et al. [2023].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHowever, collapsing attention prediction to saliency maps re-\nsults in the loss of temporal information of attentional deploy-\nment [Cartella et al. 2024]. Two scanpaths that cover similar areas\nof an image, but follow entirely different sequences, can yield identi-\ncal saliency maps. Nevertheless, the order in which a visual stimulus\nis explored is important, as it more accurately reflects the promi-\nnence of the image elements in relation to the observer [Cartella\net al. 2024]. This has driven research into the complementary task of\nscanpath prediction—the task of forecasting a sequence of fixations\nover a visual stimulus. Certain models for predicting scanpaths\nin images have been proposed, with recent efforts placing more\nemphasis on deep learning solutions (e.g., TPP-Gaze [D’Amelio\net al. 2024]). While most models are based on free-viewing human\nscanpaths, the former ones emerge for InfoVis [Wang et al. 2024a].\nSpecific models are needed since InfoVis stimuli are fundamentally\ndifferent from natural images: they typically include more text and\nlarger areas with uniform color and minimal to no texture [Matzen\net al. 2018; Wang et al. 2024a].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nBy modeling eye movement patterns based on visual saliency,\nwe can gain insights into user perception and interaction, reduc-\ning the need to involve users early in the design process [Emami\net al. 2024; Shi et al. 2025]. These predictions enable us to measure\nthe impact of visual changes in InfoVis, optimize design compo-\nnents for specific attention levels, and evaluate user awareness of\nelements over time [Emami et al. 2024]. Such solutions could be\nused as an evaluation tool, which visualization designers can use\nto compare candidate designs in either a qualitative or quantitative\nmanner [Matzen et al. 2018]. Modelling scanpaths on InfoVis can\noffer insights into the rich spatial and temporal dynamics of human\nattention [Wang et al. 2024a].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn this paper, we conducted a ET study with 40 participants who\nanalysed graphs of different numbers of nodes, while answering\nquestions of varying complexity in the context of digital forensics.\nWe investigated how similar these gaze patterns are to synthetic\nscanpaths produced by various generative models: DeepGaze [Küm-\nmerer et al. 2022], UMSS [Wang et al. 2024a] and Gazeformer [Mon-\ndal et al. 2023]. Our objective is to determine which state-of-the-art\ngenerative model can most effectively synthesise realistic scanpaths\non graph-based visualizations and how the question and visualisa-\ntion complexity impacts their accuracy.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n2 Related work\nEye-tracking is extensively used in InfoVis as it offers valuable\ninsights into information foraging and decision-making processes,\nthereby informing research on visual attention [Borkin et al.\n2016] [Nguyen et al. 2017].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nConsidering the different conditions in visual analysis tasks, Po-\nlatsek et al. [2018] explored how visual attention and perception\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ninfluence task-based analysis. By examining the MASSVIS dataset,\ntheir study demonstrated that free-viewing saliency models fall\nshort in capturing the nuances of task-driven attention, suggesting\nthat these models require further refinement. Following that, Wang\net al. [2024b] created the SalChartQA dataset, a human-annotated\nChart Question Answering dataset covering three visualization\ntypes: bar plots, line plots, and pie charts. Analyses on SalChartQA\ndemonstrate the strong impact of the question on visual saliency.\nHowever, this study does not analyze graph-based visualizations\nand collects data using BubbleView [Kim et al. 2017].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nEarly research on scanpath prediction has primarily utilized\nbottom-up saliency maps to predict gaze shifts and positions. No-\ntable models, such as SalTiNet [Assens et al. 2017], introduced\na deep learning framework that innovatively represents saliency\nmaps in three dimensions, termed saliency volumes. This structure\ncaptures the temporal aspect of fixations by adding a temporal axis\nto traditional saliency maps. Scanpaths are generated by sampling\nfixation points from these saliency volumes, followed by a post-\nfiltering stage. PathGAN [Assens et al. 2018] advanced this by offer-\ning a fully end-to-end solution, employing a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) to directly produce scanpaths without the need for\nsampling or post-processing. DeepGaze III [Kümmerer et al. 2022]\nimproved prediction using saliency maps and previous scanpaths\nto forecast subsequent fixations, establishing itself as the state-of-\nthe-art for generating free-viewing human scanpaths. Later, Jiang\net al. [2023b] introduced DeepGaze++ based on DeepGaze III with\nmodifications and fine-tuned it on the UEyes dataset. Emami et al.\n[2024] optimized the parameters of DeepGaze++, such as masking\nradius, IOR mechanisms and input image size for user interfaces,\nrelevant to InfoVis. So we consider this version of DeepGaze++\nas the state-of-the-art model for scanpath prediction with these\nparameters.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in visual attention\nmodels for InfoVis, as demonstrated by Matzen et al. [2018] who ex-\namined the limitations of existing saliency models on the MASSVIS\ndataset. Their findings motivated the development of the Data Visu-\nalization Saliency (DVS) model to better address these shortcomings.\nHowever, scanpath prediction remains underexplored, with UMSS\n[Wang et al. 2024a] emerging as the first notable contribution and\nserving as the state-of-the-art model in this area. Moreover, current\nmethods typically generate visual attention maps without consid-\nering user questions or queries [Shi et al. 2025]. The investigation\nof goal-directed attention—such as that required for visual search\ntasks—remains in its early stages [Cartella et al. 2024]. In InfoVis,\nresearch on question-driven saliency and scanpath prediction is\nespecially recent.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFor saliency, VisSalFormer [Wang et al. 2024b] remains the only\nmethod available for predicting question-driven saliency on infor-\nmation visualizations. In terms of scanpaths, Chartist [Shi et al.\n2025] is the only available model; it simulates how users move their\neyes to forage information on a chart—handling tasks such as value\nretrieval, filtering, and identifying extremes. Although Chartist was\ndeveloped around the same time as this work, its code was not\navailable, so a direct comparison was ommitted from our study.\nMoreover, since it is trained in a controlled environment rather\nthan using human eye-tracking data, it opens a promising direction\nfor future research.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn the context of visual question answering, models like Chen et\nal. [Chen et al. 2021a] combine visual-question-answering frame-\nworks with a ConvLSTM module to predict fixation position distri-\nbutions and durations based on questions related to natural images.\nRecently, Gazeformer [Mondal et al. 2023] proposed using a Trans-\nformer model to regress fixation coordinates within a scanpath\nfocused on object searching, conditioned on the embedding of the\nobject’s name from a pre-trained language model. For all these\nreasons, we considered Gazeformer to be the state-of-the-art model\nfor scanpath prediction in goal-directed attention.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAlthough these models are useful, they often depend on task-\nspecific configurations that limit their generalizability. UniAR [Li\net al. 2024] overcomes this by predicting scanpaths and saliency\nwhile also incorporating user input preferences across tasks. While\npromising, its closed-source nature prevented us from including it\nin our work.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3 Methodology\nThis section describes the methodology employed in this study,\ndetailing the data collection process, the generative models used,\nand the evaluation metrics. The Data Collection subsection outlines\nparticipant recruitment Section 3.1.1, the stimuli used Section 3.1.2,\ntask procedureSection 3.1.3, and the experimental apparatus Sec-\ntion 3.1.4. The Generative Models subsection introduces the models\napplied in the study Section 3.2 followed by a description of the\nmetrics used for evaluation Section 3.3.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3.1 Data Collection\nThe data was collected with the purpose of exploring the impact\nof different InfoVis adaptations in the context of digital forensics.\nHowever, the focus of this work is to investigate the impact of\nquestion complexity and number of nodes, and not the nature of\nthe adaptation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3.1.1 Participants. We recruited 40 participants with a mean age\nof 27.2 years (SD=4.9) through mailing lists and university portal\nadvertisements. Inclusion criteria required participants to be aged\n18 to 65 years, have no history of neurological disorders and have\nnormal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants also needed to\nunderstand and follow the experiment instructions and provide\nwritten informed consent before participating.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nStimuli. We consider undirected graphs, to convey infor-\n3.1.2\nmation about criminal records, such as numbers of arrests or in-\ncarceration states. This is the most common visualization type in\nthis domain [Bohm et al. 2021; Osborne and Slay 2011]. In this\nenvironment, nodes represent people, while the edges indicate\ntheir relationships. We followed a within-subjects design, where\nall participants were exposed to all experimental conditions but in\nrandomized order.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe consider two levels of visual complexity: graphs with three (3)\nor six (6) nodes. Each graph was presented as one of three different\nconfigurations:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nBaseline: Graphs without any visual adaptation (see example\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nin Figure 1a).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nPartial adaptation: Graphs with only one visual adaptation\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\ntaneously (see example in Figure 1g).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe consider five possible visual adaptations, based on principles\nof effective information visualization [Gelman and Unwin 2013;\nKnoblich et al. 2024; Shen et al. 2021] and popular guidelines,1\nwhere for example color is used for categorization and size is used\nto convey quantitative information:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nEdge color: Indicates whether individuals share matching\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nbirthplaces (Figure 1b).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nEdge thickness: Represents the strength of the connection\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\nbetween individuals (Figure 1c).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nNode size: Represents the number of arrests made by an in-\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\ndividual (Figure 1d).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nNode shape: Distinguishes whether the person is currently\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nin jail (Figure 1e).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nNode color: Indicates the gender of the individual (Figure 1f).\nWe prepared a set of questions to assess the participants’ ability\nto interpret the graphs under varying levels of complexity. The ques-\ntions designed to be answered based on the information conveyed\nin the graph and were categorized according to their difficulty:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nEasy questions: These involved simple queries that required\na straightforward interpretation of the graph (e.g., How\nmany people are in jail?).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nHard questions: These required a more in-depth analysis\nand a higher level of cognitive processing (e.g., How many\npeople with the same birthplace are connected to people\nwith more than two arrests?).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nOur independent variables are the numbers of nodes (three and\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nsix) and question difficulty (two factors: easy and hard).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n3.1.3 Task and Procedure.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nParticipants completed 15 practice trials to familiarize them-\nselves with the task. The experiment was conducted in a dimly\nlit room to minimize distractions and optimize eye-tracking data\nquality. The main experiment consisted of 120 trials per participant\n(30 for each of our analysed categories). Each trial began with a\n1-second fixation cross, followed by a self-paced question-reading\nphase (Figure 2). Participants then viewed a graph and had 10\nseconds to respond before the system advanced to the next trial au-\ntomatically. Participants provided single-digit responses as quickly\nand accurately as possible or pressed ‘n’ if they could not answer.\nA self-paced resting period followed each trial before proceeding.\nThis cycle repeated for 120 trials, with the experiment lasting about\n30 minutes and all trials randomized.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n3.1.4 Apparatus. Eye movement data was collected using the GP3\nHD Eye Tracker, sampling at 60 Hz in accordance with recom-\nmended guidelines [Leiva et al. 2024]. This equipment provides\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution, allowing for precise tracking\nof rapid eye movements [Cuve et al. 2022]. A five-point calibra-\ntion was conducted for each participant before the study, and it\nwas repeated until minimal error was achieved. Throughout the\nexperiment, various eye movements—including fixations, saccades,\nand blinks—were recorded. The data collected included timestamps,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\n(a) Baseline\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\n(b) Edge color\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n(c) Edge thickness\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n(d) Node size\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\n(e) Node shape\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n(f) Node color\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\n(g) Full adapta-\ntion\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 1: Examples of graph adaptations, from baseline (a) to fully adapted (g) versions.

DeepGaze III [Kümmerer et al. 2022] gener-\nates a probabilistic density map for the next fixation based on input\nimages and previously observed fixation points. This approach can\nproduce clusters of closely spaced points, potentially causing stag-\nnation in those regions. To address this issue, DeepGaze++ [Jiang\net al. 2023a] iteratively selects the position with the highest probabil-\nity from the density map and applies a custom inhibition-of-return\n(IOR) decay to suppress that location in the saliency map. However,\nthe default IOR decay mechanism is effective only for a limited num-\nber of fixations. Therefore, in other research, they adopt the IOR\ndecay introduced in [Emami et al. 2024], which extends coverage\nbeyond 12 fixation points. Furthermore, they integrated the design\nparameters for this model, which was introduced in the same paper.\nDespite these adjustments, DeepGaze++ remains a state-of-the-art\nscanpath model and is thus employed in their investigation. In\nthis paper, we used this model with the IOR method introduced\nin [Emami et al. 2024], along with the optimal parameters from the\nsame paper.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n3.2.3 Gazeformer. Mondal et al. [2023] proposed a transformer-\nbased model for goal-directed human gaze prediction that encodes\ntarget objects using a language model, allowing it to generalize\nto unseen categories (ZeroGaze). The architecture consists of a\nResNet-50 [He et al. 2016] backbone for visual feature extraction\nand RoBERTa [Liu et al. 2019] for target encoding, which are com-\nbined into a shared visual-semantic space. A transformer encoder\ncontextualizes the scene, while a transformer decoder predicts fix-\nation sequences in parallel using learnable fixation queries. Fixa-\ntion locations and durations are directly regressed using a Gauss-\nian distribution-based approach. Training is formulated as a se-\nquence modeling task with a multi-task loss, including L1 regres-\nsion loss for fixation coordinates and durations, and a negative\nlog-likelihood loss for fixation validity. The model is trained on the\nCOCO-Search18 dataset [Chen et al. 2021b].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn our work, we use their available implementation and trained\ncheckpoint. We encode our questions as the task using the language\nmodel. Since the model was originally trained to predict up to\nseven fixations per stimulus, we likewise restrict our analysis to a\nmaximum of seven fixations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n3.3 Metrics\nIn the case of UMSS and Gazeformer, we generated as many scan-\npaths per image as there were participants in our study, with the\nmean evaluation scores representing the averages of all human and\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFigure 2: Each trial followed a structured sequence: fixation\ncross, question screen, graph screen, and resting period. This\nprocedure was repeated for all 120 trials.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\ngaze coordinates (x and y), and eye validity codes, with continuous\nmonitoring of data quality through real-time feedback [Duchowski\n2017].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3.2 Generative models\n3.2.1 UMSS. Proposed in [Wang et al. 2024a], it involves two main\ncomponents. The first one produces multi-duration saliency maps\nfor visualization elements and is specifically trained to capture how\nattention shifts over time based on the visual elements and their\nrelevance at different viewing stages—specifically at 0.5, 3, and 5\nseconds. It is based on the model MultiDuration Saliency Excited\nModel (MD-SEM)[Fosco et al. 2020b] that was proposed for nat-\nural images. By calculating the Element Fixation Density (EFD),\nresearchers created the MASSVIS Multi-Duration Element Fixa-\ntion Density (MASSVIS-MDEFD) using the MASSVIS dataset. This\ndataset was subsequently utilized to fine-tune MD-SEM, resulting in\nthe development of their Multi-Duration Element Attention Model\n(MD-EAM). The second component involves Probabilistic Scan-\npath Sampling using these saliency maps.

In contrast, with DeepGaze++, we gen-\nerated a single scanpath per image. For Gazeformer, we produced\nseven fixations, as the model is specifically trained to predict this\nnumber. In both DeepGaze and UMSS, we generated 12 fixations,\nreflecting the average fixation count of 12.5 per image in our dataset.\nWe used well-known scanpath prediction metrics used in [Emami\net al. 2024].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n• Dynamic Time Warping (DTW): Introduced by Berndt\nand Clifford [1994], DTW compares time series of varying\nlengths by calculating a distance matrix and finding the op-\ntimal path that adheres to boundary, continuity, and mono-\ntonicity constraints. The solution is the minimum-cost path\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nfrom the matrix’s start to its endpoint, matching two scan-\npaths iteratively while including key features [Müller 2007;\nWang et al. 2023].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• Eyenalysis: This technique involves double mapping of\nfixations between two scanpaths to reduce positional vari-\nability [Mathôt et al. 2012]. Like DTW, it may assign multi-\nple points from one scanpath to a single point in the other,\nidentifying the closest fixation points and measuring the\naverage distance between corresponding pairs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• Determinism: This metric evaluates diagonal alignments\namong cross-recurrent points, representing shared fixation\ntrajectories [Fahimi and Bruce 2021]. With a minimum\ndiagonal length of 𝑙min = 2, it measures the percentage of\nrecurrent fixation points in sub-scanpaths, enhancing the\noriginal unweighted metric by evaluating congruence in\nfixation sequences.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• Laminarity: Laminarity measures the percentage of fixa-\ntion points in sub-scanpaths where all corresponding pairs\nare recurrent, sharing the same fixation point from one\nscanpath [Anderson et al. 2015; Fahimi and Bruce 2021]. It\nindicates the tendency of scanpath fixations to cluster in\nspecific locations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n4 Results\nThe results for the three models, namely UMSS, DeepGaze++, and\nGazeformer, are reported in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, respec-\ntively. The best value for each metric appears in bold, while the\nsecond-best is underlined. An example of scanpaths for each model\nis shown in Figure 3. To ensure a fair comparison, we present the\nresults of UMSS and DeepGaze++ predicting seven fixations in the\nAppendix A.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDeepGaze++ achieves the highest quantitative performance,\nthough a visual inspection suggests that UMSS generates more\nplausible scanpaths (Figure 3). UMSS scanpaths contain more fix-\nations on nodes, aligning with findings from Matzen et al. [2018],\nwho observed that models excelling at natural scenes tend to under-\nperform on data visualisations, and vice versa. Specialised InfoVis\nmodels tend to focus more on high-information areas [Matzen et al.\n2018]. This may explain why Gazeformer exhibits the weakest per-\nformance in both quantitative metrics and scanpath plausibility\n(Figure 3), likely due to its training, which lacks InfoVis data, and\nits limitation of predicting only seven fixations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn terms of graph complexity, UMSS and DeepGaze++ per-\nform better with six-node graphs and hard-complexity questions,\nwhereas Gazeformer achieves the best results with six-node graphs\nand easy questions. In three-node graphs, question complexity has\nless influence on performance. Notably, Gazeformer, the only model\nthat explicitly encodes the question, achieves relatively strong re-\nsults despite its disadvantages, suggesting that question incorpora-\ntion plays a role in scanpath prediction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe evaluated metrics are sensitive to both the number of nodes\nin the graph and question complexity. Performance improves with\nsix-node stimuli, even when all models predict only seven fixations\n(Appendix A). This likely occurs because three-node graphs contain\nless information than the datasets used to train these models.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nMoreover, we find that scanpath predictions are significantly\ninfluenced by the training datasets of each model, as well as model-\nspecific parameters such as the number of fixations and internal\nconfiguration settings. As Emami et al. [2024] highlight, certain\nparameters heavily impact predictions and are not easily optimised.\nFor example, as shown in Appendix A.1 and Appendix A.2, both\nUMSS and DeepGaze++ exhibit metric variations, particularly in\nDTW, depending on the number of predicted fixations. Additionally,\nto generate plausible scanpaths with UMSS, we had to adapt the\nalgorithm to our specific visualization type (subsubsection 3.2.1).\nAfter analysing these three state-of-the-art models—two selected\nbased on their training datasets and one for its ability to incorporate\nquestions—we concluded that using a pretrained scanpath genera-\ntion model requires careful parameter optimization and potentially\nfine-tuning to be effective on a new dataset.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n5 Limitations and future work\nWhen evaluating the models, we did not perform fine-tuning or an\nexhaustive search for the best parameters. We replicated training or\nused pretrained checkpoints when available, although with some\nmodifications to adapt them to our data, especially in the case of\nUMSS.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs future work, it would be interesting to explore how the perfor-\nmance of these models improves when fine-tuned with this dataset.\nIn particular, Gazeformer could be further optimized by training it\nto predict more than seven fixations and by adapting it specifically\nfor this task. For instance, the model could benefit from fine-tuning\nthe ResNet module used for feature extraction, as it is not optimized\nfor InfoVis images, which differ significantly from the images it\nwas originally trained on. Also, investigate models such as Chartist\n[Shi et al. 2025] to assess their generalization capabilities on our\ntask and visualization type, different from their training data.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs a complementary analysis, it would be interesting to examine\nwhether user response accuracy affects model performance. Specif-\nically, we could study whether the models predict scanpaths more\neffectively in trials where the question was answered correctly\nversus incorrectly.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nEthical statement\nWe obtained informed consent from the participants, ensuring the\nanonymization of their data. Consequently, the ET datasets col-\nlected in this study provide anonymous records in compliance with\nethical board approvals, containing no personal information. This\napproach guarantees the privacy and anonymity of the collected\ndata. To address potential privacy concerns associated with ET data\ncollection and processing, the datasets presented are unlinkable to\nindividual participants, thus preventing any possible misuse.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAcknowledgments\nThis research is supported by Horizon Europe’s European Innova-\ntion Council through the Pathfinder program (SYMBIOTIK project,\ngrant 101071147) and by the Industrial Doctorate Plan of the Depart-\nment of Research and Universities of the Generalitat de Catalunya,\nunder Grant AGAUR 2023 DI060.\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nReferences\nNicola C Anderson, Fraser Anderson, Alan Kingstone, and Walter F Bischof. 2015.

Additionally, we filter the organic data to include only the\nfirst seven fixations and we recompute metrics in Table 5. We do the\nsame process for 12 fixations in Table 6 and Table 7. The difference\nin metrics according to the question and the number of nodes is\nconsistent, predicting a different number of fixations. DTW is the\nmetric most affected by both the number of fixations and filtering\norganic data to the same number of fixations as in the predicted se-\nquence of scanpaths. DTW achieves better values when the number\nof fixations is similar between the two compared sequences.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nA.2 DeepGaze++\nIn Table 8, we present the results of DeepGaze++ predicting seven\nfixations.

Understanding how visual attention is allocated is essential for optimizing interface design. However, collecting Eye-tracking (ET) data presents challenges re- lated to cost, privacy, and scalability. Computational models provide alternatives for predicting gaze patterns, thereby advancing Info- Vis research. In our study, we conducted an ET experiment with 40 participants who analyzed graphs while responding to ques- tions of varying complexity within the context of digital forensics. We compared human scanpaths with synthetic ones generated by models such as DeepGaze, UMSS, and Gazeformer. Our research evaluates the accuracy of these models and examines how ques- tion complexity and number of nodes influence performance. This work contributes to the development of predictive modeling in visual analytics, offering insights that can enhance the design and effectiveness of InfoVis systems.

In today’s information- saturated environment, users must decide what to process, filter, and prioritize. Although using visualizations to address this chal- lenge has been widely discussed [Perkhofer et al. 2016], InfoVis systems have yet to fully realize their potential in aiding critical decision-making. The effectiveness of InfoVis in responding to criti- cal events hinges on the visual representation of data and the speed at which actionable insights can be derived. We argue that phys- iological computing holds significant promise for innovation in InfoVis by incorporating human body signals, which can lead to   more precise user interface adaptations through closed-loop im- plicit monitoring [Fairclough 2022]. This is supported by evidence that cognitive processes are affected by user interface aesthetics, detectable through physiological signals [Haddad et al. 2024; Hirsh- field et al. 2011; Lukanov et al. 2016; Peck et al. 2013]. Specifically, visual attention allocation in graphic design reflects the perceived importance of design elements [Cartella et al. 2024]. Understanding how users allocate their attention presents a research opportu- nity [Emami et al. 2024].   In the context of visual attention, we can differentiate between bottom-up saliency, which arises from low-level visual features like color, contrast, and motion, capturing attention automatically. In contrast, top-down saliency is shaped by prior knowledge, tasks, and goals, guiding attention based on relevance [Wang et al. 2024a]. While bottom-up saliency is driven by stimuli, top-down saliency is cognitive and context-dependent [Wang et al. 2024a]. InfoVis mainly involves top-down processing as users engage with visual representations [Wang et al. 2024a].   To model visual attention, Eye-tracking (ET) is typically used. However, collecting organic data presents significant challenges, including the reliance on proprietary, high-precision equipment and data privacy concerns [Khurana et al. 2023]. Recent studies have addressed the limitations of ET technology by introducing computational attention models, a promising alternative to predict gaze patterns in response to specific stimuli [Deng et al. 2023]. In the field of Computer Vision (CV), predictive models of human attention have demonstrated their utility across various applica- tions, including the optimization of interaction designs and the enhancement of webpage layouts [Li et al. 2024]. To train and eval- uate these models, scientific datasets containing fixation points generated by human observers exploring images on specific tasks have been developed. These datasets are typically captured using eye-trackers, webcams [Assens et al. 2018] and mouse clicks with techniques like BubbleView [Kim et al. 2017]. Popular examples are MASSVIS [Borkin et al. 2016], and UEyes dataset [Jiang et al. 2023a] for InfoVis and SALICON [Jiang et al. 2015] and CAT2000 [Borji and Itti 2015] for natural images.   Typically, existing solutions predict either visual attention [Ay- demir et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023; Fosco et al. 2020a], also referred to as saliency modeling, or scanpaths, which is also regarded as   another form of saliency prediction that accounts for the temporal dimension [Kümmerer et al. 2022; Martin et al. 2022; Sui et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2024a]. Saliency prediction aims to generate heatmaps or probability distributions that emphasize areas of attention within an image [Cartella et al. 2024]. Contemporary approaches utilize deep neural networks to automatically learn discriminative fea- tures, as evidenced by models such as those proposed by Chen et al. [2023] and Aydemir et al. [2023]. Aydemir et al. [2023].   However, collapsing attention prediction to saliency maps re- sults in the loss of temporal information of attentional deploy- ment [Cartella et al. 2024]. Two scanpaths that cover similar areas of an image, but follow entirely different sequences, can yield identi- cal saliency maps. Nevertheless, the order in which a visual stimulus is explored is important, as it more accurately reflects the promi- nence of the image elements in relation to the observer [Cartella et al. 2024]. This has driven research into the complementary task of scanpath prediction—the task of forecasting a sequence of fixations over a visual stimulus. Certain models for predicting scanpaths in images have been proposed, with recent efforts placing more emphasis on deep learning solutions (e.g., TPP-Gaze [D’Amelio et al. 2024]). While most models are based on free-viewing human scanpaths, the former ones emerge for InfoVis [Wang et al. 2024a]. Specific models are needed since InfoVis stimuli are fundamentally different from natural images: they typically include more text and larger areas with uniform color and minimal to no texture [Matzen et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2024a].   By modeling eye movement patterns based on visual saliency, we can gain insights into user perception and interaction, reduc- ing the need to involve users early in the design process [Emami et al. 2024; Shi et al. 2025]. These predictions enable us to measure the impact of visual changes in InfoVis, optimize design compo- nents for specific attention levels, and evaluate user awareness of elements over time [Emami et al. 2024]. Such solutions could be used as an evaluation tool, which visualization designers can use to compare candidate designs in either a qualitative or quantitative manner [Matzen et al. 2018]. Modelling scanpaths on InfoVis can offer insights into the rich spatial and temporal dynamics of human attention [Wang et al. 2024a].   In this paper, we conducted a ET study with 40 participants who analysed graphs of different numbers of nodes, while answering questions of varying complexity in the context of digital forensics. We investigated how similar these gaze patterns are to synthetic scanpaths produced by various generative models: DeepGaze [Küm- merer et al. 2022], UMSS [Wang et al. 2024a] and Gazeformer [Mon- dal et al. 2023]. Our objective is to determine which state-of-the-art generative model can most effectively synthesise realistic scanpaths on graph-based visualizations and how the question and visualisa- tion complexity impacts their accuracy.   2 Related work Eye-tracking is extensively used in InfoVis as it offers valuable insights into information foraging and decision-making processes, thereby informing research on visual attention [Borkin et al. 2016] [Nguyen et al. 2017].   Considering the different conditions in visual analysis tasks, Po- latsek et al. [2018] explored how visual attention and perception   influence task-based analysis. By examining the MASSVIS dataset, their study demonstrated that free-viewing saliency models fall short in capturing the nuances of task-driven attention, suggesting that these models require further refinement. Following that, Wang et al. [2024b] created the SalChartQA dataset, a human-annotated Chart Question Answering dataset covering three visualization types: bar plots, line plots, and pie charts. Analyses on SalChartQA demonstrate the strong impact of the question on visual saliency. However, this study does not analyze graph-based visualizations and collects data using BubbleView [Kim et al. 2017].   Early research on scanpath prediction has primarily utilized bottom-up saliency maps to predict gaze shifts and positions. No- table models, such as SalTiNet [Assens et al. 2017], introduced a deep learning framework that innovatively represents saliency maps in three dimensions, termed saliency volumes. This structure captures the temporal aspect of fixations by adding a temporal axis to traditional saliency maps. Scanpaths are generated by sampling fixation points from these saliency volumes, followed by a post- filtering stage. PathGAN [Assens et al. 2018] advanced this by offer- ing a fully end-to-end solution, employing a generative adversarial network (GAN) to directly produce scanpaths without the need for sampling or post-processing. DeepGaze III [Kümmerer et al. 2022] improved prediction using saliency maps and previous scanpaths to forecast subsequent fixations, establishing itself as the state-of- the-art for generating free-viewing human scanpaths. Later, Jiang et al. [2023b] introduced DeepGaze++ based on DeepGaze III with modifications and fine-tuned it on the UEyes dataset. Emami et al. [2024] optimized the parameters of DeepGaze++, such as masking radius, IOR mechanisms and input image size for user interfaces, relevant to InfoVis. So we consider this version of DeepGaze++ as the state-of-the-art model for scanpath prediction with these parameters.   Recently, there has been a growing interest in visual attention models for InfoVis, as demonstrated by Matzen et al. [2018] who ex- amined the limitations of existing saliency models on the MASSVIS dataset. Their findings motivated the development of the Data Visu- alization Saliency (DVS) model to better address these shortcomings. However, scanpath prediction remains underexplored, with UMSS [Wang et al. 2024a] emerging as the first notable contribution and serving as the state-of-the-art model in this area. Moreover, current methods typically generate visual attention maps without consid- ering user questions or queries [Shi et al. 2025]. The investigation of goal-directed attention—such as that required for visual search tasks—remains in its early stages [Cartella et al. 2024]. In InfoVis, research on question-driven saliency and scanpath prediction is especially recent.   For saliency, VisSalFormer [Wang et al. 2024b] remains the only method available for predicting question-driven saliency on infor- mation visualizations. In terms of scanpaths, Chartist [Shi et al. 2025] is the only available model; it simulates how users move their eyes to forage information on a chart—handling tasks such as value retrieval, filtering, and identifying extremes. Although Chartist was developed around the same time as this work, its code was not available, so a direct comparison was ommitted from our study. Moreover, since it is trained in a controlled environment rather than using human eye-tracking data, it opens a promising direction for future research.   In the context of visual question answering, models like Chen et al. [Chen et al. 2021a] combine visual-question-answering frame- works with a ConvLSTM module to predict fixation position distri- butions and durations based on questions related to natural images. Recently, Gazeformer [Mondal et al. 2023] proposed using a Trans- former model to regress fixation coordinates within a scanpath focused on object searching, conditioned on the embedding of the object’s name from a pre-trained language model. For all these reasons, we considered Gazeformer to be the state-of-the-art model for scanpath prediction in goal-directed attention.   Although these models are useful, they often depend on task- specific configurations that limit their generalizability. UniAR [Li et al. 2024] overcomes this by predicting scanpaths and saliency while also incorporating user input preferences across tasks. While promising, its closed-source nature prevented us from including it in our work.   3 Methodology This section describes the methodology employed in this study, detailing the data collection process, the generative models used, and the evaluation metrics. The Data Collection subsection outlines participant recruitment Section 3.1.1, the stimuli used Section 3.1.2, task procedureSection 3.1.3, and the experimental apparatus Sec- tion 3.1.4. The Generative Models subsection introduces the models applied in the study Section 3.2 followed by a description of the metrics used for evaluation Section 3.3.   3.1 Data Collection The data was collected with the purpose of exploring the impact of different InfoVis adaptations in the context of digital forensics. However, the focus of this work is to investigate the impact of question complexity and number of nodes, and not the nature of the adaptation.   3.1.1 Participants. We recruited 40 participants with a mean age of 27.2 years (SD=4.9) through mailing lists and university portal advertisements. Inclusion criteria required participants to be aged 18 to 65 years, have no history of neurological disorders and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants also needed to understand and follow the experiment instructions and provide written informed consent before participating.   Stimuli. We consider undirected graphs, to convey infor- 3.1.2 mation about criminal records, such as numbers of arrests or in- carceration states. This is the most common visualization type in this domain [Bohm et al. 2021; Osborne and Slay 2011]. In this environment, nodes represent people, while the edges indicate their relationships. We followed a within-subjects design, where all participants were exposed to all experimental conditions but in randomized order.   We consider two levels of visual complexity: graphs with three (3) or six (6) nodes. Each graph was presented as one of three different configurations:   Baseline: Graphs without any visual adaptation (see example   in Figure 1a).   Partial adaptation: Graphs with only one visual adaptation   taneously (see example in Figure 1g).   We consider five possible visual adaptations, based on principles of effective information visualization [Gelman and Unwin 2013; Knoblich et al. 2024; Shen et al. 2021] and popular guidelines,1 where for example color is used for categorization and size is used to convey quantitative information:   Edge color: Indicates whether individuals share matching   birthplaces (Figure 1b).   Edge thickness: Represents the strength of the connection   between individuals (Figure 1c).   Node size: Represents the number of arrests made by an in-   dividual (Figure 1d).   Node shape: Distinguishes whether the person is currently   in jail (Figure 1e).   Node color: Indicates the gender of the individual (Figure 1f). We prepared a set of questions to assess the participants’ ability to interpret the graphs under varying levels of complexity. The ques- tions designed to be answered based on the information conveyed in the graph and were categorized according to their difficulty:   Easy questions: These involved simple queries that required a straightforward interpretation of the graph (e.g., How many people are in jail?).   Hard questions: These required a more in-depth analysis and a higher level of cognitive processing (e.g., How many people with the same birthplace are connected to people with more than two arrests?).   Our independent variables are the numbers of nodes (three and   six) and question difficulty (two factors: easy and hard).   3.1.3 Task and Procedure.   Participants completed 15 practice trials to familiarize them- selves with the task. The experiment was conducted in a dimly lit room to minimize distractions and optimize eye-tracking data quality. The main experiment consisted of 120 trials per participant (30 for each of our analysed categories). Each trial began with a 1-second fixation cross, followed by a self-paced question-reading phase (Figure 2). Participants then viewed a graph and had 10 seconds to respond before the system advanced to the next trial au- tomatically. Participants provided single-digit responses as quickly and accurately as possible or pressed ‘n’ if they could not answer. A self-paced resting period followed each trial before proceeding. This cycle repeated for 120 trials, with the experiment lasting about 30 minutes and all trials randomized.   3.1.4 Apparatus. Eye movement data was collected using the GP3 HD Eye Tracker, sampling at 60 Hz in accordance with recom- mended guidelines [Leiva et al. 2024]. This equipment provides high spatial and temporal resolution, allowing for precise tracking of rapid eye movements [Cuve et al. 2022]. A five-point calibra- tion was conducted for each participant before the study, and it was repeated until minimal error was achieved. Throughout the experiment, various eye movements—including fixations, saccades, and blinks—were recorded. The data collected included timestamps,   Figure 1: Examples of graph adaptations, from baseline (a) to fully adapted (g) versions. Figures b-f represent the five possible partial adaptations.   3.2.2 DeepGaze++. DeepGaze III [Kümmerer et al. 2022] gener- ates a probabilistic density map for the next fixation based on input images and previously observed fixation points. This approach can produce clusters of closely spaced points, potentially causing stag- nation in those regions. To address this issue, DeepGaze++ [Jiang et al. 2023a] iteratively selects the position with the highest probabil- ity from the density map and applies a custom inhibition-of-return (IOR) decay to suppress that location in the saliency map. However, the default IOR decay mechanism is effective only for a limited num- ber of fixations. Therefore, in other research, they adopt the IOR decay introduced in [Emami et al. 2024], which extends coverage beyond 12 fixation points. Furthermore, they integrated the design parameters for this model, which was introduced in the same paper. Despite these adjustments, DeepGaze++ remains a state-of-the-art scanpath model and is thus employed in their investigation. In this paper, we used this model with the IOR method introduced in [Emami et al. 2024], along with the optimal parameters from the same paper.   3.2.3 Gazeformer. Mondal et al. [2023] proposed a transformer- based model for goal-directed human gaze prediction that encodes target objects using a language model, allowing it to generalize to unseen categories (ZeroGaze). The architecture consists of a ResNet-50 [He et al. 2016] backbone for visual feature extraction and RoBERTa [Liu et al. 2019] for target encoding, which are com- bined into a shared visual-semantic space. A transformer encoder contextualizes the scene, while a transformer decoder predicts fix- ation sequences in parallel using learnable fixation queries. Fixa- tion locations and durations are directly regressed using a Gauss- ian distribution-based approach. Training is formulated as a se- quence modeling task with a multi-task loss, including L1 regres- sion loss for fixation coordinates and durations, and a negative log-likelihood loss for fixation validity. The model is trained on the COCO-Search18 dataset [Chen et al. 2021b].   In our work, we use their available implementation and trained checkpoint. We encode our questions as the task using the language model. Since the model was originally trained to predict up to seven fixations per stimulus, we likewise restrict our analysis to a maximum of seven fixations.   3.3 Metrics In the case of UMSS and Gazeformer, we generated as many scan- paths per image as there were participants in our study, with the mean evaluation scores representing the averages of all human and   Figure 2: Each trial followed a structured sequence: fixation cross, question screen, graph screen, and resting period. This procedure was repeated for all 120 trials.   gaze coordinates (x and y), and eye validity codes, with continuous monitoring of data quality through real-time feedback [Duchowski 2017].   3.2 Generative models 3.2.1 UMSS. Proposed in [Wang et al. 2024a], it involves two main components. The first one produces multi-duration saliency maps for visualization elements and is specifically trained to capture how attention shifts over time based on the visual elements and their relevance at different viewing stages—specifically at 0.5, 3, and 5 seconds. It is based on the model MultiDuration Saliency Excited Model (MD-SEM)[Fosco et al. 2020b] that was proposed for nat- ural images. By calculating the Element Fixation Density (EFD), researchers created the MASSVIS Multi-Duration Element Fixa- tion Density (MASSVIS-MDEFD) using the MASSVIS dataset. This dataset was subsequently utilized to fine-tune MD-SEM, resulting in the development of their Multi-Duration Element Attention Model (MD-EAM). The second component involves Probabilistic Scan- path Sampling using these saliency maps. UMSS probabilistically samples gaze locations to predict the sequence of fixations.   We have successfully replicated their training process and com- puted both saliency maps and scanpath predictions over a duration of five seconds, consistent with their original implementation. In our images, the stimuli (nodes) are typically positioned at the top or bottom rather than in the center, which makes the initial scanpath sampling algorithm ineffective. To customize the model for our data, we introduce a weighting factor that integrates the saliency prediction with its Gaussian mask during the scanpath sampling process.

In contrast, with DeepGaze++, we gen- erated a single scanpath per image. For Gazeformer, we produced seven fixations, as the model is specifically trained to predict this number. In both DeepGaze and UMSS, we generated 12 fixations, reflecting the average fixation count of 12.5 per image in our dataset. We used well-known scanpath prediction metrics used in [Emami et al. 2024].   • Dynamic Time Warping (DTW): Introduced by Berndt and Clifford [1994], DTW compares time series of varying lengths by calculating a distance matrix and finding the op- timal path that adheres to boundary, continuity, and mono- tonicity constraints. The solution is the minimum-cost path   from the matrix’s start to its endpoint, matching two scan- paths iteratively while including key features [Müller 2007; Wang et al. 2023].   • Eyenalysis: This technique involves double mapping of fixations between two scanpaths to reduce positional vari- ability [Mathôt et al. 2012]. Like DTW, it may assign multi- ple points from one scanpath to a single point in the other, identifying the closest fixation points and measuring the average distance between corresponding pairs.   • Determinism: This metric evaluates diagonal alignments among cross-recurrent points, representing shared fixation trajectories [Fahimi and Bruce 2021]. With a minimum diagonal length of 𝑙min = 2, it measures the percentage of recurrent fixation points in sub-scanpaths, enhancing the original unweighted metric by evaluating congruence in fixation sequences.   • Laminarity: Laminarity measures the percentage of fixa- tion points in sub-scanpaths where all corresponding pairs are recurrent, sharing the same fixation point from one scanpath [Anderson et al. 2015; Fahimi and Bruce 2021]. It indicates the tendency of scanpath fixations to cluster in specific locations.   4 Results The results for the three models, namely UMSS, DeepGaze++, and Gazeformer, are reported in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, respec- tively. The best value for each metric appears in bold, while the second-best is underlined. An example of scanpaths for each model is shown in Figure 3. To ensure a fair comparison, we present the results of UMSS and DeepGaze++ predicting seven fixations in the Appendix A.   DeepGaze++ achieves the highest quantitative performance, though a visual inspection suggests that UMSS generates more plausible scanpaths (Figure 3). UMSS scanpaths contain more fix- ations on nodes, aligning with findings from Matzen et al. [2018], who observed that models excelling at natural scenes tend to under- perform on data visualisations, and vice versa. Specialised InfoVis models tend to focus more on high-information areas [Matzen et al. 2018]. This may explain why Gazeformer exhibits the weakest per- formance in both quantitative metrics and scanpath plausibility (Figure 3), likely due to its training, which lacks InfoVis data, and its limitation of predicting only seven fixations.   In terms of graph complexity, UMSS and DeepGaze++ per- form better with six-node graphs and hard-complexity questions, whereas Gazeformer achieves the best results with six-node graphs and easy questions. In three-node graphs, question complexity has less influence on performance. Notably, Gazeformer, the only model that explicitly encodes the question, achieves relatively strong re- sults despite its disadvantages, suggesting that question incorpora- tion plays a role in scanpath prediction.   The evaluated metrics are sensitive to both the number of nodes in the graph and question complexity. Performance improves with six-node stimuli, even when all models predict only seven fixations (Appendix A). This likely occurs because three-node graphs contain less information than the datasets used to train these models.   Moreover, we find that scanpath predictions are significantly influenced by the training datasets of each model, as well as model- specific parameters such as the number of fixations and internal configuration settings. As Emami et al. [2024] highlight, certain parameters heavily impact predictions and are not easily optimised. For example, as shown in Appendix A.1 and Appendix A.2, both UMSS and DeepGaze++ exhibit metric variations, particularly in DTW, depending on the number of predicted fixations. Additionally, to generate plausible scanpaths with UMSS, we had to adapt the algorithm to our specific visualization type (subsubsection 3.2.1). After analysing these three state-of-the-art models—two selected based on their training datasets and one for its ability to incorporate questions—we concluded that using a pretrained scanpath genera- tion model requires careful parameter optimization and potentially fine-tuning to be effective on a new dataset.   5 Limitations and future work When evaluating the models, we did not perform fine-tuning or an exhaustive search for the best parameters. We replicated training or used pretrained checkpoints when available, although with some modifications to adapt them to our data, especially in the case of UMSS.   As future work, it would be interesting to explore how the perfor- mance of these models improves when fine-tuned with this dataset. In particular, Gazeformer could be further optimized by training it to predict more than seven fixations and by adapting it specifically for this task. For instance, the model could benefit from fine-tuning the ResNet module used for feature extraction, as it is not optimized for InfoVis images, which differ significantly from the images it was originally trained on. Also, investigate models such as Chartist [Shi et al. 2025] to assess their generalization capabilities on our task and visualization type, different from their training data.   As a complementary analysis, it would be interesting to examine whether user response accuracy affects model performance. Specif- ically, we could study whether the models predict scanpaths more effectively in trials where the question was answered correctly versus incorrectly.   Ethical statement We obtained informed consent from the participants, ensuring the anonymization of their data. Consequently, the ET datasets col- lected in this study provide anonymous records in compliance with ethical board approvals, containing no personal information. This approach guarantees the privacy and anonymity of the collected data. To address potential privacy concerns associated with ET data collection and processing, the datasets presented are unlinkable to individual participants, thus preventing any possible misuse.

Appendix A Additional results A.1 UMSS In Table 4, we present the results of UMSS predicting seven fixa- tions. Additionally, we filter the organic data to include only the first seven fixations and we recompute metrics in Table 5. We do the same process for 12 fixations in Table 6 and Table 7. The difference in metrics according to the question and the number of nodes is consistent, predicting a different number of fixations. DTW is the metric most affected by both the number of fixations and filtering organic data to the same number of fixations as in the predicted se- quence of scanpaths. DTW achieves better values when the number of fixations is similar between the two compared sequences.   A.2 DeepGaze++ In Table 8, we present the results of DeepGaze++ predicting seven fixations. Additionally, we filter the organic data to include only the first seven fixations and we recompute metrics in Table 9. We do the same process for 12 fixations in Table 10 and Table 11. Similarly as explained in subsection A.1, the most affected metric by filtering is DTW.   A.3 Gazeformer In Table 12, we present the results of Gazeformer predicting seven fixations. Additionally, we filter the organic data to include only the first seven fixations and we recompute metrics in Table 13.

Employing a\ndual-temperature control system, we independently manipulate the cell body and\nstem temperatures to explore Doppler and collisional effects on the spectrum.\nOur results show how the Voigt spectral profile changes from Gaussian- to\nLorentzian-dominated forms due to pressure broadening and shifts caused by\ncollisions between potassium atoms and neon. Our measurements are in excellent\nagreement with the literature values for potassium-neon collisions. For the\nfirst time we were able to incorporate the buffer-gas shift and broadening into\nthe modified Voigt profile via the ElecSus code, and found excellent agreement\nbetween the predicted and measured line profiles. We also analyse the potassium\nD1 spectral lines in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime using strong magnetic\nfields, demonstrating how Zeeman splitting modifies the pressure-broadened line\nshape.

This\nhybridization process is  crucial for understanding the unique\nproperties  of  HF  systems.  Traditionally,  the  nature  of !\nelectrons  in HF compounds  was  believed to  be temperature\ndependent  [3,  4]:  above  the  coherence  temperature  (T*), !\nelectrons  were  considered  localized,  while  below  T*,  they\nwere  thought  to  hybridize  with  conduction  electrons,  form\ning  delocalized,  heavy  quasiparticles.  Significant  progress\nhas  been  made  in  recent  years,  both  experimentally,  such\nas  angle-resolved photoemission  spectroscopy  (ARPES)  [5-\n14]  and ultrafast optical spectroscopy measurements [15-17],\nand  theoretically  [18,  19].  ARPES  studies  on  Ce- [5-10],\nYb- [11,  12],  and  U-based  [13,  14]  HF  systems  have  chal\nlenged this conventional view.  These  studies reveal the pres\nence of hybridization even at temperatures significantly above\nT*,  suggesting  a more nuanced picture of !-electron behav\nior.  Furthermore, some ARPES  investigations have even sug\ngested the relocalization of !-electrons at lower temperatures\n[8-10,  14],  further  complicating  the  understanding  of these\nsystems.

This  results  in the formation  of an indi\nrect hybridization gap at T*  [15-17].  These intriguing obser\nvations  highlight  the  complex  nature  of !-electron behavior\nin HF materials and underscore the need for further investiga\ntion.  While significant progress has been made in understand\ning hybridization dynamics in two- and three-dimensional HF\nsystems,  the  role  of dimensionality  remains  an  open  ques\ntion.  It is  believed  that the  nature  of unconventional  super\nconductivity,  quantum  criticality,  and  non-Fermi  liquid  be\nhavior  are  strongly  influenced  by  the  dimensionality  of the\nsystem.  Therefore,  exploring the effect of dimensionality on\nhybridization and the resulting emergent phenomena is crucial\nfor a complete understanding of HF systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.4**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nCeC02Gas,  a  recently  synthesized  quasi-one-dimensional\n(quasi-1D)  Kondo  lattice  compound,  presents  a  unique  op\nportunity  to  explore  the  interplay  of dimensionality  and  HF\nphysics.  This  material  exhibits  a  quantum  critical  point  at\nambient pressure [20], displaying significant anisotropy in its\nmagnetic susceptibility [20], resistivity [21], and optical spec\ntra [22].  The crystal structure, with Ce atoms forming chains\nalong  the  c-axis  isolated by  C0Ga9  cages  [20,  23],  leads  to\nquasi-1D heavy electron Fermi surfaces, as predicted by first\nprinciples  calculations  [20].  Transport  measurements  reveal\nincoherent Kondo scattering with an onset temperature of TJP\n~ 90-100  K  [21,  24,  25]  and  the  emergence  of Kondo  co\nherence  at  T*  ,:::;  20  K  [21,  24].  Notably,  coherence  is  ob\nserved  only  when  the  current  is  applied  parallel  to  the  Ce\nchains [21, 24].  Furthermore, non-Fermi liquid behavior with\na linear temperature dependence is  observed below 2 K,  per\nsisting  down  to  0.07  K  without  long-range  magnetic  order\n[20,  26].

The  pump  and  probe  beam polarizations  were\nmaintained orthogonal to each other.  For a probe beam per\npendicular to  the c-axis  of the  sample,  it  is  referred to  as  s\npolarization, while for a parallel orientation, it is referred to as\np-polarization.  To  minimize surface contamination,  all mea\nsurements  were conducted on freshly  cleaved surfaces under\nhigh vacuum  (better than  10-6  mbar).

Furthermore,\nbelow approximately 90 K,  a fast component with a negative\namplitude becomes increasingly prominent as the temperature\ndecreases.  This low-temperature component exhibits a slower\nrelaxation time and grows in amplitude with decreasing tem\nperature,  potentially  signaling  the  opening  of a  low-energy\ngap in the density of states  [17].

For p\nacross  the  measured  temperature  range  [Fig.\npolarization,  the  relaxation  dynamics  exhibit  a  temperature\ndependent  crossover.  Below  90  K,  a  three-exponential  de\ncay  function  is  required  for  accurate  fitting,  whereas  above\n90 K, a two-exponential function  (with A2 = 0)  suffices  [Fig.\nl(b)](See Figs.

For  s-polarization,  both A2  and  -r2  increase\nrapidly with decreasing temperature below rt, showing a no\ntable slope change rather than a sharp transition due to fitting\nuncertainties.  A significant anomaly around 30 K [Figs.  2(al)\nand  2(a2)]  suggests  a  possible  transition  near  this  tempera\nture.  For  p-polarization,  the  amplitude  and  relaxation  time\nparameters  show  an  anomaly  around  rt ~ 90 K,  coinciding\nwith the  onset of incoherent  Kondo  scattering  between con\nduction  electrons  and  localized !-moments  [20,  25].  Below\nrt, A2 increases rapidly and continues to grow with decreas\ning  temperature,  without  any  obvious  anomalies  around  30\nK.  This  contrast highlights  a  significant anisotropy  in  quasi\nparticle  relaxation.  Similar intermediate-temperature behav\nior has  been reported  in  other  strongly  correlated  materials,\nsuch as heavy fermions  [15-17, 35]  and high-temperature su\nperconductors  [27,  28],  often  attributed  to  the  formation  of\nhybridization gaps and pseudogaps, respectively.  Notably, for\np-polarization,  A2 reaches  a  maximum  slightly  below  20  K\nbefore decreasing at lower temperatures, possibly due to elec\ntron redistribution caused by  anisotropic  hybridization,  war\nranting further investigation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.4**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe  temperature  dependence  of the  amplitude  and  relax\nation time below rt can be described by the Rothwarf-Taylor\n(RT)  model  [36],  which  captures  the  time  evolution  of cou\npled quasiparticles and bosons in the presence of a narrow en\nergy gap (A)  in the electron density of states (DOS) near Ep.\nIn this framework, excited quasiparticles with energy exceed\ning the gap recombine,  releasing high-frequency bosons that\ncan subsequently re-excite electron-hole pairs.  The RT model\nhas  been  successfully  applied  to  various  correlated  systems\n[15-17, 27-31]. According to the RT model, the gap function\ncan be  quantitatively  extracted from  the following  equations\n[31,  32]:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.4**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nwhere nT  is the thermal quasiparticle density.

Fitting -r2 (r) and n} (r) above and below 30 K, us\ning a temperature-independent constant gap A,  yields  energy\ngaps  of 2A.i;,  ~ 50  meV  and  2A;nd  ~ 14  meV,  respectively,\nwith p  = 0.5 from a typical BCS-like DOS  [32].  We propose\nthat the smaller energy gap,  A;nd,  is  an indirect hybridization\ngap  emerging  slightly  above  the  coherence  temperature  r•\ndetermined from transport measurements.  The larger energy\ngap,  Act;,,  is  a direct hybridization  gap that persists  up  to  90\nK due  to  hybridization fluctuations,  a phenomenon observed\nby ARPES in other heavy fermion compounds well above r•\nand preceding the emergence of the fully opened indirect hy\nbridization  gap  at  r*,  characterized by band bending  [5-9].\nAs indicated by the solid cyan lines in Figs.  2(bl) and 2(b2),\nfitting  -r2(r) and n}(r) using a temperature-independent con\nstant gap A yields an energy gap of 2Adir ~ 52 me V,  also with\np  = 0.5.  The observed difference in relaxation dynamics be\ntweens- and p- polarizations likely stems from the anisotropic\nelectronic  structure caused by its  quasi-1 D  crystal  structure.\nThis leads to anisotropic quasiparticle dynamics and uniaxial\nhybridization  in  CeC02Gas,  which  is  supported  by  infrared\nspectroscopy results that hybridization occurs predominantly\nalong the c-axis [22].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.4**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAlthough ultrafast  spectroscopy lacks  the momentum res\nolution  of  ARPES,  it  can  still  reflect  the  anisotropy  of\nquasiparticle relaxation,  as  demonstrated in iron-based high\ntemperature  superconductors  with nematic  fluctuations  [28].\nThe reflectivity  signal contains information about quasiparti-\n**BLOCK**fs== 6.8**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.8**\nDelay\u0000Time\u0000(ps)\n**BLOCK**fs== 6.8**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.6**\nDelay\u0000Time\u0000(ps)\n**BLOCK**fs== 5.9**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\n\u0000fit\n\u0000fit_extending\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.5**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFIG. 3.

For\ns-polarization,  the reflectivity  signal  is  more  sensitive  to  re\nlaxation along the c-axis.  Conversely,  for p-polarization,  re\nlaxation perpendicular to  the c-axis  contributes  more  signifi\ncantly.  Therefore, regardless of the polarization direction, the\nreflectivity can reflect hybridization information and provide\nthe onset temperature rt of hybridization fluctuations.  How\never, for p-polarization, the reflectivity signal is less sensitive\nto  quasiparticle dynamics related to  c-axis hybridization,  ex\nplaining the absence of a clear anomaly around 30 K.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.4**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo  further  investigate  the  underlying  mechanism  of  hy\nbridization and its  dependence on excitation density,  we per\nformed pump fluence-dependence transient reflectivity exper\niments for s-polarization,  as  shown in  Fig.  3(a).  The M/R\nsignal exhibits a complex dependence on pump fluence,  with\nboth the amplitude and the relaxation dynamics changing sig\nnificantly.  Figure  3(b)  presents  a  2D  pseudocolor  map  of\nM/R as  a  function  of pump-probe  delay  time  and  fluence,\nclearly illustrating this fluence  dependence.  Notably, the evo\nlution of the transient reflectivity with increasing fluence  dif\nfers  significantly from  that observed with increasing temper\nature  [Fig.  l(a)],  highlighting  the  distinct  nature  of the  two\nexcitation methods.  While increasing temperature results in a\ndecrease in the initial reflectivity change, increasing pump flu\nence results in a more pronounced initial reflectivity drop ac\ncompanied by increasingly strong secondary rising peak.  This\nsuggests that the underlying mechanisms at play are different.\nThe  transient  reflectivity  can  be  fitted  with  a  three\nexponential decay function across the entire measured fluence\nrange,  allowing  us  to  extract  the  fluence  dependence  of the\namplitudes.  Figure  3(c)  summarizes  the  fluence  dependence\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.4**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nof the amplitude  IA2I- At low fluence,  IA2I  grows monotoni\ncally with increasing fluence,  exhibiting  a near-linear depen\ndence up to F  ~ 60 µJlcm2 ,  as depicted by the black dashed\nline.  This  initial linear regime  suggests  a direct relationship\nbetween the number of excited quasi particles and the observed\nreflectivity change.  For HF compounds at low temperatures,\nthe relationship between the amplitude A and pump fluence F\nhas been proposed as  [33]:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.4**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhere  c  is  a  fitting  parameter.  We  find  that  Eq.  (4)  accu\nrately describes the fluence dependence of IA2 I for fluences F\n:S  300 µJ/cm2 ,  as  shown by the  solid green line in 3(c). This\nagreement suggests that, in this  lower fluence regime, the ul\ntrafast dynamics  are dominated by the physics  of the  Kondo\neffect.  As  the  fluence  increases,  the  observed  faster  relax\nation, indicated by the narrowing of the initial negative peak,\ncan be attributed to the gradual suppression of the hybridiza\ntion  gap[33].  As  the  fluence  increases,  a  larger  number  of\nquasiparticles are excited, effectively screening the local mo\nments  and  reducing  the  hybridization  strength,  thus  leading\nto  a faster  decay.  This  characteristic fluence  of 300 µJ/cm2 ,\nwhere we  observe  a deviation from the  prediction of the RT\nmodel,  can be  compared to  similar studies  on other HF sys\ntems,  although direct comparisons should be made with cau\ntion due to varying experimental conditions and definitions of\nthis  characteristic  fluence.  For example,  CeAuSb2  has  been\nreported  to  have  a  similar characteristic  fluence  of approxi\nmately 200 µJ/cm2  at 3.8  K [17],  while CeAgSb2  exhibits  a\nchange  in behavior  at  a  lower  fluence,  less  than  60  µJ/cm2\nat 12 K  [35],  and YbB12  requires a higher fluence,  exceeding\n0.4 mJ/cm2 [37].  These differences may reflect variations in\nthe  strength  and robustness  of the  hybridization gap  in these\nmaterials.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.4**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nHowever, beyond 300 µJ/cm2 , the behavior of IA2 I deviates\nfrom  the  prediction of Eq.  (4).  The  rate  of increase in  IA2I\nslows  down,  while  the  relaxation  dynamics  evolve,  charac\nterized by a more pronounced initial negative peak in the tran\nsient reflectivity signal, followed by a more distinct secondary\nrising peak.  This deviation indicates that the strong photoex -\ncitation  in  this  higher  fluence  regime  leads  to  a  qualitative\nchange in the  system's dynamics.  We  attribute this  to the in\ntense pumping effectively disentangling the hybridization be\ntween  the  conduction  and  4f bands,  resulting  in  the  smear\ning  of the  hybridization  gap  or  even  a  photoinduced  phase\ntransition [17, 33], along with the emergence of additional re\nlaxation pathways.  This disentangling of the hybridization is\nconsistent with the small indirect hybridization gap (li;nd)  ob\nserved at low temperatures, which implies a weak hybridiza\ntion strength that is susceptible to strong photoexcitation. The\nobserved changes  in the transient reflectivity profile,  includ\ning the more pronounced negative peak and more pronounced\nsecondary rising peak, suggest that these additional relaxation\nprocesses contribute significantly to the observed signal.  Fur\nther investigation, possibly involving modeling of the excited\nstate  dynamics,  would be needed to  fully  elucidate the com\nplex processes occurring in this high-fluence regime.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn conclusion,  we  report  an  ultrafast  optical  spectroscopy\nstudy of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice CeCo2Ga8.\nOur  measurements  reveal  strong  anisotropy  in  the  transient\nreflectivity,  reflecting the material's unique structure.  We ob\nserve  two  distinct  types  of hybridization  gaps:  a  direct  gap\nthat persists up rt ;::; 90 K, associated with hybridization fluc\ntuations, and an indirect gap emerging at a lower temperature\nslightly  above  T*  ;::;  20  K,  where  coherent Kondo  screening\ndevelops.

         " Anisotropic Hybridization Dynamics in the Quasi-One-Dimensional Kondo Lattice CeCo2Ga8 Revealed by Ultrafast Optical Spectroscopy   The  intricate  coupling  of  spin,  orbital,  charge,  and  lat tice  degrees  of freedom  in  strongly  correlated  electron  sys tems  gives  rise  to  a  rich  tapestry  of  emergent  phenomena and  complex  phase  diagrams.  Heavy  fermion  (HF)  materi als,  characterized by partially filled 4f or 5 f  orbitals,  exem plify this  complexity.  In these  systems,  the  delicate balance between the  Kondo  effect and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida  (RKKY) interaction governs  the  low-energy physics, leading to a variety of fascinating ground states, including un conventional superconductivity, quantum criticality,  and non Fermi liquid behavior [1,  2].   A hallmark of HF behavior is the emergence of a hybridiza tion gap,  a narrow energy scale arising from the coupling be tween  localized !-electrons  and  conduction  electrons.  This hybridization process is  crucial for understanding the unique properties  of  HF  systems.  Traditionally,  the  nature  of ! electrons  in HF compounds  was  believed to  be temperature dependent  [3,  4]:  above  the  coherence  temperature  (T*), ! electrons  were  considered  localized,  while  below  T*,  they were  thought  to  hybridize  with  conduction  electrons,  form ing  delocalized,  heavy  quasiparticles.  Significant  progress has  been  made  in  recent  years,  both  experimentally,  such as  angle-resolved photoemission  spectroscopy  (ARPES)  [5- 14]  and ultrafast optical spectroscopy measurements [15-17], and  theoretically  [18,  19].  ARPES  studies  on  Ce- [5-10], Yb- [11,  12],  and  U-based  [13,  14]  HF  systems  have  chal lenged this conventional view.  These  studies reveal the pres ence of hybridization even at temperatures significantly above T*,  suggesting  a more nuanced picture of !-electron behav ior.  Furthermore, some ARPES  investigations have even sug gested the relocalization of !-electrons at lower temperatures [8-10,  14],  further  complicating  the  understanding  of these systems. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy experiments have pro-   vided  complementary  insights,  revealing  hybridization  fluc tuations in these materials before the establishment of heavy electron coherence.  This  results  in the formation  of an indi rect hybridization gap at T*  [15-17].  These intriguing obser vations  highlight  the  complex  nature  of !-electron behavior in HF materials and underscore the need for further investiga tion.  While significant progress has been made in understand ing hybridization dynamics in two- and three-dimensional HF systems,  the  role  of dimensionality  remains  an  open  ques tion.  It is  believed  that the  nature  of unconventional  super conductivity,  quantum  criticality,  and  non-Fermi  liquid  be havior  are  strongly  influenced  by  the  dimensionality  of the system.  Therefore,  exploring the effect of dimensionality on hybridization and the resulting emergent phenomena is crucial for a complete understanding of HF systems.   CeC02Gas,  a  recently  synthesized  quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D)  Kondo  lattice  compound,  presents  a  unique  op portunity  to  explore  the  interplay  of dimensionality  and  HF physics.  This  material  exhibits  a  quantum  critical  point  at ambient pressure [20], displaying significant anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility [20], resistivity [21], and optical spec tra [22].  The crystal structure, with Ce atoms forming chains along  the  c-axis  isolated by  C0Ga9  cages  [20,  23],  leads  to quasi-1D heavy electron Fermi surfaces, as predicted by first principles  calculations  [20].  Transport  measurements  reveal incoherent Kondo scattering with an onset temperature of TJP ~ 90-100  K  [21,  24,  25]  and  the  emergence  of Kondo  co herence  at  T*  ,:::;  20  K  [21,  24].  Notably,  coherence  is  ob served  only  when  the  current  is  applied  parallel  to  the  Ce chains [21, 24].  Furthermore, non-Fermi liquid behavior with a linear temperature dependence is  observed below 2 K,  per sisting  down  to  0.07  K  without  long-range  magnetic  order [20,  26].  Recent planar Hall effect (PHE) measurements fur-   ther  support  the  presence  of hybridization  dynamics  in  this material,  indicating  an  intermediate  regime  between  T*  and TJt,  where  hybridization  remains  short-ranged  and  noncol lective [25].  These findings establish CeC02Gas  as a rare ex ample of a quasi-ID Kondo lattice in the vicinity of a quantum critical point, offering a platform to investigate the role of re duced dimensionality in driving quantum criticality.   Ultrafast  optical  spectroscopy  offers  a  powerful  lens  for investigating  the  intricate  dynamics  of low-energy  electrons in correlated materials, including high-temperature supercon ductors [27-31] and HF systems [15-17, 32, 33].  By perturb ing these materials with ultrashort laser pulses, time-resolved measurements can effectively disentangle different degrees of freedom  based  on  their  characteristic  relaxation  timescales. This technique is particularly sensitive to subtle changes in the low-energy  electronic  structure  near the  Fermi  energy  (EF ), such  as  the  opening of a narrow  energy  gap.  Notably,  it en ables  the  study  of slow  relaxation processes  associated with the  bottleneck effect  in  HFs,  providing  crucial  insights  into the dynamics of hybridization [15-17, 32, 33].   In this paper, we report an ultrafast optical spectroscopy in vestigation of the CeCo2Ga8 single crystal, revealing a strong anisotropy  in  the  transient reflectivity  that is  consistent with its quasi-ID structure.  Analysis of the temperature-dependent relaxation dynamics indicates the presence of two distinct hy bridization gaps.  The first,  a  direct gap  of 2/1,i;r  f::,  50 me V, remains up to rt f::,  90 K,  well above the coherence temper ature  T*  f::,  20  K.  This  higher  temperature  gap  is  attributed to the onset of hybridization fluctuations.  A  second,  indirect gap of 2A;nd  f::,  10 meV emerges closer to  T*,  signifying the development of long-range coherence in the HF state.   High-quality single  crystals  of CeC02Gas  were grown us ing a Ga self-flux method [20].  Ultrafast pump-probe differ ential  reflectivity  (AR/R)  measurements  were performed us ing  a  1  MHz  Yb-based  femtosecond  laser  oscillator  with  a center wavelength of 800 nm(~ 1.55  eV)  and a pulse width of ~ 35  fs.  The  pump  and  probe  beam polarizations  were maintained orthogonal to each other.  For a probe beam per pendicular to  the c-axis  of the  sample,  it  is  referred to  as  s polarization, while for a parallel orientation, it is referred to as p-polarization.  To  minimize surface contamination,  all mea surements  were conducted on freshly  cleaved surfaces under high vacuum  (better than  10-6  mbar).  Further details  of the experimental setup can be found in Ref.  [27].   Figures  l(a)  and  l(b)  illustrate  the  transient  reflectivity (AR/R)  as  a  function  of time  delay  at  various  temperatures, measured withs-polarization and p-polarization, respectively. Upon photoexcitation, we observe a prompt change in reflec tivity for both orientations:  a decrease for s-polarization and an  increase  for  p-polarization.  This  initial  response  is  fol lowed by relaxation processes, gradually returning the system to equilibrium.  The relaxation is governed by intricate inter actions such as electron-electron and electron-phonon scatter ing.  The  photoinduced  transient  reflectivity  exhibits  a  pro nounced temperature dependence for both polarizations.  For s-polarization,  the  magnitude  of the initial rapid decay com ponent increases significantly with decreasing temperature.  In   contrast, for p-polarization, the initial positive transient reflec tivity is enhanced with decreasing temperature.  Furthermore, below approximately 90 K,  a fast component with a negative amplitude becomes increasingly prominent as the temperature decreases.  This low-temperature component exhibits a slower relaxation time and grows in amplitude with decreasing tem perature,  potentially  signaling  the  opening  of a  low-energy gap in the density of states  [17].  Figures  l(c) and  l(d) show the 2D pseudocolor map of AR/ R as a function of temperature and delay time, corresponding to Figs.  l(a) and  l(b), respec tively.  These plots provide a clearer visualization of the over all trends in the data,  making it easier to observe the changes in  amplitude  and  relaxation  time.  These  observations  high light  a complex interplay between temperature,  probe polar ization, and the underlying electronic structure, likely involv ing the material's quasi- ID Kondo lattice  and the hybridiza tion gap.   To  quantify  the  temperature-dependent behavior,  we  ana lyze the quasiparticle dynamics.  The solid black lines in Figs. l(a)  and  l(b) represent fits  to  the transient reflectivity  using the following function (See Supplemental Material [34]):   AR(t) ~ - - =H(er,t)[L.,A;exp(--)+C]   where  H (er, t)  represents  the  Heaviside  step  function  with an  effective  rise  time  er.  A;  and  'r;  are  the  amplitude  and relaxation  time  of  the  ith  decay  process,  respectively,  and   C  is  a  constant  offset.  To  ensure  consistency  in  compo nent  assignments  between  the  s- and  p-polarized  data,  we performed a four-exponential  fit  for  the  s-polarized photoin duced transient reflectivity,  with A1  constrained to zero.  This results  in  an  effective  three-exponential  decay  description l(a)].  For p across  the  measured  temperature  range  [Fig. polarization,  the  relaxation  dynamics  exhibit  a  temperature dependent  crossover.  Below  90  K,  a  three-exponential  de cay  function  is  required  for  accurate  fitting,  whereas  above 90 K, a two-exponential function  (with A2 = 0)  suffices  [Fig. l(b)](See Figs.  Sl and S2 in the Supplemental Material [34]). Figures  2(al) and 2(a2)  show the temperature dependence of the amplitude (A2)  and relaxation time ( -r2)  associated with the fast decay component for s-polarization, while Figs.  2(bl) and 2(b2) present the corresponding temperature dependence of A2 and  -r2 for  the  second decay component observed with p-polarization.  For  s-polarization,  both A2  and  -r2  increase rapidly with decreasing temperature below rt, showing a no table slope change rather than a sharp transition due to fitting uncertainties.  A significant anomaly around 30 K [Figs.  2(al) and  2(a2)]  suggests  a  possible  transition  near  this  tempera ture.  For  p-polarization,  the  amplitude  and  relaxation  time parameters  show  an  anomaly  around  rt ~ 90 K,  coinciding with the  onset of incoherent  Kondo  scattering  between con duction  electrons  and  localized !-moments  [20,  25].  Below rt, A2 increases rapidly and continues to grow with decreas ing  temperature,  without  any  obvious  anomalies  around  30 K.  This  contrast highlights  a  significant anisotropy  in  quasi particle  relaxation.  Similar intermediate-temperature behav ior has  been reported  in  other  strongly  correlated  materials, such as heavy fermions  [15-17, 35]  and high-temperature su perconductors  [27,  28],  often  attributed  to  the  formation  of hybridization gaps and pseudogaps, respectively.  Notably, for p-polarization,  A2 reaches  a  maximum  slightly  below  20  K before decreasing at lower temperatures, possibly due to elec tron redistribution caused by  anisotropic  hybridization,  war ranting further investigation.   The  temperature  dependence  of the  amplitude  and  relax ation time below rt can be described by the Rothwarf-Taylor (RT)  model  [36],  which  captures  the  time  evolution  of cou pled quasiparticles and bosons in the presence of a narrow en ergy gap (A)  in the electron density of states (DOS) near Ep. In this framework, excited quasiparticles with energy exceed ing the gap recombine,  releasing high-frequency bosons that can subsequently re-excite electron-hole pairs.  The RT model has  been  successfully  applied  to  various  correlated  systems [15-17, 27-31]. According to the RT model, the gap function can be  quantitatively  extracted from  the following  equations [31,  32]:   where nT  is the thermal quasiparticle density.  The parameter D  is a constant that depends exclusively only on the photoex-   citation intensity  [32].  The parameter p  (0 < p  < l) reflects the gapped DOS near the gap edge.   Due to the apparent anomaly around 30 Kins-polarization, we fit the high- and low-temperature data with the RT  model separately.  Fitting -r2 (r) and n} (r) above and below 30 K, us ing a temperature-independent constant gap A,  yields  energy gaps  of 2A.i;,  ~ 50  meV  and  2A;nd  ~ 14  meV,  respectively, with p  = 0.5 from a typical BCS-like DOS  [32].  We propose that the smaller energy gap,  A;nd,  is  an indirect hybridization gap  emerging  slightly  above  the  coherence  temperature  r• determined from transport measurements.  The larger energy gap,  Act;,,  is  a direct hybridization  gap that persists  up  to  90 K due  to  hybridization fluctuations,  a phenomenon observed by ARPES in other heavy fermion compounds well above r• and preceding the emergence of the fully opened indirect hy bridization  gap  at  r*,  characterized by band bending  [5-9]. As indicated by the solid cyan lines in Figs.  2(bl) and 2(b2), fitting  -r2(r) and n}(r) using a temperature-independent con stant gap A yields an energy gap of 2Adir ~ 52 me V,  also with p  = 0.5.  The observed difference in relaxation dynamics be tweens- and p- polarizations likely stems from the anisotropic electronic  structure caused by its  quasi-1 D  crystal  structure. This leads to anisotropic quasiparticle dynamics and uniaxial hybridization  in  CeC02Gas,  which  is  supported  by  infrared spectroscopy results that hybridization occurs predominantly along the c-axis [22].   Although ultrafast  spectroscopy lacks  the momentum res olution  of  ARPES,  it  can  still  reflect  the  anisotropy  of quasiparticle relaxation,  as  demonstrated in iron-based high temperature  superconductors  with nematic  fluctuations  [28]. The reflectivity  signal contains information about quasiparti-   cle  relaxation  in  different  momentum  space  directions.  For s-polarization,  the reflectivity  signal  is  more  sensitive  to  re laxation along the c-axis.  Conversely,  for p-polarization,  re laxation perpendicular to  the c-axis  contributes  more  signifi cantly.  Therefore, regardless of the polarization direction, the reflectivity can reflect hybridization information and provide the onset temperature rt of hybridization fluctuations.  How ever, for p-polarization, the reflectivity signal is less sensitive to  quasiparticle dynamics related to  c-axis hybridization,  ex plaining the absence of a clear anomaly around 30 K.   To  further  investigate  the  underlying  mechanism  of  hy bridization and its  dependence on excitation density,  we per formed pump fluence-dependence transient reflectivity exper iments for s-polarization,  as  shown in  Fig.  3(a).  The M/R signal exhibits a complex dependence on pump fluence,  with both the amplitude and the relaxation dynamics changing sig nificantly.  Figure  3(b)  presents  a  2D  pseudocolor  map  of M/R as  a  function  of pump-probe  delay  time  and  fluence, clearly illustrating this fluence  dependence.  Notably, the evo lution of the transient reflectivity with increasing fluence  dif fers  significantly from  that observed with increasing temper ature  [Fig.  l(a)],  highlighting  the  distinct  nature  of the  two excitation methods.  While increasing temperature results in a decrease in the initial reflectivity change, increasing pump flu ence results in a more pronounced initial reflectivity drop ac companied by increasingly strong secondary rising peak.  This suggests that the underlying mechanisms at play are different. The  transient  reflectivity  can  be  fitted  with  a  three exponential decay function across the entire measured fluence range,  allowing  us  to  extract  the  fluence  dependence  of the amplitudes.  Figure  3(c)  summarizes  the  fluence  dependence   of the amplitude  IA2I- At low fluence,  IA2I  grows monotoni cally with increasing fluence,  exhibiting  a near-linear depen dence up to F  ~ 60 µJlcm2 ,  as depicted by the black dashed line.  This  initial linear regime  suggests  a direct relationship between the number of excited quasi particles and the observed reflectivity change.  For HF compounds at low temperatures, the relationship between the amplitude A and pump fluence F has been proposed as  [33]:   where  c  is  a  fitting  parameter.  We  find  that  Eq.  (4)  accu rately describes the fluence dependence of IA2 I for fluences F :S  300 µJ/cm2 ,  as  shown by the  solid green line in 3(c). This agreement suggests that, in this  lower fluence regime, the ul trafast dynamics  are dominated by the physics  of the  Kondo effect.  As  the  fluence  increases,  the  observed  faster  relax ation, indicated by the narrowing of the initial negative peak, can be attributed to the gradual suppression of the hybridiza tion  gap[33].  As  the  fluence  increases,  a  larger  number  of quasiparticles are excited, effectively screening the local mo ments  and  reducing  the  hybridization  strength,  thus  leading to  a faster  decay.  This  characteristic fluence  of 300 µJ/cm2 , where we  observe  a deviation from the  prediction of the RT model,  can be  compared to  similar studies  on other HF sys tems,  although direct comparisons should be made with cau tion due to varying experimental conditions and definitions of this  characteristic  fluence.  For example,  CeAuSb2  has  been reported  to  have  a  similar characteristic  fluence  of approxi mately 200 µJ/cm2  at 3.8  K [17],  while CeAgSb2  exhibits  a change  in behavior  at  a  lower  fluence,  less  than  60  µJ/cm2 at 12 K  [35],  and YbB12  requires a higher fluence,  exceeding 0.4 mJ/cm2 [37].  These differences may reflect variations in the  strength  and robustness  of the  hybridization gap  in these materials.   However, beyond 300 µJ/cm2 , the behavior of IA2 I deviates from  the  prediction of Eq.  (4).  The  rate  of increase in  IA2I slows  down,  while  the  relaxation  dynamics  evolve,  charac terized by a more pronounced initial negative peak in the tran sient reflectivity signal, followed by a more distinct secondary rising peak.  This deviation indicates that the strong photoex - citation  in  this  higher  fluence  regime  leads  to  a  qualitative change in the  system's dynamics.  We  attribute this  to the in tense pumping effectively disentangling the hybridization be tween  the  conduction  and  4f bands,  resulting  in  the  smear ing  of the  hybridization  gap  or  even  a  photoinduced  phase transition [17, 33], along with the emergence of additional re laxation pathways.  This disentangling of the hybridization is consistent with the small indirect hybridization gap (li;nd)  ob served at low temperatures, which implies a weak hybridiza tion strength that is susceptible to strong photoexcitation. The observed changes  in the transient reflectivity profile,  includ ing the more pronounced negative peak and more pronounced secondary rising peak, suggest that these additional relaxation processes contribute significantly to the observed signal.  Fur ther investigation, possibly involving modeling of the excited state  dynamics,  would be needed to  fully  elucidate the com plex processes occurring in this high-fluence regime.   In conclusion,  we  report  an  ultrafast  optical  spectroscopy study of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice CeCo2Ga8. Our  measurements  reveal  strong  anisotropy  in  the  transient reflectivity,  reflecting the material's unique structure.  We ob serve  two  distinct  types  of hybridization  gaps:  a  direct  gap that persists up rt ;::; 90 K, associated with hybridization fluc tuations, and an indirect gap emerging at a lower temperature slightly  above  T*  ;::;  20  K,  where  coherent Kondo  screening develops.  Analysis of the temperature- and fluence-dependent relaxation  dynamics  using  the  Rothwarf-Taylor  model  pro vides quantitative estimates of these gaps, highlighting the in terplay of Kondo physics and low dimensionality in this  sys tem.  Our results  establish ultrafast optical spectroscopy as  a powerful tool for probing anisotropic hybridization and emer gent phenomena in heavy fermion materials.

         "Carbon plays key roles in the InterStellar Medium (ISM) -- as a constituent of dust, as the carrier of the dominant far-infrared cooling line, and as a component of various important molecules. But despite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared. We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus.

But\ndespite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse\nISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But\nfor carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the\nliterature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of\ncarbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 µm [Cii] line in the far-infrared. We\npresent a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources,\nand predict the [Cii] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA,\ntargeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC 342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of\nGalactic [Cii] absorption along the IC 342 sightline, although it requires disentangling [Cii] emission\nfrom IC 342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow\na detection. This SOFIA study informs the prospects for [Cii] absorption measurements with future\nfacilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR telescopes – PRIMA,\nFIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins – to detect [Cii] absorption. We find that all four facilities would be\nable to detect [Cii] absorption along a significant number of sightlines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nKeywords: Far-Infrared Astronomy (592) — Interstellar Line Absorption (843) — Interstellar Abun-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.3**\ndances (832) — Astronomical Techniques (1684) – Telescopes(1689)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n1. INTRODUCTION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIt is easy to argue that carbon is the most impor-\ntant metal in the InterStellar Medium (ISM). In the\ndust phase, carbonaceous grains make up one of the\ntwo main grain varieties (along with oxygen-rich sili-\ncates; B. T. Draine & A. Li 2001; A. P. Jones et al.\n2013). The mid-infrared emission of galaxies’ ISM is\ndominated by aromatic and aliphatic carbonaceous fea-\ntures (B. T. Draine et al. 2007; A. P. Jones et al. 2016;\nK. M. Sandstrom et al. 2012). At shorter wavelengths,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nCorresponding author: Christopher J. R. Clark\ncclark@stsci.edu\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncarbon plays a key role in dust extinction. For instance,\nthe prominent far-ultraviolet rise and 2175 ˚A bump ex-\ntinction features are believed to be due to carbonaceous\nspecies (B. T. Draine 2003; K. D. Gordon et al. 2003) –\nwith evidence that the species causing the far-ultraviolet\nextinction rise is closely linked to the formation and/or\nshielding of molecular hydrogen (D. Van De Putte et al.\n2023). Meanwhile, in the gas phase, the [Cii] 158 µm fine\nstructure transition is the primary cooling line for the\ncold ISM, thereby playing a key role in regulating star-\nformation (M. G. Wolfire et al. 2008; S. C. O. Glover\n& P. C. Clark 2014), and being a commonly-observed\nline for probing the star-forming ISM (C. L. Carilli &\nF. Walter 2013; K. V. Croxall et al. 2017; E. Tarantino\net al. 2021).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHowever, the fraction of carbon that is in the gas\nphase, compared to the fraction that is depleted into\ndust grains, is almost unconstrained. As with most met-\nals, the gas-phase abundance of carbon in the neutral\nISM is typically measured via UltraViolet (UV) absorp-\ntion features. But in the case of carbon (which pri-\nmarily exists as C+ in the ISM; P. F. Goldsmith et al.\n2012), the only available absorption features are either\nthe very weak intersystem Cii transition at 2325 ˚A, or\nthe extremely strong Cii transitions at 1036 and 1334 ˚A\n(D. C. Morton 2003). The weak 2325 ˚A feature requires\nformidable sensitivity and spectral resolution to even be\ndetected; and fitting the damping wings of the saturated\nmulti-component 1036 and 1334 ˚A features atop a com-\nplex stellar continuum is even more rarely attempted\n(U. J. Sofia et al. 2004, 2011).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs such, only 19 abundances for carbon in the cold\nISM have been published (U. J. Sofia et al. 2011 and\nreferences therein) – 13 from the 2325 ˚A weak intersys-\ntem transition, and 6 from the 1334 ˚A strong transition.\nMoreover, the abundances derived via the two methods\ndisagree severely. Along sightlines where abundances\nhave been estimated via both techniques, they differ by\na factor of 1.7 on average (with the differences between\nmeasurements ranging from a factor of 3.0 to a factor of\n1.1; U. J. Sofia et al. 2011).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nA consequence of this lack of certainty is that the\nfraction of carbon depleted onto dust, and especially\nhow this depletion varies with column density,\nis al-\nmost unknown. This is illustrated starkly by Figure 5\nof E. B. Jenkins (2009), where the depletion of carbon\nat a range of column densities (expressed via the ‘de-\npletion strength’ proxy) is plotted, with the depletion of\nseveral other key dust-constituting elements shown for\ncomparison.\nIn contrast with the other elements, the\nvariation of carbon depletion with column density is ef-\nfectively unquantified. As hydrogen column increases\nfrom 1019 cm−2 to 1021 cm−2, carbon depletion might\nincrease by a factor of 2.5, or it might be totally un-\nchanged – both are compatible with the existing data.\nMoreover, UV measurements of abundances – for all el-\nements, not just carbon – become effectively impossible\nfor sightlines with high column densities, due to inter-\nstellar extinction towards the OB stars used as back-\nground sources. This prevents us from measuring deple-\ntions in the highest-density environments, where com-\nplex chemical evolution is no doubt occurring.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nUnderstanding elemental depletions, and how they\nvary with density, is critical to studies of the ISM. De-\npletion strongly influences both the dust-to-gas ratio, a\nkey metric for understanding the chemical evolution of\ngalaxies (A. R´emy-Ruyer et al. 2014; J. Roman-Duval\net al. 2022), and how galaxies absorb and reprocess\nstarlight (S. Bianchi et al. 2018). Carbon is especially\ncentral to these questions, as not only is it the sec-\nond most abundant metal in the ISM, it is also notably\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nvolatile, meaning variation in its phase has the poten-\ntial to significantly affect the dust-to-gas ratio. This,\nin turn, dictates our view of the ‘dust budget crisis’,\nwherein the amount of dust in galaxies, especially at\nhigh redshift, can appear to outstrip known dust sources\n(K. Rowlands et al. 2014).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSeparate from this, there is also the ongoing ‘carbon\ncrisis’, arising from the fact that essentially all dust mod-\nels require a greater carbon abundance than what is ac-\ntually measured from young stellar photospheric abun-\ndances (S. Wang et al. 2015). A proposed solution to the\n‘carbon crisis’ is that photospheric carbon abundances\nunderestimate interstellar carbon abundances, due to\nuneven incorporation of different elements from the ISM\nin the star formation process – further reinforcing the\nimportance of accurately measuring the in situ abun-\ndance of interstellar carbon.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this paper, we present a previously-overlooked ap-\nproach for measuring the abundance and depletion of\ncarbon in the neutral ISM: specifically, the use of 158 µm\n[Cii] absorption. We present the results of a pilot study\nconducted with the Stratospheric Observatory For In-\nfrared Astronomy (SOFIA; P. Temi et al. 2018), and\nthe prospects for taking advantage of this method with\nfuture Far-InfraRed (FIR) telescopes. The Hubble Space\nTelescope, and its UV spectrometers, have a finite lifes-\npan, so we are therefore facing the prospect of losing the\nability to measure ISM metal abundances in the UV,\nuntil the successful launch of the Habitable Words Ob-\nservatory ( National Academies 2021). By providing an\nalternate way to measure the depletions of key elements,\nand to do so in high-extinction environments inaccessi-\nble in the UV, FIR absorption-line spectroscopy with a\nfuture FIR mission would be a highly valuable tool.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n2. METHOD\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the diffuse ISM, the vast majority of gas-phase car-\nbon resides in C+ (M. G. Wolfire et al. 2010; P. F. Gold-\nsmith et al. 2012; H. Beuther et al. 2014; J. L. Pineda\net al. 2017), with the transition to C0 occurring in a\nrelatively thin layer, surrounding the denser molecular\nphase (T. G. Bisbas et al. 2018; P. C. Clark et al. 2019).\nDespite being one of the most commonly-observed\nmetal cooling lines in emission, there have been very few\nobservations of 158 µm [Cii] in absorption (E. Falgarone\net al. 2010; U. U. Graf et al. 2012; J. Stutzki et al. 2013;\nM. Gerin et al. 2015; W. D. Langer et al. 2016; N. Nes-\nvadba et al. 2016; C. Guevara et al. 2020; S. Kabanovic\net al. 2022). Moreover, these observations have all been\nof absorption of [Cii] emission associated with regions\nof intense star formation, with emitting and absorbing\nmaterial in the same galaxy (usually the Milky Way).\nThis leads to very complex line profiles – even when the\nabsorbing C+ is not physically associated with the [Cii]\nemitting material, the two cannot be distinguished in\nvelocity space (W. D. Langer et al. 2016). As a result,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthe associated hydrogen column cannot be isolated with\nconfidence. This means that a clean determination of\nthe carbon abundance cannot be made.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n[Cii] Absorption and Excitation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn this work, we present the novel methodology of us-\ning FIR-bright background galaxies to detect foreground\n158 µm [Cii] absorption by the cold Galactic ISM. By ob-\nserving [Cii] absorption against the continuum of bright\nit should be possible to make a\nbackground sources,\nclean detection of the absorption profile, without the\nconfusion of self-absorption.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIt is important to note that only C+ atoms in the\nfine-structure ground state can cause [Cii] absorption.\nThis is significant, as the ground and excited states in\nthe [Cii] transition have a relatively modest energy sep-\naration of T ∗ = 92 K. We therefore need to consider\nthe fraction of C+ expected to be in the fine-structure\nground state, as described by the excitation tempera-\nture, Tex . The ratio of relative populations in the upper\nversus lower energy states, nu\n, is given by the Boltz-\nnl\nmann factor equation:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nwhere gu and gl are the statistical weights of the upper\nand lower states, being 4 and 2 respectively (P. F. Gold-\nsmith et al. 2012). The black line Figure 1 shows how\nthe proportion of C+ in the upper state therefore varies\nwith Tex .\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs shown in Equations 5 and 6 of M. Gerin et al.\n(2015), the [Cii] integrated line opacity,  τ[CII] dv, in\nthe diffuse ISM is given by:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nτ[CII] dv (km s−1) =\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nwhere NC+, l is the column density of C+ that is in the\nfine-structure ground state, in cm−2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs Tex increases, so too will the column density\nof C+ associated with a given integrated line opacity,\n τ[CII] dv (due to the increasing fraction of the C+ col-\numn not contributing to the [Cii] absorption); this effect\nis plotted with the red line in Figure 1.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs can be seen in Figure 1, [Cii] absorption is a near-\nperfect tracer of C+ column at Tex < 20 K, where the\nvast majority of C+ is in the ground state. Indeed, [Cii]\nremains a decent tracer of NC+ even up to Tex = 30 K,\nwhere > 91% of C+ is still in the ground state. Above\nthis point, however, it breaks down as an accurate probe\nof NC+ column.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nBeing able to use [Cii] absorption as a tool to trace the\nbulk carbon column depends upon the excitation tem-\nperature being < 30 K, and ideally < 25 K. As discussed\nin M. Gerin et al. (2015), Tex ≤ 25 K is expected for C+\nin the diffuse ISM.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFigure 1.

Guevara et al. (2020) use multi-tracer multi-\nisotopologue observations of [Cii] absorption for nu-\nmerous sightlines8 towards a number of Galactic star-\nforming regions, with an average excitation temperature\nof Tex = 26.8 K.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn similar observations of [Cii] absorption towards an-\nother Milky Way star-forming region, S. Kabanovic et al.\n(2022) use a comparable approach to infer excitation\ntemperatures of 14 < Tex < 30 K for the foreground\nC+, which their model finds to be associated with Hi\nand low-density H2. S. Kabanovic et al. (2022) also use\noptical extinction data to estimate the total ISM column\nalong their long of sight, and thence the total expected\nC column; from this, they infer that the vast majority\nof the C+ must be in the ground state, to account for\nthe observed [Cii] absorption.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nW. D. Langer et al. (2016) find strong [Cii] absorption\nin most of the 10 sightlines they observe towards the\ninner Galaxy, and were able to specifically ascribe one\nof the strongest absorption features to the ISM of the\nlocal arm. They report that the excitation temperature\nof the absorbing C+ must be ‘considerably lower’ than\nthe 40 ≲ Tex ≲ 50 K of the emitting material.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIt is noteworthy that the low excitation temperatures\nfound by W. D. Langer et al. (2016), C. Guevara et al.\n(2020), and S. Kabanovic et al. (2022) were despite their\nsightlines all being towards the Galactic plane – which\nshould, on average, have considerably higher excitation\ntemperatures than the diffuse ISM at higher Galactic\nlatitudes. This is due to the greater abundance of warm\nand ionized material at low Galactic latitude (P. F.\nGoldsmith et al. 2012; V. Ossenkopf et al. 2013; W. D.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n8 C. Guevara et al. (2020) report the absorbing foreground as dif-\nficult to model, as it exhibits significant variation over angular\nseparations as small as 30′′.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nLanger et al. 2014). Nonetheless, there has been rela-\ntively little study of the excitation of C+ in the general\nISM at any Galactic latitude. Future missions (such as\nthose described in Section 5) will be needed to confirm\nthat the bulk C+ in the diffuse ISM reliably has a low\nexcitation temperature.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIt is also important to note that J. G. Ingalls et al.\n(2011) use Spitzer observations of H2 rotational tran-\nsitions to find evidence for excess collisional excitation\nin high-latitude Galactic cirrus. Given the relatively low\nT ∗ = 92 K energy separation of the [Cii] transition, such\nexcitation action will increase the excitation tempera-\nture of the high-latitude C+. The excitation energy of\nthe H2 rotational transitions is greater than that of [Cii]\n(being >510 K), so a larger fraction C+ will likely be af-\nfected than H2. However, J. G. Ingalls et al. (2011) find\nthat only ≈2% of H2 in their sightlines is rotationally ex-\ncited, suggesting such collisional excitation only affects\na small fraction of the high-latitude ISM. Additionally,\nit seems reasonable to expect that the high-latitude C+\nshould, overall, still have a low excitation temperature.\nWith the advent of JWST, and its unparalleled access\nto IR H2 lines, there are good prospects for great im-\nprovement in our understanding of the energetics of the\ndiffuse ISM in the coming years.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWith [Cii] absorption providing a viable means to\nmeasure C+ column density, one can then use the Hi\nand H2 column densities (the measurement of which is\ndescribed in Section 2.2.2) along the sightline to deter-\nmine the gas-phase carbon abundance relative to hydro-\ngen. Comparing this to the total (gas phase plus dust\nphase) ISM carbon abundance, as measured from the\natmospheres of Galactic young stars (K. Lodders 2003),\nthereby provides a measure of the carbon depletion.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n2.2. Identifying Viable Sightlines\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe designed a pilot study to test the implementa-\ntion of the [Cii] absorption method using SOFIA. For\nthis study, we searched for extragalactic background\nsources with sufficiently bright FIR dust continuum\nemission, along sightlines that should have sufficiently\nstrong Galactic 158 µm [Cii] absorption, to be detectable\nby the upgraded German REceiver for Astronomy at\nTerahertz frequencies (upGREAT9; S. Heyminck et al.\n2012; C. Risacher et al. 2018). Later, in Section 5, we\nuse the same method for identifying viable sightlines for\nobservation with potential future facilities.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nBecause the concept of using FIR absorption lines to\nmeasure depletions is novel, the search process for find-\ning candidate sightlines contains some steps and consid-\nerations that may not be familiar to astronomers used\nto measuring abundances and depletions in the UV.

Not\nonly is the search process relevant to our SOFIA study\n(discussed fully in Section 3) – but we also consider the\nspecific methodology of the sightline identification pro-\ncess to be a useful research output in and of itself, along\nwith the full list of candidate sightlines, both of which\nwe intend to be of use to future investigators. We later\napply the method to various proposed future FIR facil-\nities in Section 5.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n2.2.1. Identifying Potential Background Sources\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo identify possible sightlines for observation, we\nstarted by performing a systematic analysis of every\nnearby (< 40 Mpc) galaxy observed using the 160 µm\nband of the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrom-\neter (PACS; A. Poglitsch et al. 2010) instrument aboard\nthe Herschel Space Observatory (G. L. Pilbratt et al.\n2010). The surface brightness measured in the Herschel-\nPACS 160 µm band provides an accurate indication of\nthe dust continuum available as a background source\nfor [Cii] absorption at 158 µm, and the 13–16′′ resolu-\ntion of Herschel-PACS at 160 µm is a close match to the\n15′′ resolution of SOFIA-upGREAT. For this analysis,\nwe used the Herschel-PACS data presented by C. J. R.\nClark et al. (2018), from the DustPedia10 survey (J. I.\nDavies et al. 2017), providing 160 µm observations of\n753 nearby galaxies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFor each map, we performed a rough background-\nsubtraction by finding the median surface brightness in\nthe map, and subtracting it11. For each galaxy, we found\nthe highest surface-brightness area located within 1′ of\nthe galaxy’s center. To estimate the surface brightness\nthat would be observed, we took the mean Herschel-\nPACS 160 µm surface brightness within a circular aper-\nture 20′′ in diameter. We opted for a 20′′ aperture, in\ncontrast to the 15′′ SOFIA beam, in order to make the\nsurface brightness estimate slightly conservative (given\nthe diluting influence of beam side-lobes, for instance),\nand to make the estimates also applicable to several\nproposed future FIR facilities (as described in depth in\nSection 5). We discard candidate sightlines where the\nSignal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) in this aperture is < 10; this\nleft 432 sightlines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2.2.2. Estimating Carbon Column Density\nMeasuring the C+ abundance along a given sightline\nrequires not only that the continuum be bright enough\nto be detected, but also that there is enough Galactic C+\nalong that sightline to create a [Cii] absorption feature\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n10 https://dustpedia.astro.noa.gr/\n11 In order to be a viable background source, a galaxy’s surface\nbrightness needs to be so bright that background subtraction\nis practically unnecessary (given how much brighter the source\nwill be compared to any possible background/foreground). We\ntherefore deemed it unnecessary to perform any more complex\nbackground subtraction than this median subtraction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthat is deep enough to be detected as well. Relatively\nweak absorption features can potentially be detected in\nmodest amounts of integration time, as long as the con-\ntinuum is sufficiently bright (and the instrumental base-\nline sufficiently stable).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo estimate the expected carbon column density along\neach candidate sightline, we first measured the column\ndensities of atomic and molecular hydrogen. To evaluate\nthe atomic hydrogen column density, NHI, we used the\nHi column density maps provided by the Hi4PI 21 cm\nsurvey ( HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016). To evaluate\nthe molecular hydrogen component, we used the all-sky\nGalactic CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) maps of Planck Collab-\noration et al. (2014a)12. For sightlines where CO(1-0)\nis detected in the Planck Collaboration et al. (2014a)\nmap, we calculated NH2, the column density of H2, using\nthe standard prescription:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nNH2 = 6.25 × 1019 ICO(1−0) αCO\n(3)\nassuming the standard galactic CO-to-H2 conversion of\nαCO = 3.2 M⊙ pc−2 K−1 km−1 s (D. Obreschkow & S.\nRawlings 2009; A. D. Bolatto et al. 2013).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor sightlines where CO(1-0) is not detected in the\nPlanck Collaboration et al.

Saintonge et al.\n2017), to calculate the H2 column density.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor sightlines where there was insufficient CO(2-1)\nfor Planck Collaboration et al. (2014a) to provide an\nintensity, we assumed that there was therefore negligi-\nble molecular gas present. The Planck Collaboration\net al. (2014a) CO(2-1) maps have Root Mean Squared\n(RMS) noise of 0.12 K km s−1, corresponding to a molec-\nular gas column density of 3.4 × 1019 cm−2. For com-\nparison, all of our candidate sightlines have Hi column\ndensities > 4.2 × 1020 cm−2. We can therefore rule out\nthe molecular gas being a considerable fraction of the\ntotal column for sightlines where CO(2-1) is undetected\nby Planck Collaboration et al. (2014a). This is doubly\ntrue given that sightlines with undetected CO will of\ncourse tend to be in parts of the sky with lower overall\ngas column density, and therefore where molecular gas\nfractions should be lowest anyway.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHaving found the total Hi plus H2 column densities\nalong our candidate sightlines, we calculated the ex-\npected column densities of carbon (the total, in both the\ngas and dust phases) by applying a Milky Way carbon\nabundance of 12 + log10[ C\nH ] = 8.47 (K.

This gives us\ngood confidence that these are sampling the diffuse ISM,\nand that therefore Equation 2 is applicable. We dis-\ncarded candidate sightlines with fmol > 0.2 from further\nconsideration, as these sightlines. This left 409 sight-\nlines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe 16′ resolution of Hi4PI atomic gas data is well-\nmatched to the 15′ resolution of the Planck molecular\ngas data. These are both of course at significantly lower\nresolution than the Herschel-PACS FIR data. However,\nas we have discarded sightlines with fmol > 0.2, we\nwill primarily be dealing with the diffuse ISM, which\ntends to vary more smoothly, over larger angular scales,\nwith power spectrum studies of Hi4PI showing much less\npower at smaller scales (S. Choudhuri et al. 2017). The\nlower resolution of the gas data will lead us to overesti-\nmate fmol for some candidate sightlines, and underesti-\nmate it for others; but, on average, should still provide\na representative sample.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2.2.3.

We therefore exclude sightlines where the\nbackground galaxy has a radial velocity in the range\n−100 < v < 100 kms−1 (as per the velocities in the\nDustPedia catalog, as presented in J. I. Davies et al.\n2017 and C. J. R. Clark et al. 2018), to ensure there\nwill be no overlap between the [Cii] velocities of the\nbackground galaxy and the Milky Way.

The Carbon Phase Along our Candidate Sightlines\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs mentioned at the beginning of Section 2, the vast\nmajority of gas-phase carbon exists as C+, with C0 typi-\ncally being found in a relatively thin shell around molec-\nular clouds, where carbon is then incorporated into CO.\nStudies of absorption by C0 in the UV find C0 column\ndensities spanning the range 1013.6–1014.9 cm−2 (E. B.\nJenkins & T. M. Tripp 2011). Even if we adopt the up-\nper end of this range, this still corresponds to < 2% of\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthe expected overall gas-phase carbon column for 70%\nof sightlines – with every sightline having < 5% of the\ngas-phase carbon in C0. We are therefore happy to treat\nC0 as a negligible portion of the carbon budget for our\ncandidate sightlines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIronically, it is challenging to use observations of CO\nemission to actually estimate the column density of CO\nmolecules along a given sightline – and hence the frac-\ntion of carbon locked up in CO. This is because the opti-\ncal depth of 12CO evolves dramatically from the diffuse\nto dense ISM (M. A. Gordon & W. B. Burton 1976).\nThe ratio of the intensity of CO emission to the actual\ncolumn density of CO, ICO\n, can therefore evolve by al-\nNCO\nmost two orders of magnitude (R. Shetty et al. 2011). In\nthe diffuse ISM, ICO\n≈ 1×10−15 K km s−1 cm2; whereas\nNCO\nin the dense ISM, ICO\n≈ 3 × 10−17 K km s−1 cm2 (E. B.\nNCO\nBurgh et al. 2007; H. S.

However, as noted at the end\nof Section 2.2.2 above, we have already rejected sight-\nlines with fmol > 0.2, and so should not be sampling\nthe dense ISM. If we instead apply the diffuse ISM ICO\nNCO\nvalue, then we find that < 0.2% of the carbon along all\nof our candidate sightlines should be locked up in CO\n(with a median fraction of 0.04%). We deem this to be\nentirely negligible.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo estimate the fraction of the carbon column ex-\npected to be in the gas phase (as opposed to the dust\nphase) for each sightline, we used the hydrogen column\ndensity to calculate the predicted depletion of carbon,\nδC, using the depletion strength relationship of E.

Determining the\ndepth of the corresponding absorption feature requires\nus to also estimate what the width of the feature will\nbe.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe velocity width of the [Cii] line is known to corre-\nlate with the width of the Hi line.

Langer et al.\n2014; B. Mookerjea et al. 2016; W. J. G. de Blok et al.\n2016), although there is significant variation. However,\nby discarding candidate sightlines with fmol > 0.2, we\nhave removed the molecular-dominated environs where\nthe correlations is at risk of being weakest.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo estimate the width of the [Cii] absorption feature\nfor each candidate sightline, we refer again to Hi data of\nthe HI4PI survey, by using their line width maps. These\nline width maps give the Hi velocity width, σHI, that\nwould be required to account for all detected emission\nat a given position, if all of that emission were asso-\nciated with a single Gaussian component. The HI4PI\ndata release13 describes this metric as follows: “This is\na highly robust statistic in the sense that it behaves well\nin the presence of noise or multiple components. It can\neasily miss subtleties in the line profile and has some\ndependence on spectral resolution”. As such, we con-\nsider this a suitable basis for estimating the width of\nthe [Cii] feature; whilst it will not be perfectly accurate,\nthe correspondence between the Hi and [Cii] features\nwill, of course, also not be perfect. We therefore esti-\nmate the velocity width of the [Cii] feature according to\nσC+ = σHI/1.5.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nBy combining this velocity width information with\nthe predicted integrated [Cii] line opacity, we can es-\ntimate the expected [Cii] absorption profile, and thus\nits peak opacity, τ (peak )\n.

We need to evaluate\nhow severe this contamination could be for each of our\nsightlines, and to the degree to which it will limit our\nability to measure [Cii] absorption.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIt is well established that the surface brightness of the\n[Cii] line and that of the FIR continuum are related.\nPrevious studies have consistently found that S[CII] ≤\nSFIR/200 (T. D´ıaz-Santos et al. 2013; J. R. Goicoechea\net al. 2015; J.

Note\nthat these are conversion factors to convert from Jy sr−1, not\nMJy sr−1; we give the conversion factors for Jy sr−1 here to\npreserve consistency with G. Helou et al.

This was nec-\nessary partly due to the much poorer resolution of IRAS\n(4.3′). However, this larger annulus would be necessary\nregardless, in order to avoid sampling the extended FIR\nemission of the discs of the target background galaxies.\nThe target background galaxies have optical semi major\naxes (using R25 values from the HyperLEDA database;\nD. Makarov et al. 2014) as large as 15′; our 20′–30′ annu-\nlus is therefore designed to adequately sample the typi-\ncal level of Galactic FIR emission towards each position,\nwithout being biased by the emission from the back-\nground source. We opt to use the same size annulus for\nall sources, for consistency.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nUsing the annular surface brightnesses, we calculated\nSFIR, then assumed S[CII] = SFIR/200, to provide a\nplausible worst-case scenario for the surface brightness\nof Galactic [Cii] emission we can expect.

To fully\nevaluate the expected level of contamination, we require\na width for the emission profile. For this, we assume\nthe same velocity width as assumed for the absorption\nprofile in Section 2.2.5. The population of C+ producing\n[Cii] emission along a given sightline will not necessarily\nbe exactly the same as the population absorbing, but\nthey should be similar, especially in the diffuse ISM we\nare concerned with.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo provide a basic reasonableness check of these IRAS-\nIRIS-based estimates of the contaminating [Cii] emis-\nsion, we compared them to estimates derived from ba-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nsic radiative transfer theory.

By manually testing a range of\nTex values, we find that the S[CII] estimates provided for\nour candidate sightlines by this equation match those we\nderive from the IRAS-IRIS SFIR, if we assume excitation\ntemperatures in the range 5 < Tex < 10. This agrees\nwith the T < 10 observed in [Cii] surveys of the diffuse\nMilky Way ISM (D. J. Fixsen et al. 1999; T. Velusamy\net al. 2010, 2012; see P. F.

In the left panel of Figure 2, we illustrate an\nexample of this by plotting the predicted emission and\nabsorption spectra for the sightline towards background\ngalaxy NGC 733115, where the Galactic [Cii] emission is\nexpected to be ≈11 times stronger than the absorption.\nFortunately, as indicated by the central and right pan-\nels of Figure 2, we can still make accurate measurements\nof the [Cii] absorption, even when the contaminating\nMilky Way [Cii] emission is much stronger: it simply re-\nquires a precise subtraction of the contaminating Galac-\ntic emission.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n2.3.1.

But to summarise here, we used IRAS-IRIS\n100 µm data to see how well we could estimate the level\nof ISM emission within a target aperture with diameter\nof 1 beam Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM), by us-\ning two sets sky apertures, located on opposite sides of\nthe target sightline. Each set of sky apertures spanned\n3 FWHM, with Nyquist sampling.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe used Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a form\nof probabilistic non-parametric interpolation, to predict\nthe emission level in the target aperture using the emis-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nsion measured in the sky apertures. For each of our\ntarget sightlines, we performed this test at 16 simulated\ntarget positions in the IRAS data, offset from the true\nsightline by 1◦. By comparing the predicted emission\nlevel to the actual measured emission level at the 16 sim-\nulated target positions around each sightline, we quan-\ntified the accuracy of the sky subtraction possible with\nIRAS data for each sightline.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWith 16 simulated target positions tested around ev-\nery one of our candidate sightlines, we had a total of\nover 6000 simulated sky subtractions. By comparing all\nof these, we found that it is possible to subtract the\nsky emission in IRAS-IRIS for a given sightline with a\nmedian error of only 1.3% using our GPR method (see\nFigure C3).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIRAS-IRIS 100 µm data have an angular resolution\nover 10 times worse than that of either SOFIA, or of\nany proposed future FIR facility that might observe [Cii]\nIRAS is therefore sampling variation\n(see Section 5).\nin the Galactic ISM at much larger scales than what\nwould be sampled by higher-resolution FIR telescopes –\nwhereas at smaller scales, the level of variation will tend\nto become correspondingly smaller. To account for this,\nwe performed additional simulations, also described in\nAppendix C. In these simulations, we repeated the emis-\nsion subtraction simulations described above, but for a\nwide range of angular scales, from 1 to 20 times the\nIRAS FWHM. This allowed us to model the relationship\nbetween aperture size, and the accuracy of the resulting\nsky subtraction. This test assumes that the relation-\nship between angular scale and variation will hold true\nto angular scales below what can be probed by IRAS.\nHowever, it has been well-established that Herschel ob-\nservations of Galactic cirrus show scale-invariant, fractal\ngeometry, down to the < 10′′ resolution of Herschel 16(V.\nOssenkopf-Okada & R. Stepanov 2019; A. Roy et al.\n2019; J. F. Robitaille et al. 2019). We can therefore rely\nupon structures, and how they vary, being independent\ndown to the angular scales we are interested in. With\nthese tests, we extrapolate that it should be possible to\nsubtract sky emission with uncertainty of only 0.33% at\nresolution ≤20′′ (see Figure C4).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAt such a high level of accuracy, we would expect to\nindeed be able to subtract Galactic [Cii] emission with\nsufficient precision to accurately retrieve [Cii] absorption\nfeatures that are many times fainter than the emission,\nin the manner illustrated in Figure 2. Assuming 0.33%\nuncertainty on the subtraction for a telescope with 20′′\nresolution, we would expect to be able to detect absorp-\ntion features at S/N > 5 as long as the strength of the\n[Cii] absorption feature is at least 5 × 0.33% = 1.65%\nthe strength of the Milky Way [Cii] emission; this cor-\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n15 The [Cii] absorption and emission features are assigned a cen-\ntral velocity equal to the weighted mean velocity of the Hi\nspectrum (which accounts for 80% of the Hi along this sight-\nline according to the HI4PI decomposition).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n16 Because Herschel data lacks sensitivity to emission on angular\nscales greater than tens of arcminutes, we cannot perform the\ntest from Appendix C directly on Herschel observations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nresponds to 144 of our candidate sightlines. Even as-\nsuming that the 1.65% threshold for S/N > 5 detection\nis optimistic, a threshold of 4% would still correspond\nto 66 candidate sightlines – a threshold exceeded by the\nmajority of all the sightlines observable by the proposed\nfuture facilities discussed in Section 5. Given the uncer-\ntainty on (and scope for improvement of) the accuracy\nof the [Cii] subtraction possible with proposed future\nfacilities, we only exclude sightlines for which the pre-\ndicted [Cii] absorption feature strength is <1.65% of the\npredicted [Cii] emission strength.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWhilst variation in Galactic dust emission structure\nat 100 µm will of course not be a perfect proxy for how\nGalactic [Cii] emission varies, we should nonetheless ex-\npect the different tracers of the diffuse ISM to have a\nclose correspondence, especially in terms of their spatial\nvariation ( Planck Collaboration et al. 2014b). More-\nover, we only used 1-dimensional information for our\nestimation and subtraction of sky emission in the sub-\ntractions we performed here. No doubt the fidelity of\nthe subtraction could be refined still further by using 2-\ndimensional measurements (ie, making sky observations\nin both the x and y directions).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n2.4.

SOFIA STUDY\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFollowing the process laid out in Section 2.2, we\nfound that there are only 5 background galaxies in\nthe sky with 158 µm continuum emission bright enough\nto be detected in a reasonable amount of time by\nSOFIA-upGREAT. Due to atmospheric absorption, and\nSOFIA’s relatively warm primary mirror, continuum\nemission has to be incredibly bright to be detectable by\nSOFIA-upGREAT in a practical amount of time, requir-\ning surface brightnesses of >5 gigajanskys per stera-\ndian. Although sensitive [Cii] observations of many local\ngalaxies were made by the Herschel-PACS spectrometer\n(eg, J. Sutter et al. 2019), that instrument only had ve-\nlocity resolution of 240 km s−1 (given spectral resolution\nof 1250 at 158µm), making it it unsuitable for this exper-\niment, due to excessive dilution of any [Cii] absorption\nfeatures.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n17 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nadd40f#ajadd40ft3\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFrustratingly, two of the background sources with\nsufficiently bright continuum emission for SOFIA-\nupGREAT, M 82 and NGC 253, lie at relatively high\nGalactic latitudes, and therefore there is too little Milky\nWay column for there to be a good chance of [Cii] ab-\nsorption being detectable in < 10 hours of integration\ntime per galaxy with SOFIA-upGREAT. That left 3\nsightlines where Galactic [Cii] absorption could be prac-\ntically detected against the continuum emission of the\nbackground source – IC 342, NGC 4945, and the Circi-\nnus Galaxy (ESO 97-G13, hereafter referred to simply as\nCircinus). We were awarded 11.4 hrs (5.6 hrs of integra-\ntion, plus overhead) of priority 3 time (ie, filler time) in\nSOFIA Cycle 9 to observe these sightlines, in program\nNo 09-0030. Properties of all three sightlines are given in\nTable 1. The target S/N ratio for the continuum along\neach sightline is calculated to be the S/N required to\ndetect the absorption feature at S/N ≥ 5. The specified\nvelocity resolution for each was designed to maximise\nability to detect absorption, given the velocity width\npredicted for that sightline according to the Hi profile.\nUltimately, only Circinus and IC 342 were observed;\nNGC4945 was not observed during our allocated cycles,\nwhich were the last cycles of SOFIA operations. Circi-\nnus was observed for the full 49 minutes of requested\nintegration, whilst IC 342 was observed for 77 minutes\nof integration (30% of the requested total). Circinus\nwas observed during a single flight in August 2021, dur-\ning SOFIA’s southern deployment. IC 342 was observed\nover the course of two flights in April 2022.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n3.1. General Observing Setup\nOur SOFIA-upGREAT [Cii] observations were made\nusing the instrument’s Low Frequency Array (LFA). The\nLFA is a 14 pixel array with two polarizations; each po-\nlarization subarray (horizontal and vertical) has 7 pixels\n– with a central pixel surrounded by 6 more pixels in a\nhexagonal pattern, each offset ∼ 30′′ from the central\npixel. We observed in dual-polarization mode; because\nthe horizontal and vertical polarization subarrays are\nco-spatial, we therefore effectively observed in a manner\nthat treated the LFA as a simple 7 pixel array. For our\nanalysis, we only used the central pixel of this array, as\nthe offsets of the 6 surrounding pixels are large enough\nthat they cannot sample the brightest central region of\nour target galaxies; meaning the 6 surrounding pixels\nhave no prospect of detecting [Cii] absorption.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nGiven how bright the background sources need to be\nfor continuum to be detectable by SOFIA-upGREAT,\nthe strength of the predicted [Cii] absorption was ex-\npected to be at a similar level to the contaminating\nMilky Way [Cii] emission for the sightlines targeted by\nthis program (in contrast to many of the candidate sight-\nlines presented in Section 2, where the emission will of-\nten be many times stronger than the absorption).

Initial Modeling of the IC 342 Spectrum\nThe contaminating [Cii] emission from IC 342 compli-\ncates the search for Milky Way [Cii] absorption in this\ndata. However, upon visual inspection, we noticed that\nthe [Cii] emission from IC 342 seems to be asymmetrical.\nSpecifically, it drops off more sharply at lower velocities\n– where any absorption from Galactic [Cii] would be\nexpected – than it does at higher velocities, where the\nemission profile appears near-perfectly Gaussian.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo test this, we fitted a simple model to the data,\nconsisting of a Gaussian emission profile for the [Cii]\nemission from IC 342, along with a flat emission compo-\nnent for the IC 342 dust continuum. The free parameters\nwere therefore: the dust continuum emission level, Tcont\n(in K); the mean velocity of the [Cii] emission Gaus-\nsian, µemit (in km s−1); the standard deviation of the\n[Cii] emission Gaussian, σemit (in km s−1); and the am-\nplitude of the [Cii] emission Gaussian, Aemit (in K). We\nassumed that the uncertainty on each data point was\ndriven by Gaussian noise, independent in each velocity\nbin, as charactarized by the RMS noise ςRMS .\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe performed a maximum-likelihood fit of this model\nto the data, where we excluded the Milky Way velocity\nrange from the fitting, so that the effect of any Galactic\n[Cii] absorption would not affect the modelled profile.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe maximum-likelihood best-fit parameters were:\nTcont = 0.152 K, µemit = 34.0 km s−1, σemit =\n29.3 km s−1, and Aemit = 1.52 K. This model is plot-\nted in Figure 3. Also shown in Figure 3 are the residu-\nals between this model and the data. Whilst the model\nis an excellent fit to the data outside the Milky Way\nvelocity range, there is a very strong negative residual\nfeature centered at ∼ 0 km s−1 – corresponding to the\nvelocity range at which the Galactic Hi emission peaks,\nand therefore exactly where we would expect to find any\n[Cii] absorption from the Milky Way ISM. This neg-\native residual feature is approximately Gaussian, and\nhas a maximum per-channel amplitude of −0.26 K, cor-\nresponding to 6.8 times the instrumental RMS.

However, it is also pos-\nsible that this feature is instead just caused by intrinsic\nasymmetry in the [Cii] emission from IC 342, due to ve-\nlocity structure that happens to align exactly with the\nvelocity at which we would expect Milky Way absorp-\ntion to occur.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo examine whether we should expect the [Cii] emis-\nsion to be intrinsically symmetric, we referred to CO(1-\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFigure 3.

The maximum-likelihood\nbest-fit parameters for the CO emission spectrum were:\nµemit = 34.3 km s−1, σemit = 23.4 km s−1, and Aemit =\n4.37 K; this model is plotted in Figure 4, along with the\nresiduals.

DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL DETECTION OF\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n[Cii] ABSORPTION\nOur SOFIA-upGREAT data for the IC 342 sightline\nis well fit by our model incorporating [Cii] emission and\ndust emission from IC 342, and [Cii] absorption from the\nintervening Milky Way ISM. It is possible that the ap-\nparent Milky Way absorption feature in the spectrum\nis simply due to intrinsic asymmetry in the velocity\nstructure of the [Cii] emission profile of the background\ngalaxy IC 342 itself. However, it would require us to be\nexceptionally unlucky for a circumstantial asymmetry to\nso closely replicate the properties of the [Cii] absorption\nfeature we were expecting – especially given the lack\nany of such asymmetry in the CO spectrum of the ex-\nact same region (as per Section 3.2.2). A model where\nthere are two Gaussian emission components (plus con-\ntinuum) does provide an acceptable fit to the data – al-\nthough the residuals for this alternative model are signif-\nicantly worse than those for our model with absorption.\nSpecically, our model with absorption has a χ2 = 41.2\nin the −100 < vLSR ≲ 150 km s−1 velocity range – as\ncompared to χ2 of 67.0 for a model with two emitting\nGaussian components and no absorption.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe do not believe that contamination from Milky Way\n[Cii] emission could be significantly affecting the ob-\nservations, or the model. The contribution of Galac-\ntic [Cii] emission should be well subtracted from our\ndata by SOFIA-upGREAT dual beam switching (see\nSection 3.2). As noted in Table 1, we predict that the\nMilky Way [Cii] emission towards this sightline should\nhave brightness corresponding to 92% of level of ab-\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n21 As the marginalized posteriors for all the parameters are ef-\nfectively symmetrical, we quote a single ± credible interval for\neach.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nsorption expected against the dust continuum emission\nfrom IC 342. This predicted contamination from Galac-\ntic [Cii] emission therefore corresponds to 20% of the\nIC 342 dust continuum level, which equates to 0.03 K –\nmuch smaller than the >4 K amplitude of the absorp-\ntion we measure against the [Cii] emission from IC 342.\nSo even if the SOFIA-upGREAT dual beam switching\nsomehow provided a very poor subtraction of the Galac-\ntic [Cii] emission, it would still be negligible in amplitude\ncompared to our apparent absorption feature.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe model has an integrated Galactic [Cii] line opac-\nity of  τ[CII] dv = 9.36 ± 2.38 km s−1 (uncertainty being\nthe 68.3% quantile range of integrated line opacities cal-\nculated from the MCMC posterior samples), making it\na S/N = 4 measurement. This value of  τ[CII] dv is 70%\nmore than our prediction (see Table 1); this corresponds\nto a 1.6 σ difference, given the uncertainty.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFollowing Equation 2, our MAP integrated line opac-\nity corresponds to a total C+ column density of (1.31 ±\n0.33) × 1018 cm−2. Assuming gas-phase carbon is pre-\ndominantly in C+ (see Section 2.2.4), the gas-phase car-\nH ] = 8.54+0.10\nbon abundance we measure is 12 + log10[ C\n−0.13.\nThe C+ column density we measure therefore exceeds\nthe total carbon column density we had predicted for\nthis sightline (of 1.14 × 1018 cm−2). On face value, this\nimplies that there is no carbon depletion along this sight-\nline; technically we measure carbon ‘enhancement’ (ie,\npositive depletion) of δC = 0.06+0.10\n−0.13 dex. However, the\nuncertainties on this measurement encompass zero, and\nindeed extend down to carbon depletion as strong as\nδC = −0.07 dex. In other words, this simply represents\na non-detection of carbon depletion for this sightline.\nOur predicted depletion of δC = −0.19 dex lies within\n2 σ of our measurement.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe note that our predictions of the expected total\ncarbon column density were based on the assumption\nthe metal abundances of the sightline match the Milky\nWay average, for which we adopted 12 + log10[ C\nH ] = 8.47\n(as per Section 2.2.2). But in practice, ISM metallicity\ncan vary significantly between sightlines. For instance,\nA. M. Ritchey et al. (2023) find metallicities spanning a\nrange of over 0.4 dex for a set of 84 sightlines (although\nmost do lie within 0.1 dex of Solar) – this is a large\nenough range that our high carbon column density for\nthe IC 342 sightline would lie within the expected varia-\ntion. We also note that different models predict different\ncarbon abundances. The B. S. Hensley & B. T. Draine\n(2020) dust model assumes a total interstellar carbon\nabundance of 12 + log10[ C\nH ] = 8.52, which is 0.04 dex\ngreater than the abundance we adopted; in this case,\nthe range of carbon depletions compatible with our mea-\nsurement would also be 0.04 dex greater.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo gauge how much variation in ISM metallicity we\nshould expect between sightlines, we note that IC 342\nis located at Galactic coordinates of l = 138.17◦, b =\n+10.58◦, just above the Perseus region of the Galactic\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nplane. The Perseus region contains many of the stan-\ndard OB star sightlines used for measuring the metallic-\nity of the intervening ISM. A. M. Ritchey et al. (2023)\nmeasure the ISM metallicity for 10 sightlines in this\narea22. For these sightlines A. M. Ritchey et al. (2023)\nfind metallicities spanning a 0.46 dex range for non-\nrefractory elements (ie, elements less susceptible to hav-\ning metallicity determinations affected by depletion),\nwith a standard deviation of 0.13 dex, and an aver-\nage per-sightline metallicity uncertainty of 0.09 dex (see\ntheir Table 5). This range of metallicities is greater than\nthe difference between the carbon column density we\nmeasure for the IC 342 sightline, and the Milky Way av-\nerage. It therefore seems plausible that this sightline is\nprobing a column with somewhat elevated metallicity,\ngiving rise to our larger-than-expected column density\nof carbon.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs already mentioned, it remains possible that the\napparent absorption feature is just due to an intrinsic\nasymmetry in the [Cii] emission profile of IC 342, that\nhappens, by conspicuous misfortune, to closely match\nour expected absorption feature. We therefore char-\nacterise this as a possible detection of Galactic [Cii]\nabsorption. Regardless, this result highlights that us-\ning [Cii] absorption to probe the Milky Way’s ISM is a\npractical technique in general – even in the disadvan-\ntageous situation where [Cii] emission from the back-\nground galaxy contaminates the data.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n4.1.

Except for sight-\nlines where the Galactic Hi exhibits a narrow single-\nfeatured profile, we cannot know exactly where any [Cii]\nabsorption features will be located, or how wide they\nwill be.

However, our SOFIA-upGREAT data for the\nIC 342 sightline demonstrate that observers should err\non the side of caution when considering the risk of [Cii]\nemission from the background galaxy contaminating the\nMilky Way velocity range. We do note, however, that\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n22 Towards the stars HD 12323, HD 13268, HD 13745, HD 14434,\nHD 15137, HD 23180, HD 24190, HD 24398, HD 24534, and\nHD 24912.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthe additional flux provided by the background [Cii]\nemission from IC 342 actually makes the Galactic [Cii]\nabsorption easier to detect, in an absolute sense. This\nis because a given τabs now has more photons to absorb\nthan it otherwise would, giving rise to a greater change\nin observed brightness, increasing the S/N of the absorp-\ntion. As such, if an observer believes they can accurately\nconstrain the expected [Cii] emission profile of the back-\nground galaxy, this might in fact be an advantageous\narrangement, from a pure S/N standpoint.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe third key lesson is that for [Cii] absorption to pro-\nvide strong constraints on carbon depletion, we need to\nbe able to first constrain the metallicity of the ISM along\nthe sightline being probed. For future facilities able to\ntarget large numbers of sightlines, it will be possible\nto use the average Milky Way ISM carbon abundance\nwhen probing relations involving many measurements\nacross the sky. Moreover, future optical–NIR integral\nfield spectroscopic projects the like Local Volume Map-\nper (N. Drory et al. 2024) will provide direct auroral-line\nISM metallicity measurements across huge swaths of sky,\nboth in and above the Galactic plane. This will allow\nfor much more accurate estimates of the ISM metallicity\nalong a given sightline (although the portion of the col-\numn from which such metallicities are measured won’t\nnecessarily match the integrated column being probed\nby [Cii] absorption).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n5.

Of course, in\nthis regime, the practicalities of instrumentation mean\nthat significantly more time than this would in fact be\nrequired – rather, these sightlines should be considered\nas requiring ‘arbitrarily short’ integration time, where\ntotal observing time in practice will be dictated by read\nnoise, overheads, etc.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe consider practically-observable peak opacity to be\nτ (peak )\n[CII] > 0.01.

The mission’s\nmain focus would be on efficient low-resolution spec-\ntroscopic mapping. However, the design also includes\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\na potential medium-resolution mode, the Far-Infrared\nEnhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS), with spec-\ntroscopic resolution of R = 4 400 at 158 µm, provid-\ning 68 km s−1 velocity resolution, with sensitivity allow-\ning 2 × 10−19 Wm−2 spectral features to be detected at\nS/N = 5 in 1 hr26.

As a consequence, the 68 km s−1 velocity resolution\nof PRIMA-FIRESS is 5 times wider than the median\npredicted FWHM of the [Cii] absorption in our candi-\ndate sightlines (with 98% of all candidate sightlines hav-\ning FWHM < 68 km s−1).

Not only does this mean that more integra-\ntion is required to achieve a detection, but also means\nthat observed τ (peak )\nis expected to be very low. It also\nraises the risk of ‘unresolved saturation’, where the set\nof pairs of column densities and linewidths that yield\nadequate fits to the absorption is highly degenerate.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe modest velocity resolution of PRIMA-FIRESS is\nthe most significant issue.

Whilst not an\nespecially large number, it would still be enough to al-\nmost double the 19 existing measurements of interstellar\ncarbon abundance in the literature, from the UV. Addi-\ntionally, a benefit of PRIMA-FIRESS is that the slit in\nBand 4 (which includes the 158 µm wavelength of [Cii])\nhas a length of 13′; therefore no dedicated sky obser-\nvations would need to be made, as >10 FWHM of sky\nsampling would be provided either side of a target cen-\ntered in the middle of the slit.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\n5.2.

Chin et al. 2024) is a mission\nconcept that was developed for for NASA’s astrophysics\nprobe solicitation, although it was not down-selected for\nthe final selection round. It would use a deployable pri-\nIt’s\nmary mirror to achieve a 14 m primary aperture.\nHigh Resolution Receiver (HiRX) would provide resolv-\ning power of R = 106–107, providing 0.3 km s−1 veloc-\nity resolution, with sensitivity allowing 5 × 10−19 Wm−2\nspectral features to be detected at S/N = 5 in 1 hr. The\n14 m primary mirror would be passively cooled by the\nsunshield, and would provide 2.8′′ resolution at 158 µm.\nThis 2.8′′ resolution dramatically exceeds the reso-\nlution of the Herschel-PACS data we have been us-\ning to estimate the continuum surface brightness of the\nbackground target background galaxies that would ob-\nserved by each telescope. Such estimates for SALTUS\nwould therefore be significantly overestimated, due to\nthe greatly reduced beam dilution of SALTUS versus\nHerschel-PACS. No FIR data exists with sufficient res-\nolution to allow us to reliably determine how much\nbrighter the central surface brightness of the background\ngalaxies would be at the SALTUS resolution. The dif-\nference would no doubt vary depending on the structure\nof the FIR-bright core of each galaxy. To be conserva-\ntive, we simply use the estimates based on the Herschel-\nPACS data, with the caveat that the resulting estimated\nintegration times for SALTUS are likely overestimated\na factor of several. We additionally assume that two sky\npointings, to either side of a target, would be required\nto constrain the Milky Way [Cii] emission towards the\na sightline.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nEven with the added conservativeness of our calcula-\ntions, we still find that SALTUS-HiRX would excel at\nmeasuring [Cii] absorption – we find that 96 of our can-\ndidate sightlines would be plausible targets.

M. Bradford et al. 2018) would have\nresolving power of R = 104.5 at 157.7 µm, providing\n10 km s−1 velocity resolution, with sensitivity allowing\n4 × 10−21 Wm−2 spectral features to be detected at\nS/N = 5 in 1 hr. We use the 20′′ slit of the Origins-OSS\nhigh-resolution mode to compute the surface brightness\nit would observe, based on the Herschel-PACS 160 µm\ndata. The 5.9 m primary mirror of Origins would give\nresolution of 6.7′′, 1.8 times better than that of Herschel-\nPACS; we therefore leave the Herschel-PACS maps at\ntheir native resolution, to provide conservative estimates\nof the surface brightnesses that Origins would observe.\nThe 20′′ slit of the Origins-OSS high-resolution mode\ntherefore samples 3 FWHM of sky; as such two sky\npointings, one either side of the target pointing, would\nprovide sky sampling that exactly replicates the sky sub-\ntraction arrangement discussed in Section 2.3.1 and Ap-\npendix C.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOrigins-OSS would also have an ultra-high-resolution\nmode. Whilst this would have significantly better ve-\nlocity resolution than the high-resolution mode (by a\nfactor of 7), it also has significantly poorer sensitivity\n(by a factor of 37). Moreover, the field-of-view of the\nultra-high-resolution mode would be only a single 6.7′′\nbeam, making it prohibitively time-expensive to conduct\nenough off pointings for accurate sky estimation. Fewer\nthan 10 of our candidate sightlines would be detectable\nby the ultra-high-resolution mode in under 10 hours of\nintegration time; all of these sightlines would be easily\ndetectable with the high-resolution mode\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWith the Origins-OSS high-resolution mode, we find\nthat 94 candidate sightlines fall in the plausible-target\nparameter space, plotted in Figure 8. As can be seen\nin that figure, the limiting factor for Origins-OSS is not\nintegration time, but rather the τ (peak )\nthat would be\nobserved. The 10 km s−1 velocity resolution of Origins-\nOSS high-resolution mode is wide enough that 71% of\ncandidate sightlines would be unresolved, therefore di-\nluting their observed τ (peak )\nIndeed, the exceptional\nsensitivity of Origins, driven by its 6 m class cooled mir-\nror, means that all 94 sightlines could notionally be ob-\nserved to S/N = 10 in a combined integration time of\nunder 1 hour.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n6.

We report a possible detection of [Cii]\nabsorption along the IC 342 sightline, although it re-\nquires disentangling [Cii] emission from IC 342 itself.\nWhilst the apparent Galactic [Cii] absorption has very\nhigh statistical significance, it is not impossible that the\napparent [Cii] absorption feature is instead caused by\nintrinsic structure in the velocity profile of the [Cii]\nemission from IC 342, which happens to be very pre-\ncisely mimicking expected appearance of Galactic [Cii]\nabsorption. In any event, the result demonstrates the\npracticality of the basic methodology.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAssuming that gas-phase carbon is predominated by\nC+, our measured [Cii] absorption corresponds to a gas-\nphase carbon abundance of 12+log10[ C\nH ] = 8.54.

         " Measuring Interstellar Carbon Abundance via 158 µm [Cii] Absorption with SOFIA – A Potential Detection, and Proof-of-Concept for Depletion Studies with Future Far-IR Facilities   ABSTRACT Carbon plays key roles in the InterStellar Medium (ISM) – as a constituent of dust, as the carrier of the dominant far-infrared cooling line, and as a component of various important molecules. But despite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 µm [Cii] line in the far-infrared. We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources, and predict the [Cii] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC 342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of Galactic [Cii] absorption along the IC 342 sightline, although it requires disentangling [Cii] emission from IC 342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA study informs the prospects for [Cii] absorption measurements with future facilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR telescopes – PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins – to detect [Cii] absorption. We find that all four facilities would be able to detect [Cii] absorption along a significant number of sightlines.   Keywords: Far-Infrared Astronomy (592) — Interstellar Line Absorption (843) — Interstellar Abun-   dances (832) — Astronomical Techniques (1684) – Telescopes(1689)   It is easy to argue that carbon is the most impor- tant metal in the InterStellar Medium (ISM). In the dust phase, carbonaceous grains make up one of the two main grain varieties (along with oxygen-rich sili- cates; B. T. Draine & A. Li 2001; A. P. Jones et al. 2013). The mid-infrared emission of galaxies’ ISM is dominated by aromatic and aliphatic carbonaceous fea- tures (B. T. Draine et al. 2007; A. P. Jones et al. 2016; K. M. Sandstrom et al. 2012). At shorter wavelengths,   carbon plays a key role in dust extinction. For instance, the prominent far-ultraviolet rise and 2175 ˚A bump ex- tinction features are believed to be due to carbonaceous species (B. T. Draine 2003; K. D. Gordon et al. 2003) – with evidence that the species causing the far-ultraviolet extinction rise is closely linked to the formation and/or shielding of molecular hydrogen (D. Van De Putte et al. 2023). Meanwhile, in the gas phase, the [Cii] 158 µm fine structure transition is the primary cooling line for the cold ISM, thereby playing a key role in regulating star- formation (M. G. Wolfire et al. 2008; S. C. O. Glover & P. C. Clark 2014), and being a commonly-observed line for probing the star-forming ISM (C. L. Carilli & F. Walter 2013; K. V. Croxall et al. 2017; E. Tarantino et al. 2021).   However, the fraction of carbon that is in the gas phase, compared to the fraction that is depleted into dust grains, is almost unconstrained. As with most met- als, the gas-phase abundance of carbon in the neutral ISM is typically measured via UltraViolet (UV) absorp- tion features. But in the case of carbon (which pri- marily exists as C+ in the ISM; P. F. Goldsmith et al. 2012), the only available absorption features are either the very weak intersystem Cii transition at 2325 ˚A, or the extremely strong Cii transitions at 1036 and 1334 ˚A (D. C. Morton 2003). The weak 2325 ˚A feature requires formidable sensitivity and spectral resolution to even be detected; and fitting the damping wings of the saturated multi-component 1036 and 1334 ˚A features atop a com- plex stellar continuum is even more rarely attempted (U. J. Sofia et al. 2004, 2011).   As such, only 19 abundances for carbon in the cold ISM have been published (U. J. Sofia et al. 2011 and references therein) – 13 from the 2325 ˚A weak intersys- tem transition, and 6 from the 1334 ˚A strong transition. Moreover, the abundances derived via the two methods disagree severely. Along sightlines where abundances have been estimated via both techniques, they differ by a factor of 1.7 on average (with the differences between measurements ranging from a factor of 3.0 to a factor of 1.1; U. J. Sofia et al. 2011).   A consequence of this lack of certainty is that the fraction of carbon depleted onto dust, and especially how this depletion varies with column density, is al- most unknown. This is illustrated starkly by Figure 5 of E. B. Jenkins (2009), where the depletion of carbon at a range of column densities (expressed via the ‘de- pletion strength’ proxy) is plotted, with the depletion of several other key dust-constituting elements shown for comparison. In contrast with the other elements, the variation of carbon depletion with column density is ef- fectively unquantified. As hydrogen column increases from 1019 cm−2 to 1021 cm−2, carbon depletion might increase by a factor of 2.5, or it might be totally un- changed – both are compatible with the existing data. Moreover, UV measurements of abundances – for all el- ements, not just carbon – become effectively impossible for sightlines with high column densities, due to inter- stellar extinction towards the OB stars used as back- ground sources. This prevents us from measuring deple- tions in the highest-density environments, where com- plex chemical evolution is no doubt occurring.   Understanding elemental depletions, and how they vary with density, is critical to studies of the ISM. De- pletion strongly influences both the dust-to-gas ratio, a key metric for understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies (A. R´emy-Ruyer et al. 2014; J. Roman-Duval et al. 2022), and how galaxies absorb and reprocess starlight (S. Bianchi et al. 2018). Carbon is especially central to these questions, as not only is it the sec- ond most abundant metal in the ISM, it is also notably   volatile, meaning variation in its phase has the poten- tial to significantly affect the dust-to-gas ratio. This, in turn, dictates our view of the ‘dust budget crisis’, wherein the amount of dust in galaxies, especially at high redshift, can appear to outstrip known dust sources (K. Rowlands et al. 2014).   Separate from this, there is also the ongoing ‘carbon crisis’, arising from the fact that essentially all dust mod- els require a greater carbon abundance than what is ac- tually measured from young stellar photospheric abun- dances (S. Wang et al. 2015). A proposed solution to the ‘carbon crisis’ is that photospheric carbon abundances underestimate interstellar carbon abundances, due to uneven incorporation of different elements from the ISM in the star formation process – further reinforcing the importance of accurately measuring the in situ abun- dance of interstellar carbon.   In this paper, we present a previously-overlooked ap- proach for measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the neutral ISM: specifically, the use of 158 µm [Cii] absorption. We present the results of a pilot study conducted with the Stratospheric Observatory For In- frared Astronomy (SOFIA; P. Temi et al. 2018), and the prospects for taking advantage of this method with future Far-InfraRed (FIR) telescopes. The Hubble Space Telescope, and its UV spectrometers, have a finite lifes- pan, so we are therefore facing the prospect of losing the ability to measure ISM metal abundances in the UV, until the successful launch of the Habitable Words Ob- servatory ( National Academies 2021). By providing an alternate way to measure the depletions of key elements, and to do so in high-extinction environments inaccessi- ble in the UV, FIR absorption-line spectroscopy with a future FIR mission would be a highly valuable tool.   In the diffuse ISM, the vast majority of gas-phase car- bon resides in C+ (M. G. Wolfire et al. 2010; P. F. Gold- smith et al. 2012; H. Beuther et al. 2014; J. L. Pineda et al. 2017), with the transition to C0 occurring in a relatively thin layer, surrounding the denser molecular phase (T. G. Bisbas et al. 2018; P. C. Clark et al. 2019). Despite being one of the most commonly-observed metal cooling lines in emission, there have been very few observations of 158 µm [Cii] in absorption (E. Falgarone et al. 2010; U. U. Graf et al. 2012; J. Stutzki et al. 2013; M. Gerin et al. 2015; W. D. Langer et al. 2016; N. Nes- vadba et al. 2016; C. Guevara et al. 2020; S. Kabanovic et al. 2022). Moreover, these observations have all been of absorption of [Cii] emission associated with regions of intense star formation, with emitting and absorbing material in the same galaxy (usually the Milky Way). This leads to very complex line profiles – even when the absorbing C+ is not physically associated with the [Cii] emitting material, the two cannot be distinguished in velocity space (W. D. Langer et al. 2016). As a result,   the associated hydrogen column cannot be isolated with confidence. This means that a clean determination of the carbon abundance cannot be made.   [Cii] Absorption and Excitation   In this work, we present the novel methodology of us- ing FIR-bright background galaxies to detect foreground 158 µm [Cii] absorption by the cold Galactic ISM. By ob- serving [Cii] absorption against the continuum of bright it should be possible to make a background sources, clean detection of the absorption profile, without the confusion of self-absorption.   It is important to note that only C+ atoms in the fine-structure ground state can cause [Cii] absorption. This is significant, as the ground and excited states in the [Cii] transition have a relatively modest energy sep- aration of T ∗ = 92 K. We therefore need to consider the fraction of C+ expected to be in the fine-structure ground state, as described by the excitation tempera- ture, Tex . The ratio of relative populations in the upper versus lower energy states, nu , is given by the Boltz- nl mann factor equation:   where gu and gl are the statistical weights of the upper and lower states, being 4 and 2 respectively (P. F. Gold- smith et al. 2012). The black line Figure 1 shows how the proportion of C+ in the upper state therefore varies with Tex .   As shown in Equations 5 and 6 of M. Gerin et al. (2015), the [Cii] integrated line opacity,  τ[CII] dv, in the diffuse ISM is given by:   τ[CII] dv (km s−1) =   where NC+, l is the column density of C+ that is in the fine-structure ground state, in cm−2.   As Tex increases, so too will the column density of C+ associated with a given integrated line opacity,  τ[CII] dv (due to the increasing fraction of the C+ col- umn not contributing to the [Cii] absorption); this effect is plotted with the red line in Figure 1.   As can be seen in Figure 1, [Cii] absorption is a near- perfect tracer of C+ column at Tex < 20 K, where the vast majority of C+ is in the ground state. Indeed, [Cii] remains a decent tracer of NC+ even up to Tex = 30 K, where > 91% of C+ is still in the ground state. Above this point, however, it breaks down as an accurate probe of NC+ column.   Being able to use [Cii] absorption as a tool to trace the bulk carbon column depends upon the excitation tem- perature being < 30 K, and ideally < 25 K. As discussed in M. Gerin et al. (2015), Tex ≤ 25 K is expected for C+ in the diffuse ISM.   C. Guevara et al. (2020) use multi-tracer multi- isotopologue observations of [Cii] absorption for nu- merous sightlines8 towards a number of Galactic star- forming regions, with an average excitation temperature of Tex = 26.8 K.   In similar observations of [Cii] absorption towards an- other Milky Way star-forming region, S. Kabanovic et al. (2022) use a comparable approach to infer excitation temperatures of 14 < Tex < 30 K for the foreground C+, which their model finds to be associated with Hi and low-density H2. S. Kabanovic et al. (2022) also use optical extinction data to estimate the total ISM column along their long of sight, and thence the total expected C column; from this, they infer that the vast majority of the C+ must be in the ground state, to account for the observed [Cii] absorption.   W. D. Langer et al. (2016) find strong [Cii] absorption in most of the 10 sightlines they observe towards the inner Galaxy, and were able to specifically ascribe one of the strongest absorption features to the ISM of the local arm. They report that the excitation temperature of the absorbing C+ must be ‘considerably lower’ than the 40 ≲ Tex ≲ 50 K of the emitting material.   It is noteworthy that the low excitation temperatures found by W. D. Langer et al. (2016), C. Guevara et al. (2020), and S. Kabanovic et al. (2022) were despite their sightlines all being towards the Galactic plane – which should, on average, have considerably higher excitation temperatures than the diffuse ISM at higher Galactic latitudes. This is due to the greater abundance of warm and ionized material at low Galactic latitude (P. F. Goldsmith et al. 2012; V. Ossenkopf et al. 2013; W. D.   Langer et al. 2014). Nonetheless, there has been rela- tively little study of the excitation of C+ in the general ISM at any Galactic latitude. Future missions (such as those described in Section 5) will be needed to confirm that the bulk C+ in the diffuse ISM reliably has a low excitation temperature.   It is also important to note that J. G. Ingalls et al. (2011) use Spitzer observations of H2 rotational tran- sitions to find evidence for excess collisional excitation in high-latitude Galactic cirrus. Given the relatively low T ∗ = 92 K energy separation of the [Cii] transition, such excitation action will increase the excitation tempera- ture of the high-latitude C+. The excitation energy of the H2 rotational transitions is greater than that of [Cii] (being >510 K), so a larger fraction C+ will likely be af- fected than H2. However, J. G. Ingalls et al. (2011) find that only ≈2% of H2 in their sightlines is rotationally ex- cited, suggesting such collisional excitation only affects a small fraction of the high-latitude ISM. Additionally, it seems reasonable to expect that the high-latitude C+ should, overall, still have a low excitation temperature. With the advent of JWST, and its unparalleled access to IR H2 lines, there are good prospects for great im- provement in our understanding of the energetics of the diffuse ISM in the coming years.   With [Cii] absorption providing a viable means to measure C+ column density, one can then use the Hi and H2 column densities (the measurement of which is described in Section 2.2.2) along the sightline to deter- mine the gas-phase carbon abundance relative to hydro- gen. Comparing this to the total (gas phase plus dust phase) ISM carbon abundance, as measured from the atmospheres of Galactic young stars (K. Lodders 2003), thereby provides a measure of the carbon depletion.   We designed a pilot study to test the implementa- tion of the [Cii] absorption method using SOFIA. For this study, we searched for extragalactic background sources with sufficiently bright FIR dust continuum emission, along sightlines that should have sufficiently strong Galactic 158 µm [Cii] absorption, to be detectable by the upgraded German REceiver for Astronomy at Terahertz frequencies (upGREAT9; S. Heyminck et al. 2012; C. Risacher et al. 2018). Later, in Section 5, we use the same method for identifying viable sightlines for observation with potential future facilities.   Because the concept of using FIR absorption lines to measure depletions is novel, the search process for find- ing candidate sightlines contains some steps and consid- erations that may not be familiar to astronomers used to measuring abundances and depletions in the UV. We   therefore lay out the search process in detail here. Not only is the search process relevant to our SOFIA study (discussed fully in Section 3) – but we also consider the specific methodology of the sightline identification pro- cess to be a useful research output in and of itself, along with the full list of candidate sightlines, both of which we intend to be of use to future investigators. We later apply the method to various proposed future FIR facil- ities in Section 5.   To identify possible sightlines for observation, we started by performing a systematic analysis of every nearby (< 40 Mpc) galaxy observed using the 160 µm band of the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrom- eter (PACS; A. Poglitsch et al. 2010) instrument aboard the Herschel Space Observatory (G. L. Pilbratt et al. 2010). The surface brightness measured in the Herschel- PACS 160 µm band provides an accurate indication of the dust continuum available as a background source for [Cii] absorption at 158 µm, and the 13–16′′ resolu- tion of Herschel-PACS at 160 µm is a close match to the 15′′ resolution of SOFIA-upGREAT. For this analysis, we used the Herschel-PACS data presented by C. J. R. Clark et al. (2018), from the DustPedia10 survey (J. I. Davies et al. 2017), providing 160 µm observations of 753 nearby galaxies.   For each map, we performed a rough background- subtraction by finding the median surface brightness in the map, and subtracting it11. For each galaxy, we found the highest surface-brightness area located within 1′ of the galaxy’s center. To estimate the surface brightness that would be observed, we took the mean Herschel- PACS 160 µm surface brightness within a circular aper- ture 20′′ in diameter. We opted for a 20′′ aperture, in contrast to the 15′′ SOFIA beam, in order to make the surface brightness estimate slightly conservative (given the diluting influence of beam side-lobes, for instance), and to make the estimates also applicable to several proposed future FIR facilities (as described in depth in Section 5). We discard candidate sightlines where the Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) in this aperture is < 10; this left 432 sightlines.   2.2.2. Estimating Carbon Column Density Measuring the C+ abundance along a given sightline requires not only that the continuum be bright enough to be detected, but also that there is enough Galactic C+ along that sightline to create a [Cii] absorption feature   that is deep enough to be detected as well. Relatively weak absorption features can potentially be detected in modest amounts of integration time, as long as the con- tinuum is sufficiently bright (and the instrumental base- line sufficiently stable).   To estimate the expected carbon column density along each candidate sightline, we first measured the column densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen. To evaluate the atomic hydrogen column density, NHI, we used the Hi column density maps provided by the Hi4PI 21 cm survey ( HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016). To evaluate the molecular hydrogen component, we used the all-sky Galactic CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) maps of Planck Collab- oration et al. (2014a)12. For sightlines where CO(1-0) is detected in the Planck Collaboration et al. (2014a) map, we calculated NH2, the column density of H2, using the standard prescription:   NH2 = 6.25 × 1019 ICO(1−0) αCO (3) assuming the standard galactic CO-to-H2 conversion of αCO = 3.2 M⊙ pc−2 K−1 km−1 s (D. Obreschkow & S. Rawlings 2009; A. D. Bolatto et al. 2013).   For sightlines where CO(1-0) is not detected in the Planck Collaboration et al. (2014a) map, we instead used their CO(2-1) map, and applied a ICO(2−1) line ratio ICO(1−0) of r2:1 = 0.7 (A. K. Leroy et al. 2013; A. Saintonge et al. 2017), to calculate the H2 column density.   For sightlines where there was insufficient CO(2-1) for Planck Collaboration et al. (2014a) to provide an intensity, we assumed that there was therefore negligi- ble molecular gas present. The Planck Collaboration et al. (2014a) CO(2-1) maps have Root Mean Squared (RMS) noise of 0.12 K km s−1, corresponding to a molec- ular gas column density of 3.4 × 1019 cm−2. For com- parison, all of our candidate sightlines have Hi column densities > 4.2 × 1020 cm−2. We can therefore rule out the molecular gas being a considerable fraction of the total column for sightlines where CO(2-1) is undetected by Planck Collaboration et al. (2014a). This is doubly true given that sightlines with undetected CO will of course tend to be in parts of the sky with lower overall gas column density, and therefore where molecular gas fractions should be lowest anyway.   Having found the total Hi plus H2 column densities along our candidate sightlines, we calculated the ex- pected column densities of carbon (the total, in both the gas and dust phases) by applying a Milky Way carbon abundance of 12 + log10[ C H ] = 8.47 (K. Lodders 2003; E. B. Jenkins 2009).   Equation 2 only applies to [Cii] in the diffuse ISM (as per Section 2.1). To check if our candidate sightlines are indeed sampling the diffuse ISM, we calculated the molecular gas fraction, fmol , for each, according to:   ΣH2 ΣHI + ΣH2   where ΣH2 and ΣHI are the mass surface densities of Hi and H2, respectively.   We found fmol < 0.2 for 95% of our candidate sight- lines, and fmol < 0.1 for 71% of them. This gives us good confidence that these are sampling the diffuse ISM, and that therefore Equation 2 is applicable. We dis- carded candidate sightlines with fmol > 0.2 from further consideration, as these sightlines. This left 409 sight- lines.   The 16′ resolution of Hi4PI atomic gas data is well- matched to the 15′ resolution of the Planck molecular gas data. These are both of course at significantly lower resolution than the Herschel-PACS FIR data. However, as we have discarded sightlines with fmol > 0.2, we will primarily be dealing with the diffuse ISM, which tends to vary more smoothly, over larger angular scales, with power spectrum studies of Hi4PI showing much less power at smaller scales (S. Choudhuri et al. 2017). The lower resolution of the gas data will lead us to overesti- mate fmol for some candidate sightlines, and underesti- mate it for others; but, on average, should still provide a representative sample.   As further examined in Section 3.2,   [Cii] emission from the background galaxy can contaminate the ve- locity range where Milky Way [Cii] absorption is ex- pected, compromising our ability to measure any [Cii] absorption. We therefore exclude sightlines where the background galaxy has a radial velocity in the range −100 < v < 100 kms−1 (as per the velocities in the DustPedia catalog, as presented in J. I. Davies et al. 2017 and C. J. R. Clark et al. 2018), to ensure there will be no overlap between the [Cii] velocities of the background galaxy and the Milky Way. This left 402 sightlines.   Note that we imposed this criterion based on the results of our SOFIA observations of IC 342 (see Sec- tion 3.2), which has a velocity of ≈ 35 km s−1. Therefore IC 342 does not appear in our final catalog of candidate sightlines, despite being targeted by the SOFIA program discussed later in this paper.   As mentioned at the beginning of Section 2, the vast majority of gas-phase carbon exists as C+, with C0 typi- cally being found in a relatively thin shell around molec- ular clouds, where carbon is then incorporated into CO. Studies of absorption by C0 in the UV find C0 column densities spanning the range 1013.6–1014.9 cm−2 (E. B. Jenkins & T. M. Tripp 2011). Even if we adopt the up- per end of this range, this still corresponds to < 2% of   the expected overall gas-phase carbon column for 70% of sightlines – with every sightline having < 5% of the gas-phase carbon in C0. We are therefore happy to treat C0 as a negligible portion of the carbon budget for our candidate sightlines.   Ironically, it is challenging to use observations of CO emission to actually estimate the column density of CO molecules along a given sightline – and hence the frac- tion of carbon locked up in CO. This is because the opti- cal depth of 12CO evolves dramatically from the diffuse to dense ISM (M. A. Gordon & W. B. Burton 1976). The ratio of the intensity of CO emission to the actual column density of CO, ICO , can therefore evolve by al- NCO most two orders of magnitude (R. Shetty et al. 2011). In the diffuse ISM, ICO ≈ 1×10−15 K km s−1 cm2; whereas NCO in the dense ISM, ICO ≈ 3 × 10−17 K km s−1 cm2 (E. B. NCO Burgh et al. 2007; H. S. Liszt et al. 2010).   Taking the dense ISM ICO NCO   value as a worst-case- scenario, we find that only < 3.9% of the carbon would be locked up in CO, for all our candidate sightlines (with a median fraction of 1.1%). However, as noted at the end of Section 2.2.2 above, we have already rejected sight- lines with fmol > 0.2, and so should not be sampling the dense ISM. If we instead apply the diffuse ISM ICO NCO value, then we find that < 0.2% of the carbon along all of our candidate sightlines should be locked up in CO (with a median fraction of 0.04%). We deem this to be entirely negligible.   To estimate the fraction of the carbon column ex- pected to be in the gas phase (as opposed to the dust phase) for each sightline, we used the hydrogen column density to calculate the predicted depletion of carbon, δC, using the depletion strength relationship of E. B. Jenkins (2009) (see also J. Roman-Duval et al. (2022)), which for carbon they find to be:   where the depletion strength parameter, F∗, is defined as per E. B. Jenkins (2009), to be a function of hydrogen column density, NH (in cm−2), such that:   F∗ = (0.299 × log(NH)) − 5.708   Having predicted the carbon column density for each of our candidate sightlines, and calculated the fraction of that carbon expected to be in the gas phase, and con- firmed that that gas phase carbon should be dominated by [Cii], we can now estimate the integrated [Cii] line opacity,  τ[CII] dv, using Equation 2. Determining the depth of the corresponding absorption feature requires us to also estimate what the width of the feature will be.   The velocity width of the [Cii] line is known to corre- late with the width of the Hi line. Specifically, [Cii] gen-   erally tends to have a narrower velocity than Hi, by an average factor of approximately 1.5 (W. D. Langer et al. 2014; B. Mookerjea et al. 2016; W. J. G. de Blok et al. 2016), although there is significant variation. However, by discarding candidate sightlines with fmol > 0.2, we have removed the molecular-dominated environs where the correlations is at risk of being weakest.   To estimate the width of the [Cii] absorption feature for each candidate sightline, we refer again to Hi data of the HI4PI survey, by using their line width maps. These line width maps give the Hi velocity width, σHI, that would be required to account for all detected emission at a given position, if all of that emission were asso- ciated with a single Gaussian component. The HI4PI data release13 describes this metric as follows: “This is a highly robust statistic in the sense that it behaves well in the presence of noise or multiple components. It can easily miss subtleties in the line profile and has some dependence on spectral resolution”. As such, we con- sider this a suitable basis for estimating the width of the [Cii] feature; whilst it will not be perfectly accurate, the correspondence between the Hi and [Cii] features will, of course, also not be perfect. We therefore esti- mate the velocity width of the [Cii] feature according to σC+ = σHI/1.5.   By combining this velocity width information with the predicted integrated [Cii] line opacity, we can es- timate the expected [Cii] absorption profile, and thus its peak opacity, τ (peak ) . This can be done substituting into a Gaussian absorption profile and the underlying continuum into Equation 2. Specifically, a Gaussian ab- sorption profile with mean velocity µabs in km s−1, and standard deviation σabs in km s−1, along with absorbing continuum emission with brightness temperature T (cont) b in K. Via this substitution, NC+ is related to τ (peak ) [CII] by:   (7) At the velocity where peak absorption occurs, τ (peak ) is related to the observed brightness temperature ac- cording to:   where and T (peak ) velocity of maximum absorption.   is the brightness temperature at the   2.3. Contamination from Milky Way [Cii] Emission Any observations of the 158 µm [Cii] spectra of our candidate sightlines not only have the potential of show- ing Milky Way [Cii] absorption, but also contamination from Milky Way [Cii] emission. We need to evaluate how severe this contamination could be for each of our sightlines, and to the degree to which it will limit our ability to measure [Cii] absorption.   It is well established that the surface brightness of the [Cii] line and that of the FIR continuum are related. Previous studies have consistently found that S[CII] ≤ SFIR/200 (T. D´ıaz-Santos et al. 2013; J. R. Goicoechea et al. 2015; J. Sutter et al. 2019), with SFIR defined as:   SFIR = 1.26 (S60 + S100)   where S60 and S100 are irradiance per solid angle ob- served by the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS; G. Neugebauer et al. 1984) in the 60 µm and 100 µm bands, in W m−2 sr−1, as per G. Helou et al. (1988)14. We can therefore use this relationship to assess the maximum likely level of Galactic [Cii] emission at a given position. IRAS-IRIS maps of M.-A. Miville- Deschˆenes et al. (2005), we created 1◦ × 1◦ cutouts cen- tred on each candidate sightline, at 60 and 100 µm. We then measured the median surface brightness in each band, within an annulus with inner and outer radii of 20′ and 30′, respectively. This means the Galactic emis-   Using the   sion is being sampled over a much larger area than the Herschel-PACS beam, inevitably averaging over some degree of variation in surface brightness. This was nec- essary partly due to the much poorer resolution of IRAS (4.3′). However, this larger annulus would be necessary regardless, in order to avoid sampling the extended FIR emission of the discs of the target background galaxies. The target background galaxies have optical semi major axes (using R25 values from the HyperLEDA database; D. Makarov et al. 2014) as large as 15′; our 20′–30′ annu- lus is therefore designed to adequately sample the typi- cal level of Galactic FIR emission towards each position, without being biased by the emission from the back- ground source. We opt to use the same size annulus for all sources, for consistency.   Using the annular surface brightnesses, we calculated SFIR, then assumed S[CII] = SFIR/200, to provide a plausible worst-case scenario for the surface brightness of Galactic [Cii] emission we can expect. We then cal- culated the corresponding flux density we would observe within our assumed 20′′ diameter aperture (as per Sec- tion 2.2.1).   The level of [Cii] emission predicted using the SFIR relationship is the integrated [Cii] emission. To fully evaluate the expected level of contamination, we require a width for the emission profile. For this, we assume the same velocity width as assumed for the absorption profile in Section 2.2.5. The population of C+ producing [Cii] emission along a given sightline will not necessarily be exactly the same as the population absorbing, but they should be similar, especially in the diffuse ISM we are concerned with.   To provide a basic reasonableness check of these IRAS- IRIS-based estimates of the contaminating [Cii] emis- sion, we compared them to estimates derived from ba-   sic radiative transfer theory. Specifically, given our es- timated [Cii] optical depth, τ[CII], for each candidate sightline, the surface brightness of the corresponding [Cii] emission should be given by:   S[CII] = B(λ[CII], Tex ) 1 − e−τ[CII] where B(λ[CII], Tex ) is the Planck function evaluated at λ[CII], the 157.7 µm [Cii] line wavelength, for an excita- tion temperature Tex . By manually testing a range of Tex values, we find that the S[CII] estimates provided for our candidate sightlines by this equation match those we derive from the IRAS-IRIS SFIR, if we assume excitation temperatures in the range 5 < Tex < 10. This agrees with the T < 10 observed in [Cii] surveys of the diffuse Milky Way ISM (D. J. Fixsen et al. 1999; T. Velusamy et al. 2010, 2012; see P. F. Goldsmith et al. 2012 for further examples), indicating that our estimates of the contaminating Milky Way [Cii] emission are sensible.   With our predicted intensities and velocity widths for the contaminating Milky Way [Cii] emission along each candidate sightline, we can estimate how it compares to the expected levels of absorption. For the vast ma- jority of the candidate sightlines, the Milky Way [Cii] emission is predicted to be stronger than the absorption feature. In the left panel of Figure 2, we illustrate an example of this by plotting the predicted emission and absorption spectra for the sightline towards background galaxy NGC 733115, where the Galactic [Cii] emission is expected to be ≈11 times stronger than the absorption. Fortunately, as indicated by the central and right pan- els of Figure 2, we can still make accurate measurements of the [Cii] absorption, even when the contaminating Milky Way [Cii] emission is much stronger: it simply re- quires a precise subtraction of the contaminating Galac- tic emission.   In order to assess the level of accuracy and precision we can reasonably expect for subtraction of the Galac- tic [Cii] emission, we performed simulations using IRAS data. These simulations are described in detail in Ap- pendix C. But to summarise here, we used IRAS-IRIS 100 µm data to see how well we could estimate the level of ISM emission within a target aperture with diameter of 1 beam Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM), by us- ing two sets sky apertures, located on opposite sides of the target sightline. Each set of sky apertures spanned 3 FWHM, with Nyquist sampling.   We used Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a form of probabilistic non-parametric interpolation, to predict the emission level in the target aperture using the emis-   sion measured in the sky apertures. For each of our target sightlines, we performed this test at 16 simulated target positions in the IRAS data, offset from the true sightline by 1◦. By comparing the predicted emission level to the actual measured emission level at the 16 sim- ulated target positions around each sightline, we quan- tified the accuracy of the sky subtraction possible with IRAS data for each sightline.   With 16 simulated target positions tested around ev- ery one of our candidate sightlines, we had a total of over 6000 simulated sky subtractions. By comparing all of these, we found that it is possible to subtract the sky emission in IRAS-IRIS for a given sightline with a median error of only 1.3% using our GPR method (see Figure C3).   IRAS-IRIS 100 µm data have an angular resolution over 10 times worse than that of either SOFIA, or of any proposed future FIR facility that might observe [Cii] IRAS is therefore sampling variation (see Section 5). in the Galactic ISM at much larger scales than what would be sampled by higher-resolution FIR telescopes – whereas at smaller scales, the level of variation will tend to become correspondingly smaller. To account for this, we performed additional simulations, also described in Appendix C. In these simulations, we repeated the emis- sion subtraction simulations described above, but for a wide range of angular scales, from 1 to 20 times the IRAS FWHM. This allowed us to model the relationship between aperture size, and the accuracy of the resulting sky subtraction. This test assumes that the relation- ship between angular scale and variation will hold true to angular scales below what can be probed by IRAS. However, it has been well-established that Herschel ob- servations of Galactic cirrus show scale-invariant, fractal geometry, down to the < 10′′ resolution of Herschel 16(V. Ossenkopf-Okada & R. Stepanov 2019; A. Roy et al. 2019; J. F. Robitaille et al. 2019). We can therefore rely upon structures, and how they vary, being independent down to the angular scales we are interested in. With these tests, we extrapolate that it should be possible to subtract sky emission with uncertainty of only 0.33% at resolution ≤20′′ (see Figure C4).   At such a high level of accuracy, we would expect to indeed be able to subtract Galactic [Cii] emission with sufficient precision to accurately retrieve [Cii] absorption features that are many times fainter than the emission, in the manner illustrated in Figure 2. Assuming 0.33% uncertainty on the subtraction for a telescope with 20′′ resolution, we would expect to be able to detect absorp- tion features at S/N > 5 as long as the strength of the [Cii] absorption feature is at least 5 × 0.33% = 1.65% the strength of the Milky Way [Cii] emission; this cor-   responds to 144 of our candidate sightlines. Even as- suming that the 1.65% threshold for S/N > 5 detection is optimistic, a threshold of 4% would still correspond to 66 candidate sightlines – a threshold exceeded by the majority of all the sightlines observable by the proposed future facilities discussed in Section 5. Given the uncer- tainty on (and scope for improvement of) the accuracy of the [Cii] subtraction possible with proposed future facilities, we only exclude sightlines for which the pre- dicted [Cii] absorption feature strength is <1.65% of the predicted [Cii] emission strength.   Whilst variation in Galactic dust emission structure at 100 µm will of course not be a perfect proxy for how Galactic [Cii] emission varies, we should nonetheless ex- pect the different tracers of the diffuse ISM to have a close correspondence, especially in terms of their spatial variation ( Planck Collaboration et al. 2014b). More- over, we only used 1-dimensional information for our estimation and subtraction of sky emission in the sub- tractions we performed here. No doubt the fidelity of the subtraction could be refined still further by using 2- dimensional measurements (ie, making sky observations in both the x and y directions).   2.4. Catalog of Sightlines   The catalog of candidate sightlines is provided in Ap- pendix D, Table D1, and available online in machine- readable format17. The catalog provides all the relevant properties of each sightline, such as position, continuum brightness, and measured NH – along with the predicted carbon properties, such as NC, τ (peak ) , and σCII . The catalog also includes the predicted integration times to detect [Cii] absorption for the sightlines with various proposed future facilities, as described in Section 5.   Following the process laid out in Section 2.2, we found that there are only 5 background galaxies in the sky with 158 µm continuum emission bright enough to be detected in a reasonable amount of time by SOFIA-upGREAT. Due to atmospheric absorption, and SOFIA’s relatively warm primary mirror, continuum emission has to be incredibly bright to be detectable by SOFIA-upGREAT in a practical amount of time, requir- ing surface brightnesses of >5 gigajanskys per stera- dian. Although sensitive [Cii] observations of many local galaxies were made by the Herschel-PACS spectrometer (eg, J. Sutter et al. 2019), that instrument only had ve- locity resolution of 240 km s−1 (given spectral resolution of 1250 at 158µm), making it it unsuitable for this exper- iment, due to excessive dilution of any [Cii] absorption features.   Frustratingly, two of the background sources with sufficiently bright continuum emission for SOFIA- upGREAT, M 82 and NGC 253, lie at relatively high Galactic latitudes, and therefore there is too little Milky Way column for there to be a good chance of [Cii] ab- sorption being detectable in < 10 hours of integration time per galaxy with SOFIA-upGREAT. That left 3 sightlines where Galactic [Cii] absorption could be prac- tically detected against the continuum emission of the background source – IC 342, NGC 4945, and the Circi- nus Galaxy (ESO 97-G13, hereafter referred to simply as Circinus). We were awarded 11.4 hrs (5.6 hrs of integra- tion, plus overhead) of priority 3 time (ie, filler time) in SOFIA Cycle 9 to observe these sightlines, in program No 09-0030. Properties of all three sightlines are given in Table 1. The target S/N ratio for the continuum along each sightline is calculated to be the S/N required to detect the absorption feature at S/N ≥ 5. The specified velocity resolution for each was designed to maximise ability to detect absorption, given the velocity width predicted for that sightline according to the Hi profile. Ultimately, only Circinus and IC 342 were observed; NGC4945 was not observed during our allocated cycles, which were the last cycles of SOFIA operations. Circi- nus was observed for the full 49 minutes of requested integration, whilst IC 342 was observed for 77 minutes of integration (30% of the requested total). Circinus was observed during a single flight in August 2021, dur- ing SOFIA’s southern deployment. IC 342 was observed over the course of two flights in April 2022.   3.1. General Observing Setup Our SOFIA-upGREAT [Cii] observations were made using the instrument’s Low Frequency Array (LFA). The LFA is a 14 pixel array with two polarizations; each po- larization subarray (horizontal and vertical) has 7 pixels – with a central pixel surrounded by 6 more pixels in a hexagonal pattern, each offset ∼ 30′′ from the central pixel. We observed in dual-polarization mode; because the horizontal and vertical polarization subarrays are co-spatial, we therefore effectively observed in a manner that treated the LFA as a simple 7 pixel array. For our analysis, we only used the central pixel of this array, as the offsets of the 6 surrounding pixels are large enough that they cannot sample the brightest central region of our target galaxies; meaning the 6 surrounding pixels have no prospect of detecting [Cii] absorption.   Given how bright the background sources need to be for continuum to be detectable by SOFIA-upGREAT, the strength of the predicted [Cii] absorption was ex- pected to be at a similar level to the contaminating Milky Way [Cii] emission for the sightlines targeted by this program (in contrast to many of the candidate sight- lines presented in Section 2, where the emission will of- ten be many times stronger than the absorption). We were therefore confident that the sky subtraction pro-   vided by the ‘off’ pointings would do an effective first- order job of removing any Galactic [Cii] emission (in the same manner as it subtracts atmospheric sky bright- ness).   We used the standard data products delivered by the observatory team, with the exception that no zeroth- order baseline subtraction was applied (as this would subtract the dust continuum). For each sightline, our specified velocity resolution was set to be the narrowest binning within which we could detect the continuum at our target S/N (as per Table 1) with Nyquist sampling. Main-beam brightness temperatures, Tb, were converted from observed antenna temperatures, T ∗ A, using the SOFIA-upGREAT main beam efficiency of ηMB = 0.97, according to Tb = T ∗ A/ηMB , as per the SOFIA Cycle 10 Observer’s Handbook18.   We were unable to achieve a detection with our Circi- nus observations, due to a strongly-varying instrumental baseline. A full description of the Circinus data is given in Appendix A. Our observations of IC 342, however, provided good-quality data.   Based on our experience with Circinus, our IC 342 ob- servations were conducted in dual beam-switching mode on the advice of our support scientist, in an attempt to provide a more stable baseline. The maximum 5′ throw of the chopping mirror used for beam-switching is small enough that the background positions lie within the FIR   emitting disc of IC 342. However, the average surface brightness of IC 342 at this radius is a factor of ≈ 100 lower than at its center, so this should not meaning- fully contaminate the quality of the background mea- surements. Dual beam-switching mode operates with two background positions, located on opposite sides of the source position. Our background positions were located with 5′ throw, at position angles of 105◦ and 285◦ counter-clockwise from the direction of positive right ascension. We used a on-off chopping frequency of 0.625 Hz.   We expect the Galactic [Cii] emission along the Circi- nus sightline to be 92% as strong as [Cii] absorption versus the continuum. Therefore, as long as the sky subtraction provided by the off position is accurate to within 22%, then the absorption feature would still be detectable with uncertainty of <20% (ie, with S/N>5). As our throw positions were again specifically chosen to be at locations where the level of Galactic emission is a good match to the apparent level in the direction of the sightline itself, we should comfortably exceed this requirement.   The data has RMS noise of ςRMS = 20 mK, measured in the velocity ranges −175 < vLSR < −100 km s−1 and 125 < vLSR < 15 km s−1 (chosen to sample only feature- less portions of the spectrum). Our observed spectrum for the IC 342 sightline is plotted in Figure 3. Also plot- ted is the HI4PI Hi spectrum. The Milky Way Hi ve- locity range is highlighted; there is also a low level of Hi emission +20 ≲ vLSR ≲ +120 km s−1 that arises from IC 342.   Our 157.7 µm spectrum for the IC 342 sightline con- tains clear dust continuum emission. However, the spec-   3.2.1. Initial Modeling of the IC 342 Spectrum The contaminating [Cii] emission from IC 342 compli- cates the search for Milky Way [Cii] absorption in this data. However, upon visual inspection, we noticed that the [Cii] emission from IC 342 seems to be asymmetrical. Specifically, it drops off more sharply at lower velocities – where any absorption from Galactic [Cii] would be expected – than it does at higher velocities, where the emission profile appears near-perfectly Gaussian.   To test this, we fitted a simple model to the data, consisting of a Gaussian emission profile for the [Cii] emission from IC 342, along with a flat emission compo- nent for the IC 342 dust continuum. The free parameters were therefore: the dust continuum emission level, Tcont (in K); the mean velocity of the [Cii] emission Gaus- sian, µemit (in km s−1); the standard deviation of the [Cii] emission Gaussian, σemit (in km s−1); and the am- plitude of the [Cii] emission Gaussian, Aemit (in K). We assumed that the uncertainty on each data point was driven by Gaussian noise, independent in each velocity bin, as charactarized by the RMS noise ςRMS .   We performed a maximum-likelihood fit of this model to the data, where we excluded the Milky Way velocity range from the fitting, so that the effect of any Galactic [Cii] absorption would not affect the modelled profile.   The maximum-likelihood best-fit parameters were: Tcont = 0.152 K, µemit = 34.0 km s−1, σemit = 29.3 km s−1, and Aemit = 1.52 K. This model is plot- ted in Figure 3. Also shown in Figure 3 are the residu- als between this model and the data. Whilst the model is an excellent fit to the data outside the Milky Way velocity range, there is a very strong negative residual feature centered at ∼ 0 km s−1 – corresponding to the velocity range at which the Galactic Hi emission peaks, and therefore exactly where we would expect to find any [Cii] absorption from the Milky Way ISM. This neg- ative residual feature is approximately Gaussian, and has a maximum per-channel amplitude of −0.26 K, cor- responding to 6.8 times the instrumental RMS. Inte- grated within the −50 < vLSR < +15 km s−1 velocity range, the negative residual feature has a strength of −4.49 ± 0.68 K km s−1   3.2.2. Comparing to IC 342 CO Emission The significant asymmetry in the [Cii] emission from IC 342 is what would be expected to arise from absorp- tion by Milky Way C+ along the sightline – assuming the underlying IC 342 [Cii] emission spectrum is intrin- sically Gaussian and symmetric. However, it is also pos- sible that this feature is instead just caused by intrinsic asymmetry in the [Cii] emission from IC 342, due to ve- locity structure that happens to align exactly with the velocity at which we would expect Milky Way absorp- tion to occur.   To examine whether we should expect the [Cii] emis- sion to be intrinsically symmetric, we referred to CO(1-   trum also contains [Cii] emission from IC 342. This [Cii] emission extends to lower velocities than we had anticipated based on previous SOFIA observations by M. R¨ollig et al. (2012) of two locations in IC 342. The discrepancy might be accounted for by the fact the M. R¨ollig et al. (2012) observations were much shallower than our own19, and were of positions offset a few arc- seconds from our target sightline. As a result of the [Cii] emission extending to lower velocities than expected, it overlaps the velocity range where we would expect Galactic [Cii] absorption.   Notwithstanding the [Cii] emission, the dust contin- uum emission from IC 342 is well-detected and stable. The continuum surface brightness is 152 mK20, which given the 20 mK RMS is therefore detected with per- channel S/N = 7.6. This is brighter than the 78 mK continuum level we estimated based the Herschel-PACS 160 µm surface brightness. However, as described in Section 2.2.1, this estimate was intentionally conserva- tive, and was based upon the average 160 µm surface- brightness within a 20′′ aperture, which is larger (hence more diluting) than the 15′′ SOFIA beam.   0) observations of IC 342 presented by M. Querejeta et al. (2023), which combine observations from the NOEMA interferometer and the IRAM 30 m telescope. The 5 m s−1 velocity resolution of their CO data is a good match to that of our [Cii] data, and the ≤4′′ an- gular resolution significantly exceeds that of SOFIA.   We convolved the M. Querejeta et al. (2023) CO data cube to match the 15′′ FWHM of SOFIA at 157.7 µm. We then extracted the CO spectra within a 15′′-wide aperture centered at the coordinates of our SOFIA- upGREAT [Cii] spectrum. The resulting CO spectrum should therefore be capturing emission from the same part of IC 342 as our [Cii] spectrum. The resulting CO spectrum is plotted in Figure 4.   Following the same process as for our [Cii] data, we fit a Gaussian model to the CO spectrum, only fitting to velocities outside the Milky Way velocity range (and omitting the dust continuum component, which will not be detectable in the CO data). The maximum-likelihood best-fit parameters for the CO emission spectrum were: µemit = 34.3 km s−1, σemit = 23.4 km s−1, and Aemit = 4.37 K; this model is plotted in Figure 4, along with the residuals. Unlike with our [Cii] data, the CO emission is very well fit by a Gaussian model, with no significant residuals or evidence of asymmetry.   Molecular gas dominates over atomic in the centers of spiral galaxies, so we should expect CO to be tracing the bulk of the gas (F. Bigiel et al. 2008; A. Schruba et al. 2011). The fact that the CO emission in the center of IC 342 shows no sign of asymmetry makes it more likely the [Cii] emission, in the exact same aperture, should   also be intrinsically symmetric. This supports the pos- sibility that the negative residual feature in Figure 3 is due to absorption from Milky Way C+ along the line of sight.   That said, the CO will not be tracing the exact same gas in IC 342 as the [Cii] emission. The CO should be tracing denser environs than the [Cii] (M. G. Wolfire et al. 2010). This is borne out by the data – whilst the [Cii] and CO have almost-identical central velocities, their velocity widths differ by 5.9 kms−1. As such, the well-behaved Gaussian symmetry of the CO emission does not guarantee that the same should be expected of the [Cii] emission.   To further explore the very suggestive negative resid- ual feature in Figure 3, we switch to a more robust mod- eling approach. We construct a model consisting of a flat dust continuum emission component from IC 342, a Gaussian [Cii] emission component from IC 342, and a Gaussian [Cii] absorption component from the Milky Way ISM. This results in 7 parameters; the 4 emission parameters used in the initial model in Section 3.2.1 above, along with: the mean velocity of the [Cii] absorp- tion Gaussian, µabs (in km s−1); the standard deviation of the [Cii] absorption Gaussian, σabs (in km s−1); and the peak opacity of the [Cii] absorption Gaussian, τ (peak )   (ie, the opacity at µabs ). We provide a formal descrip- tion of the model’s likelihood function in Appendix B   The wide and multi-featured Hi profile for the IC 342 sightline means that there is a broad range of plausi- ble values for the parameters describing any Milky Way [Cii] absorption feature. The absorption parameters will likely also have covariance with the parameters describ- ing the emission from IC 342. Moreover, there is the risk of there being multiple distinct combinations of param-   eters that are goods fits to the data. It is impractical to fully sample such a large, 7-dimensional parameter space via Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approaches.   Therefore, we started by performing a full brute-force grid evaluation of this 7-dimensional parameter space. The grid parameter ranges and step sizes are given in Table 2. For the absorption parameters, we opted to sample very wide ranges, encompassing the full range of values that were even remotely plausible, doing so with relatively narrow grid steps.   For µabs (in km s−1), our grid covers the full Milky Way velocity range. For σabs , our grid encompasses val- ues as narrow as our velocity binning, up to as wide as 45 km s−1 (which corresponds to a FWHM larger than the full Milky Way velocity range). For τ (peak ) , our grid range covers values from 0, all the way to 1.5 (which is 6 times greater than the peak opacity we estimated for this sightline; see Table 1). The emission parameters did not require such an extremely wide sampling, as they are reasonably well-constrained by the data in velocity ranges where no absorption is expected; however we still defined grid ranges that extended well above and below the best-fit values found in Section 3.2.1. The result- ing 7-dimensional parameter grid contains 584 330 600 models.   The posterior probability distribution of computed from the brute-force evaluation of our model grid is plotted in Figure 5. As can be seen, there is a single, constrained mode in the posterior. This demonstrates that the posterior does not exhibit multiple complex modes, or other pathologies. Having established this,   we could then refine our modeling by exploring the high- probability region of the posterior via MCMC sampling. Specifically, we used the emcee software package for Python (D. Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We perform 5000 MCMC steps, with 250 walkers, initialised in a small cluster around the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) model identified from our grid search. The first 75% of the steps for each walker are thrown away as burn- in. The resulting sampling of the posterior is shown in Figure 6.   Figure 6 shows that there is a well-constrained model, featuring a significant absorption component. The me- dian parameter estimates and 68th percentile credible intervals are21: Tcont = 0.153 ± 0.006 K; µemit = 33.1 ± 0.6 km s−1; σemit = 30.0 ± 0.6 km s−1; Aemit = 1.52 ± 0.02 K; µabs = −6.7 ± 2.0 km s−1; σabs = 11.4 ± 1.2 km s−1; and τ (peak ) = 0.38 ± 0.07. The correspond- ing model is plotted in Figure 7. The model is an excel- lent fit to the data, with residuals that are well-behaved given the RMS.   [Cii] ABSORPTION Our SOFIA-upGREAT data for the IC 342 sightline is well fit by our model incorporating [Cii] emission and dust emission from IC 342, and [Cii] absorption from the intervening Milky Way ISM. It is possible that the ap- parent Milky Way absorption feature in the spectrum is simply due to intrinsic asymmetry in the velocity structure of the [Cii] emission profile of the background galaxy IC 342 itself. However, it would require us to be exceptionally unlucky for a circumstantial asymmetry to so closely replicate the properties of the [Cii] absorption feature we were expecting – especially given the lack any of such asymmetry in the CO spectrum of the ex- act same region (as per Section 3.2.2). A model where there are two Gaussian emission components (plus con- tinuum) does provide an acceptable fit to the data – al- though the residuals for this alternative model are signif- icantly worse than those for our model with absorption. Specically, our model with absorption has a χ2 = 41.2 in the −100 < vLSR ≲ 150 km s−1 velocity range – as compared to χ2 of 67.0 for a model with two emitting Gaussian components and no absorption.   We do not believe that contamination from Milky Way [Cii] emission could be significantly affecting the ob- servations, or the model. The contribution of Galac- tic [Cii] emission should be well subtracted from our data by SOFIA-upGREAT dual beam switching (see Section 3.2). As noted in Table 1, we predict that the Milky Way [Cii] emission towards this sightline should have brightness corresponding to 92% of level of ab-   sorption expected against the dust continuum emission from IC 342. This predicted contamination from Galac- tic [Cii] emission therefore corresponds to 20% of the IC 342 dust continuum level, which equates to 0.03 K – much smaller than the >4 K amplitude of the absorp- tion we measure against the [Cii] emission from IC 342. So even if the SOFIA-upGREAT dual beam switching somehow provided a very poor subtraction of the Galac- tic [Cii] emission, it would still be negligible in amplitude compared to our apparent absorption feature.   The model has an integrated Galactic [Cii] line opac- ity of  τ[CII] dv = 9.36 ± 2.38 km s−1 (uncertainty being the 68.3% quantile range of integrated line opacities cal- culated from the MCMC posterior samples), making it a S/N = 4 measurement. This value of  τ[CII] dv is 70% more than our prediction (see Table 1); this corresponds to a 1.6 σ difference, given the uncertainty.   Following Equation 2, our MAP integrated line opac- ity corresponds to a total C+ column density of (1.31 ± 0.33) × 1018 cm−2. Assuming gas-phase carbon is pre- dominantly in C+ (see Section 2.2.4), the gas-phase car- H ] = 8.54+0.10 bon abundance we measure is 12 + log10[ C −0.13. The C+ column density we measure therefore exceeds the total carbon column density we had predicted for this sightline (of 1.14 × 1018 cm−2). On face value, this implies that there is no carbon depletion along this sight- line; technically we measure carbon ‘enhancement’ (ie, positive depletion) of δC = 0.06+0.10 −0.13 dex. However, the uncertainties on this measurement encompass zero, and indeed extend down to carbon depletion as strong as δC = −0.07 dex. In other words, this simply represents a non-detection of carbon depletion for this sightline. Our predicted depletion of δC = −0.19 dex lies within 2 σ of our measurement.   We note that our predictions of the expected total carbon column density were based on the assumption the metal abundances of the sightline match the Milky Way average, for which we adopted 12 + log10[ C H ] = 8.47 (as per Section 2.2.2). But in practice, ISM metallicity can vary significantly between sightlines. For instance, A. M. Ritchey et al. (2023) find metallicities spanning a range of over 0.4 dex for a set of 84 sightlines (although most do lie within 0.1 dex of Solar) – this is a large enough range that our high carbon column density for the IC 342 sightline would lie within the expected varia- tion. We also note that different models predict different carbon abundances. The B. S. Hensley & B. T. Draine (2020) dust model assumes a total interstellar carbon abundance of 12 + log10[ C H ] = 8.52, which is 0.04 dex greater than the abundance we adopted; in this case, the range of carbon depletions compatible with our mea- surement would also be 0.04 dex greater.   To gauge how much variation in ISM metallicity we should expect between sightlines, we note that IC 342 is located at Galactic coordinates of l = 138.17◦, b = +10.58◦, just above the Perseus region of the Galactic   plane. The Perseus region contains many of the stan- dard OB star sightlines used for measuring the metallic- ity of the intervening ISM. A. M. Ritchey et al. (2023) measure the ISM metallicity for 10 sightlines in this area22. For these sightlines A. M. Ritchey et al. (2023) find metallicities spanning a 0.46 dex range for non- refractory elements (ie, elements less susceptible to hav- ing metallicity determinations affected by depletion), with a standard deviation of 0.13 dex, and an aver- age per-sightline metallicity uncertainty of 0.09 dex (see their Table 5). This range of metallicities is greater than the difference between the carbon column density we measure for the IC 342 sightline, and the Milky Way av- erage. It therefore seems plausible that this sightline is probing a column with somewhat elevated metallicity, giving rise to our larger-than-expected column density of carbon.   As already mentioned, it remains possible that the apparent absorption feature is just due to an intrinsic asymmetry in the [Cii] emission profile of IC 342, that happens, by conspicuous misfortune, to closely match our expected absorption feature. We therefore char- acterise this as a possible detection of Galactic [Cii] absorption. Regardless, this result highlights that us- ing [Cii] absorption to probe the Milky Way’s ISM is a practical technique in general – even in the disadvan- tageous situation where [Cii] emission from the back- ground galaxy contaminates the data.   4.1. Lessons Learned from the SOFIA Study   Our experience with this SOFIA program has pro- vided insights that should be useful for efforts to use future facilities to measure carbon abundance and deple- tion via [Cii] absorption (which we consider more fully in Section 5 below).   The first key lesson is the importance of baseline sta- bility for these kinds of observations. Except for sight- lines where the Galactic Hi exhibits a narrow single- featured profile, we cannot know exactly where any [Cii] absorption features will be located, or how wide they will be. Extracting them from the spectra therefore re- quires a very stable baseline (ideally with any baseline variations ≪ τ (peak )   The second key lesson is the importance of consid- ering potential sources of contaminating [Cii] emission. We show in Section 2.3 that contamination from Milky Way [Cii] emission should consistently be surmount- able. However, our SOFIA-upGREAT data for the IC 342 sightline demonstrate that observers should err on the side of caution when considering the risk of [Cii] emission from the background galaxy contaminating the Milky Way velocity range. We do note, however, that   the additional flux provided by the background [Cii] emission from IC 342 actually makes the Galactic [Cii] absorption easier to detect, in an absolute sense. This is because a given τabs now has more photons to absorb than it otherwise would, giving rise to a greater change in observed brightness, increasing the S/N of the absorp- tion. As such, if an observer believes they can accurately constrain the expected [Cii] emission profile of the back- ground galaxy, this might in fact be an advantageous arrangement, from a pure S/N standpoint.   The third key lesson is that for [Cii] absorption to pro- vide strong constraints on carbon depletion, we need to be able to first constrain the metallicity of the ISM along the sightline being probed. For future facilities able to target large numbers of sightlines, it will be possible to use the average Milky Way ISM carbon abundance when probing relations involving many measurements across the sky. Moreover, future optical–NIR integral field spectroscopic projects the like Local Volume Map- per (N. Drory et al. 2024) will provide direct auroral-line ISM metallicity measurements across huge swaths of sky, both in and above the Galactic plane. This will allow for much more accurate estimates of the ISM metallicity along a given sightline (although the portion of the col- umn from which such metallicities are measured won’t necessarily match the integrated column being probed by [Cii] absorption).   With the decommissioning of SOFIA, there are now no telescopes in operation capable of performing the FIR spectroscopy necessary to observe [Cii] absorption. However, such observations will be possible with sev- eral of the FIR concepts proposed for the NASA astro- physics probe mission solicitation, for possible launch in the 2030s, as per the recommendation of the Na- tional Academies’ 2020 decadal survey of astronomy & astrophysics (‘Astro2020’; National Academies 2021). Additionally, Astro2020 recommended a FIR flagship mission, to launch after the UV–optical–NIR Habitable Worlds Observatory, potentially in the 2050s.   Future FIR missions will be able to probe abundances and depletions along sightlines rendered inaccessible in the UV, due to high extinction. In extremis, depletions can currently only be measured towards OB stars with visual extinction up to a few magnitudes, even using Hubble. For instance, the most reddened OB star to- wards which E. B. Jenkins (2009) were able to measure depletions (for elements other than iron) was V1074 Sco, a sightline with E(B −V ) = 0.61 mag of reddening; for a standard Milky Way extinction law of RV = 3.1 (K. D. Gordon et al. 2003), this corresponds to AV = 2.0 mag. Assuming that the Habitable Worlds Observatory has UV spectroscopic capabilities equivalent to the Lu- voir Ultraviolet Multi-Object Spectrograph (LUMOS;   K. France et al. 2017) instrument concept, then it will be able to measure depletions for sightlines a factor of ≈ 300 fainter than the Space Telescope Imaging Spec- trograph (STIS; B. E. Woodgate et al. 1998) on HST, used by E. B. Jenkins (2009). This equates to a ≈ 6 mag improvement, meaning the Habitable Worlds Observa- tory could probe AV ≈ 8.0 mag sightlines. Nonetheless, large portions of the sky, notably much of the Galac- tic plane, exhibit with AV ≥ 10 mag (E. F. Schlafly & D. P. Finkbeiner 2011), rendering them inaccessible for measuring depletion, even by the Habitable Worlds Ob- In the FIR, however, high AV makes [Cii] servatory. absorption easier to detect, as the high dust column does not attenuate the background source, whilst also increasing the absorbing column of C+ (for a given vol- ume density). This makes future FIR missions highly complimentary to the Habitable Worlds Observatory for studying carbon abundance and depletion.   Here, we apply the method laid out in Section 2.2, for identifying sightlines where [Cii] absorption could be detected by multiple proposed FIR facilities, which we describe individually in the subsections below. To es- timate the continuum surface brightness that would be observed by each telescope, we convolved the Herschel- PACS 160 µm observations to the resolution that would be achieved by each telescope at that wavelength23. We then measure the mean surface brightness of each sight- line’s background galaxy, inside an aperture with diam- eter equal to the instrumental FWHM.   We then used the instrumental sensitivities and spec- tral resolutions for each telescope’s design specifications (given in each telescope’s subsection below) to estimate the necessary integration time, and expected τ (peak ) , for each sightline. We note that τ (peak ) [CII] depends on the ve- locity resolution of the instrument; at lower velocity res- olution, the absorption profile will be diluted, reducing the observed τ (peak ) Instrumen- tal sensitivities are typically provided in terms of the brightness of a spectral feature that could be detected at S/N = 5 in an integration time of 1 hr. This can then be used to calculate tint , the time required to achieve S/N = 5 for a spectral feature of a given brightness, ac- cording to:   for a given sightline.   tint = 1 hr ×   where S1hr is the brightness of a spectral feature that could be detected to S/N = 5 in 1 hr as per instrumental specification24, in W m−2; and Starget is the brightness   of the spectral feature of interest (such as a [Cii] absorp- tion feature), in W m−2.   Throughout the rest of this section, we adopt a tar- get S/N of 10, to provide a caution factor in identifying sightlines that are plausibly detectable. As described in Section 2.3.1, detecting [Cii] absorption will also require sky observations, to measure and remove the contribu- tion of Galactic [Cii] emission. For each facility dis- cussed below, we also describe how we will incorporate the need for observations of sky pointings, for measur- ing and subtracting contamination from Galactic [Cii] emission, as per the observing strategy discussed in Ap- pendix C.   We plot tint against τ (peak )   for each sightline, for each telescope, in Figure 8. Highlighted in that plot is the region of the parameter space where observations should be the most practical (although observations outside this range may of course also be possible).   We consider practically-observable integration times to be < 10 hrs (including sky pointings). Observations longer than this will likely represent too great a use of telescope time and resources. Most integrations times in the practical range are much less than 10 hrs. Some candidate sightlines have such bright continuum, and/or enough predicted C+ along the column, that the absorp- tion features are notionally detectable in extremely short integration times, sometimes even ≪ 1 sec. Of course, in this regime, the practicalities of instrumentation mean that significantly more time than this would in fact be required – rather, these sightlines should be considered as requiring ‘arbitrarily short’ integration time, where total observing time in practice will be dictated by read noise, overheads, etc.   We consider practically-observable peak opacity to be τ (peak ) [CII] > 0.01. This limit is motivated by the degree of baseline stability that can be expected from a well- calibrated space-based MIR–FIR spectrometer. For in- stance, the James Webb Space Telescope (J. P. Gard- ner et al. 2006; J. Rigby et al. 2023) Mid InfraRed In- strument (G. S. Wright et al. 2023) Medium Resolu- tion Spectrograph has per-band spectro-photometric re- peatability25 constrained to better than 0.61% on aver- age, with all bands being better than 1.8% (I. Argyriou et al. 2023; specifically, see their Table 4 and Figure 17). The Herschel Space Observatory (G. L. Pilbratt et al. 2010) Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (M. J. Griffin et al. 2010) Fourier Transform Spectrograph had absolute continuum repeatability of <2% (see Figure 3 of R. Hopwood et al. 2015, and Section 5 of R. Hopwood   et al. 2015). The Herschel Hetrodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HiFi; T. de Graauw et al. 2010) had av- erage short-term continuum repeatability of 2.1% (see Table 5.8 of D. Teyssier et al. 2017), although this had a significant contribution from pointing error; for high S/N HiFi observations, the spectral-element-to-spectral- element RMS usually dominates over any baseline vari- ations (see Figure 5.28 of D. Teyssier et al. 2017).   We therefore consider it reasonable to expect that τ (peak ) [CII] > 0.01 features (ie, peak absorption strength of 1%) will be detectable with future FIR facilities. Indeed, the proposed PRIMA mission (see Section 5.1 below) is expected to have baseline stability sufficient for < 1% features to be detectable in a single spectral channel in high-S/N observations (J. Glenn, priv. comm.).   The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA; C. Bradford et al. 2022) is a mission concept that has been down-selected as the FIR candidate for NASA’s astrophysics probe solicitation. The mission’s main focus would be on efficient low-resolution spec- troscopic mapping. However, the design also includes   a potential medium-resolution mode, the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS), with spec- troscopic resolution of R = 4 400 at 158 µm, provid- ing 68 km s−1 velocity resolution, with sensitivity allow- ing 2 × 10−19 Wm−2 spectral features to be detected at S/N = 5 in 1 hr26. PRIMA would have a 2–3 m primary mirror; to be conservative, we assume the 20′′ angu- lar resolution of a 2 m mirror, when using the Herschel- PACS 160 µm data to estimate the continuum brightness that PRIMA would observe.   The PRIMA mission is not primarily motivated by making high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, so its spectral resolution is more modest than that of SOFIA-upGREAT, or some other proposed FIR facili- ties. As a consequence, the 68 km s−1 velocity resolution of PRIMA-FIRESS is 5 times wider than the median predicted FWHM of the [Cii] absorption in our candi- date sightlines (with 98% of all candidate sightlines hav- ing FWHM < 68 km s−1). This means that [Cii] absorp-   tion will be significantly diluted for the vast majority of sightlines. Not only does this mean that more integra- tion is required to achieve a detection, but also means that observed τ (peak ) is expected to be very low. It also raises the risk of ‘unresolved saturation’, where the set of pairs of column densities and linewidths that yield adequate fits to the absorption is highly degenerate.   The modest velocity resolution of PRIMA-FIRESS is the most significant issue. Many absorption sightlines would be unresolved in velocity space, resulting in a low obtainable τ (peak ) , as can be seen in Figure 8. There are 17 candidate sightlines that we find could be de- tected at S/N = 10 by PRIMA-FIRESS in < 10 hrs of integration time (with another 4 detectable with longer intergrations), and with τ (peak ) [CII] > 0.01. Whilst not an especially large number, it would still be enough to al- most double the 19 existing measurements of interstellar carbon abundance in the literature, from the UV. Addi- tionally, a benefit of PRIMA-FIRESS is that the slit in Band 4 (which includes the 158 µm wavelength of [Cii]) has a length of 13′; therefore no dedicated sky obser- vations would need to be made, as >10 FWHM of sky sampling would be provided either side of a target cen- tered in the middle of the slit.   The Far-InfraRed Spectroscopy Space Telescope (FIRSST; B. McGuire et al. 2023) is a mission concept that was developed for NASA’s astrophysics probe so- licitation. whilst FIRSST was not down-selected for the final selection round, it nonetheless serves as a useful case for considering the capabilities that future facili- ties may provide. As the name suggests, the mission has a spectroscopic focus, to probe astrochemistry in various environments. The FIRSST Heterodyne Spec- troscopy Instrument (HSI) would have resolving power of R > 105, providing at least 3 km s−1 velocity resolu- tion, with sensitivity allowing 1.8 × 10−19 Wm−2 spec- tral features to be detected at S/N = 5 in 1 hr27. FIRSST would have a ≈2 m primary mirror; therefore we assume the corresponding 20′′ angular resolution when using the Herschel-PACS 160 µm data to estimate observed con- tinuum brightness. FIRSST-HSI would have two 10- pixel arrays in each band; modulo Nyquist sampling, we therefore we assume that two sky pointings would be required to estimate Galactic [Cii] emission for each sightline.   Thanks to the high spectral resolution and sensitiv- ity of FIRSST-HSI, it would be well suited to observa- tions of [Cii] absorption, as can be seen in Figure 8. We   find 71 sightlines that could be detected at S/N = 10 by FIRSST-HSI in < 10 hrs of integration time. Compared to the 19 UV measurements of neutral ISM carbon abun- dance and depletion in the existing literature, FIRSST- HSI would therefore provide a major step-change in our ability to probe interstellar carbon.   The Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS; G. Chin et al. 2024) is a mission concept that was developed for for NASA’s astrophysics probe solicitation, although it was not down-selected for the final selection round. It would use a deployable pri- It’s mary mirror to achieve a 14 m primary aperture. High Resolution Receiver (HiRX) would provide resolv- ing power of R = 106–107, providing 0.3 km s−1 veloc- ity resolution, with sensitivity allowing 5 × 10−19 Wm−2 spectral features to be detected at S/N = 5 in 1 hr. The 14 m primary mirror would be passively cooled by the sunshield, and would provide 2.8′′ resolution at 158 µm. This 2.8′′ resolution dramatically exceeds the reso- lution of the Herschel-PACS data we have been us- ing to estimate the continuum surface brightness of the background target background galaxies that would ob- served by each telescope. Such estimates for SALTUS would therefore be significantly overestimated, due to the greatly reduced beam dilution of SALTUS versus Herschel-PACS. No FIR data exists with sufficient res- olution to allow us to reliably determine how much brighter the central surface brightness of the background galaxies would be at the SALTUS resolution. The dif- ference would no doubt vary depending on the structure of the FIR-bright core of each galaxy. To be conserva- tive, we simply use the estimates based on the Herschel- PACS data, with the caveat that the resulting estimated integration times for SALTUS are likely overestimated a factor of several. We additionally assume that two sky pointings, to either side of a target, would be required to constrain the Milky Way [Cii] emission towards the a sightline.   Even with the added conservativeness of our calcula- tions, we still find that SALTUS-HiRX would excel at measuring [Cii] absorption – we find that 96 of our can- didate sightlines would be plausible targets. This is the most of any of the proposed future facilities we consider.   The Origins Space Telescope (D. Leisawitz et al. 2018; M. Meixner et al. 2019) is a mission concept that was submitted to Astro2020, as one of the New Great Ob- servatories28. A FIR flagship telescope, on the model of Origins, was recommended by Astro2020, for launch in the decades following the launch of the Habitable Worlds   Observatory. Whilst this mission would not necessarily be Origins per se, we use the published telescope spec- ifications for Origins here to evaluate the observability of candidate [Cii] absorption sightlines.   The high-resolution mode of the Origins Survey Spec- trometer (OSS; C. M. Bradford et al. 2018) would have resolving power of R = 104.5 at 157.7 µm, providing 10 km s−1 velocity resolution, with sensitivity allowing 4 × 10−21 Wm−2 spectral features to be detected at S/N = 5 in 1 hr. We use the 20′′ slit of the Origins-OSS high-resolution mode to compute the surface brightness it would observe, based on the Herschel-PACS 160 µm data. The 5.9 m primary mirror of Origins would give resolution of 6.7′′, 1.8 times better than that of Herschel- PACS; we therefore leave the Herschel-PACS maps at their native resolution, to provide conservative estimates of the surface brightnesses that Origins would observe. The 20′′ slit of the Origins-OSS high-resolution mode therefore samples 3 FWHM of sky; as such two sky pointings, one either side of the target pointing, would provide sky sampling that exactly replicates the sky sub- traction arrangement discussed in Section 2.3.1 and Ap- pendix C.   Origins-OSS would also have an ultra-high-resolution mode. Whilst this would have significantly better ve- locity resolution than the high-resolution mode (by a factor of 7), it also has significantly poorer sensitivity (by a factor of 37). Moreover, the field-of-view of the ultra-high-resolution mode would be only a single 6.7′′ beam, making it prohibitively time-expensive to conduct enough off pointings for accurate sky estimation. Fewer than 10 of our candidate sightlines would be detectable by the ultra-high-resolution mode in under 10 hours of integration time; all of these sightlines would be easily detectable with the high-resolution mode   With the Origins-OSS high-resolution mode, we find that 94 candidate sightlines fall in the plausible-target parameter space, plotted in Figure 8. As can be seen in that figure, the limiting factor for Origins-OSS is not integration time, but rather the τ (peak ) that would be observed. The 10 km s−1 velocity resolution of Origins- OSS high-resolution mode is wide enough that 71% of candidate sightlines would be unresolved, therefore di- luting their observed τ (peak ) Indeed, the exceptional sensitivity of Origins, driven by its 6 m class cooled mir- ror, means that all 94 sightlines could notionally be ob- served to S/N = 10 in a combined integration time of under 1 hour.   We have presented the novel method of using 158 µm [Cii] absorption to measure the abundance and depletion of carbon in the neutral ISM. Making these measure- ments in the UV is extremely challenging, and is cur- rently impossible in the highest-density environments, or in galaxies beyond the Milky Way.   We produced a catalog of 402 sightlines, using FIR- bright nearby galaxies as background source, predicting the Galactic [Cii] absorption that would be measured towards each. This catalog is being made publicly avail- able, for the use of future observers??.   We conducted a pilot study, using SOFIA-upGREAT, in which we attempted to detect [Cii] absorption along 2 sightlines from this catalog, towards the Circinus and IC 342 galaxies. We report a possible detection of [Cii] absorption along the IC 342 sightline, although it re- quires disentangling [Cii] emission from IC 342 itself. Whilst the apparent Galactic [Cii] absorption has very high statistical significance, it is not impossible that the apparent [Cii] absorption feature is instead caused by intrinsic structure in the velocity profile of the [Cii] emission from IC 342, which happens to be very pre- cisely mimicking expected appearance of Galactic [Cii] absorption. In any event, the result demonstrates the practicality of the basic methodology.   Assuming that gas-phase carbon is predominated by C+, our measured [Cii] absorption corresponds to a gas- phase carbon abundance of 12+log10[ C H ] = 8.54. This is greater than the average Milky Way ISM carbon abun- dance. No detection of [Cii] absorption was achieved for the Circinus sightline, which we ascribe to an insuf- ficiently stable instrumental baseline.   We also use our catalog of candidate sightlines to as- sess the potential for three proposed future FIR facilities – PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins – to detect [Cii] absorption. We find that FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins, and to a lesser extend PRIMA, would indeed be able to detect [Cii] absorption along a large number of sightlines. This would dramatically expand our abil- ity to study the abundance, depletion, and behaviour of arguably the most important metal in the diffuse ISM.   Our Circinus observations were conducted in total power mode. We initially chose to use total power mode for all of our observations; although dual beam- switching mode tends to provide a superior sky subtrac- tion, it has a maximum throw of only 5′, which would be in the outskirts of FIR-emitting discs of our target galaxies. We used a ‘off’ position 11.8′ south-east of the center of Circinus, selected to be beyond the FIR structure of Circinus, and in a region with Galactic cir- rus surface-brightness approximately equal to that at Circinus’ center. We used an on-off cycle with 30 sec integrations at each position.   Our observed spectrum for the Circinus sightline is plotted in Figure A1, displayed at our specified velocity binning of 3.3 km s−1; also plotted is the HI4PI Hi spec- trum. The Milky Way Hi velocity range is highlighted; the two Hi features at ≈ +40 and ≈ +70 km s−1 are Galactic high-velocity clouds. There is no obvious [Cii] absorption feature. However, the SOFIA-upGREAT spectrum has RMS noise of 41 mK; this is slightly more than twice the 19 mK noise we predicted, based on the SOFIA integration time calculator.   The RMS for the Circinus sightline is not helped by the strongly-varying baseline that these observations appear to suffer from. The > 1 K continuum level at −150 < vLSR ≲ −50 km s−1 is far in excess of the 0.28 K continuum expected based on the Herschel-PACS 160 µm surface brightness (also plotted for comparison). Our observatory support scientist suggested that the negative brightness temperatures at > 50 km s−1 are   possibly an instrumental artefact arising from poorer instrumental sensitivity at that bluest edge of the pass- band.   The other 6 pixels of SOFIA-upGREAT, each offset ≈ 30′′ from the central pixel, do not show the bright > 1 K continuum we see in the central pixel, suggesting that this may indeed be dust continuum emission from Circinus, as opposed to an instrumental artefact. The absence of this emission feature from the 6 off-center pixels, along with the feature’s flat, broad profile, means that we can be confident that this emission is not asso- ciated with Galactic [Cii] emission. As per Table D1, we expect the Galactic [Cii] emission along the Circinus sightline to be 1.62 times brighter than the [Cii] absorp- tion. Therefore, as long as the sky subtraction provided by the off position is accurate to within 12.3%, then the absorption feature would still be detectable with uncer- tainty of <20% (ie, with S/N>5).   In the Herschel data for Circinus, the surface bright- ness of Galactic dust emission within a 10′–15′ annu- lus around the target (ie, approximately corresponding to the 11.8′ throw of the off position) has a standard deviation of 9.6% (relative to the mean flux in the an- nulus, which incorporates the absolute flux level based on all-sky data). Assuming variation in dust surface brightness should generally trace variation in diffuse [Cii] surface brightness, then this 9.6% represents the sky-subtraction error we would expect from a randomly- placed off position with 11.8′ throw. However, we specif- ically selected our off position to be as representative as possible of the apparent level of Galactic emission in the direction of the sightline itself, so the accuracy of our foreground subtraction should significantly exceed this. We therefore are confident that the accuracy of the sub- traction of Milky Way [Cii] emission provided by the off position will be comfortably better than the 12.3% required for good measurement of [Cii] absorption   It is not inconceivable that the high continuum bright- ness temperature we observe in our SOFIA-upGREAT spectrum is due to variability over the decade since Circinus was observed by Herschel-PACS. Circinus is known to host an obscured Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with a dusty circumnuclear disc (K. R. W. Tris- tram et al. 2022) – and it is known that the luminosity",

         "  From $>1000$ orbits of HST imaging, we present deep homogeneous resolved star\ncolor-magnitude diagrams that reach the oldest main sequence turnoff and\nuniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 36 dwarf galaxies ($-6\n\\ge M_V \\ge -17$) associated with the M31 halo, and for 10 additional fields in\nM31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream. From our SFHs we find: i) the median\nstellar age and quenching epoch of M31 satellites correlate with galaxy\nluminosity and galactocentric distance. Satellite luminosity and present-day\ndistance from M31 predict the satellite quenching epoch to within $1.8$ Gyr at\nall epochs. This tight relationship highlights the fundamental connection\nbetween satellite halo mass, environmental history, and star formation\nduration. ii) There is no difference between the median SFH of galaxies on and\noff the great plane of Andromeda satellites. iii) $\\sim50$\\% of our M31\nsatellites show prominent ancient star formation ($>12$ Gyr ago) followed by\ndelayed quenching ($8-10$ Gyr ago), which is not commonly observed among the MW\nsatellites. iv) A comparison with TNG50 and FIRE-2 simulated satellite dwarfs\naround M31-like hosts show that some of these trends (dependence of SFH on\nsatellite luminosity) are reproduced in the simulations while others\n(dependence of SFH on galactocentric distance, presence of the\ndelayed-quenching population) are weaker or absent.

INTRODUCTION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOur knowledge of low-mass galaxy formation has long\nbeen anchored by Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxies.\nTheir demographics (i.e. numbers, luminosities, spatial\nconfiguration), kinematics, stellar abundance patterns,\norbital histories, and star formation histories (SFHs)\nprovide stringent tests of Cold Dark Matter (CDM), the\nphysics of galaxy formation on the smallest scales, and\nthe relationship between cosmic reionization and low-\nmass galaxies (e.g., Mateo et al. 1998; Simon & Geha\n2007; Tolstoy et al. 2009; Kirby et al. 2013; Brown et al.\n2014; Weisz et al. 2014a; Frebel & Norris 2015; Bullock\n& Boylan-Kolchin 2017; Simon 2019; Patel et al. 2020;\nSacchi et al. 2021; Sales et al. 2022).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe progenitors of present-day MW satellite galaxies\nlikely occupied a broadly representative volume in the\nvery early Universe (z ∼ 7), but now the MW satellites\nreside in a highly biased region (e.g., Boylan-Kolchin\net al. 2016). It remains unclear if the insights learned\nfrom MW satellites, and their particular formation path-\nways, are applicable to other satellite systems and low-\nmass galaxies in general (e.g., Gandhi et al. 2024).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOn the one hand, some present-day properties (e.g.\nluminosity function, quenched fraction) of the bright-\nest MW satellites are similar to other satellite systems\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\n∗ NASA Hubble Fellow\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\naround MW-mass hosts in the Local Volume (e.g., Chi-\nboucas et al. 2013; Carlsten et al. 2022; Mao et al. 2021;\nDanieli et al. 2023; Mao et al. 2024; Geha et al. 2024).\nOn the other hand, there are well-documented differ-\nences in the properties (e.g. numbers, morphologies,\nspatial configurations, sizes, and SFHs) of satellites of\nthe MW compared to those of M31, the closest L⋆ galaxy\nand the only other satellite system which can be ob-\nserved to a comparable level of detail and faintness as the\nMW (e.g., McConnachie & Irwin 2006a; Brasseur et al.\n2011; Tollerud et al. 2012; Monachesi et al. 2012; Conn\net al. 2013; Ibata et al. 2013; Geha et al. 2015; Mar-\ntin et al. 2016; Geha et al. 2017; Skillman et al. 2017;\nD’Souza & Bell 2018; Greco et al. 2018; M¨uller et al.\n2018; Pawlowski 2018; Smercina et al. 2018; Pawlowski\net al. 2019; Doliva-Dolinsky et al. 2023; Savino et al.\n2022, 2023). Whether these differences are the result\nof variance in the intrinsic nature of low-mass galaxy\nformation, due to the specific accretion histories of the\nMW and M31 (e.g., D’Souza & Bell 2021; Engler et al.\n2021), or some other factor(s) is an open question that\ncan only be resolved through systematic studies of low-\nmass satellite systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nM31 and its satellites are an important frontier for ex-\nploring the formation and evolution of low-mass satel-\nlites over cosmic time. With characteristic distances of\n∼ 800 kpc (e.g., de Grijs & Bono 2014; Savino et al.\n2022), it is possible to resolve M31 and its satellites\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\ninto individual stars with our most powerful ground- and\nspace-based facilities. Resolved star studies of the M31\nsatellites enable measurements of SFHs, stellar abun-\ndance patterns, and proper motions to a level of preci-\nsion comparable to MW satellites (e.g., Williams et al.\n2009; Hidalgo et al. 2011; Barker et al. 2011; Ho et al.\n2012; Monachesi et al. 2012; Tollerud et al. 2012; Ho\net al. 2015; Collins et al. 2013; Vargas et al. 2014; Weisz\net al. 2014c; Geha et al. 2015; Monelli et al. 2016; Skill-\nman et al. 2017; van der Marel et al. 2019; Kirby et al.\n2020; McQuinn et al. 2023; Sohn et al. 2020; Savino et al.\n2023; Fu et al. 2024a).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor the foreseeable future (e.g. until large-aperture\nUV/optical space telescopes, such as the Habitable\nWorlds Observatory, are deployed), M31 is the only\nsatellite system that can be studied in comparable de-\ntail and completeness as the MW satellites. The next\nclosest satellite systems around L⋆ hosts have distances\nof ∼3-4 Mpc. At such distances, measuring SFHs from\nthe oldest main sequence turnoff (oMSTO; mI ≳ 31) is\nprohibitive (crowding, faintness) even with JWST (e.g.,\nSavino et al. 2024), abundances of the red giant branch\n(RGB) stars are beyond even our most powerful spec-\ntrographs currently in operation (e.g., Keck, VLT)1, and\nproper motions will require multi-decade time baselines.\nThe enormous scientific potential for resolved star\nstudies of the M31 satellites has been recognized for\ndecades. Since the discovery of the first faint M31 satel-\nlites by van den Bergh (1972, 1974), there have been in-\ncreasingly dedicated efforts to identify and characterize\nsub-structures (i.e., satellites and streams) around M31\nthrough imaging (e.g., Ibata et al. 2001; Ferguson et al.\n2002; McConnachie et al. 2003; Zucker et al. 2004a,b;\nMartin et al. 2006; McConnachie & Irwin 2006a,b; Ibata\net al. 2007; Majewski et al. 2007; Zucker et al. 2007; Ir-\nwin et al. 2008; McConnachie et al. 2008; Martin et al.\n2009; McConnachie et al. 2009; Bell et al. 2011; Richard-\nson et al. 2011; Slater et al. 2011; Bernard et al. 2015b;\nMartin et al. 2016; Doliva-Dolinsky et al. 2022, 2023).\nIn particular, the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Sur-\nvey (PAndAS) has been foundational for our knowledge\nof the M31 system. Using the CFHT, PAndAS under-\ntook a deep, wide-area imaging survey out to a projected\ndistance of 150 kpc from M31, resulting in the discovery\nof 16 M31 satellites as faint as MV ∼ −6, along with\nprominent streams, shells, globular clusters, and other\nstellar sub-structures (see McConnachie et al. 2018 and\nreferences therein). The discovery of new M31 satel-\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n1 At such distances stellar abundances of the brightest resolved\nRGB stars may be tractable with ELTs and JWST spectroscopy\n(e.g., Sandford et al. 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nlites continues apace with fainter, lower surface bright-\nness, and/or more distant M31 satellites recently be-\ning reported (e.g., Martin et al. 2013a,b; Collins et al.\n2022b; Mart´ınez-Delgado et al. 2022; McQuinn et al.\n2023; Collins et al. 2024).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThere has been substantial effort to characterize the\nstellar populations and kinematics of the M31 satellites.\nFirst, the Keck telescope has played a central role in\nspectroscopic studies of the entire M31 system. With\nits excellent sensitivity and moderate resolution, large\ninvestments of Keck/DEIMOS time have provided ve-\nlocities for thousands of stars throughout the M31 sys-\ntems, along with chemical abundances for a sizable frac-\ntion of these stars (e.g., Majewski et al. 2007; Kalirai\net al. 2009, 2010; Collins et al. 2010; Tollerud et al.\n2012; Howley et al. 2013; Vargas et al. 2014; Ho et al.\n2015; Gilbert et al. 2019; Kirby et al. 2020; Wojno et al.\n2020; Escala et al. 2021). These incredible spectroscopic\ndatasets have provided dark matter halo mass estimates\nand radial velocities for most known M31 satellites (e.g.,\nTollerud et al. 2012; Collins et al. 2013), along with\nmetallicities and detailed abundance patterns for the\nbrighter systems (Vargas et al. 2014; Ho et al. 2015;\nKirby et al. 2020; Wojno et al. 2020). Fainter M31\nsatellites are not as well characterized spectroscopically,\nprimarily owing to the paucity of RGB stars in each sys-\ntem. More dedicated spectroscopy is required and/or al-\nternative approaches to acquiring stellar chemistry are\nrequired for these faint systems (e.g., Fu et al. 2022,\n2024a).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSecond, the exquisite sensitivity and high angular res-\nolution of HST has been required for measuring SFHs\nand orbital histories. On the SFH side, only HST has\nhad the ability to construct color-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs) that reach the oldest main sequence turnoff\n(oMSTO). Initially, shallower HST data revealed the\npresence of asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB) and\nred horizontal branches in many M31 satellites, sugges-\ntive of intermediate age star formation in many of these\nsystems (e.g., Da Costa et al. 1996, 2000, 2002; Mar-\ntin et al. 2017). Given the significant integration times\ninvolved in reaching the oMSTO at ∼ 800 kpc, the mea-\nsurement of ‘gold standard’ SFHs was a slow process\nwith an early focus on M31, M33, and the bright ellipti-\ncal systems not found around the MW (M32, NGC 147,\nand NGC 185; Brown et al. 2006, 2008; Williams et al.\n2009; Barker et al. 2011; Bernard et al. 2012; Monachesi\net al. 2012; Bernard et al. 2015b,a; Geha et al. 2015) and\nan expansion to other, fainter systems in the mid-2010s.\nThe first SFHs of faint M31 satellites based on MSTO-\ndepth CMDs were from the Initial Star formation and\nLifetimes of Andromeda Satellites (ISLAndS) program\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n(Weisz et al. 2014c; Monelli et al. 2016; Skillman et al.\n2017). This ∼100 orbit HST program surveyed six M31\nsatellites that spanned a factor of ∼100 in luminosity.\nPerhaps the most remarkable finding from ISLAndS was\nthe high degree of similarity in the SFHs of all six sys-\ntems. All formed ∼50% of their stellar mass ≳ 12 Gyr\nago, while the remainder formed at intermediate ages,\nfollowed by nearly simultaneous quenching ∼ 5 − 6 Gyr\nago. These trends were qualitatively different from those\nof MW satellites with similar properties (e.g., compara-\nble luminosity, distance from host galaxy). However,\nthe limited statistical power of six galaxies prohibited\nbroader conclusions. A shallower HST survey of the re-\nmainder of the M31 satellites (Martin et al. 2017) hinted\nat similar trends across the M31 system, but the limited\ndepth of the imaging resulted in large systematic uncer-\ntainties on the formal SFH measurements (Weisz et al.\n2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHST imaging of M31 satellites that reaches the oM-\nSTO is also well-suited for proper motion measurements.\nThe astrometric stability, sensitivity, and angular reso-\nlution (for high fidelity point spread function characteri-\nzation and star-galaxy differentiation) of HST (and now\nJWST) is uniquely suited for these measurements. How-\never, to date, only M31, NGC 147, NGC 185, And III,\nand And VII have proper motions based on HST imag-\ning (Sohn et al. 2012, 2020; Warfield et al. 2023; Casetti-\nDinescu et al. 2024); proper motions based on other ob-\nservations (e.g., Gaia, VLBI) have been published for\na handful of galaxies associated with the M31 system\n(Brunthaler et al. 2005, 2007; van der Marel et al. 2019;\nMcConnachie et al. 2021; Battaglia et al. 2022; Bennet\net al. 2024). Several HST and JWST programs are tar-\ngeting the ISLAndS galaxies for PM measurements. As\ndiscussed at several points in this paper, a complete cen-\nsus of orbital histories for the M31 satellites is essential\nfor unraveling the likely complex formation of the M31\nsystem as we see it today.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe HST Survey of M31 Satellites Treasury program\nis a Cycle 27 program (GO-15902, PI:Weisz) that was\ndesigned to acquire oMSTO imaging for all known M31\nsatellites that lacked such data. The primary goals of\nthe program are to (a) uniformly measure SFHs of the\nentire M31 satellite system; (b) determine homogenous\nRR Lyrae-based distances to all known M31 satellites;\n(c) provide first epoch proper motion imaging for the\nfaint M31 satellites; and (d) provide the community with\na uniformly reduced HST legacy photometric dataset for\nall new and archival observations of the M31 satellites.\nTo date, this program has produced several signifi-\ncant results. First, Savino et al. (2022) uniformly mea-\nsured RR Lyrae distances to nearly all M31 satellites\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nand anchored them to the Gaia distance scale. This\nwork resulted in a revision to the 3D geometry of the\nM31 satellite systems, affirmed the anisotropic spatial\ndistribution of the satellites, and added new complexity\ninto questions about the putative plane of M31 satellites.\nSecond, Savino et al. (2023) presented SFHs of six ultra-\nfaint dwarfs (UFDs) orbiting M31, the first oMSTO SFH\nof UFDs outside the MW halo. They show that while\nmost systems are predominantly ancient, similar to MW\nUFDs, they tend to have longer periods of low-level star\nformation post-reionization and later quenching epochs.\nSavino et al. (2023) also present the SFH of And XIII,\nwhich formed a remarkable 75% of its stellar mass in a\nrapid burst ∼ 10 Gyr ago.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this paper, we present an overview of our HST Sur-\nvey of M31 Satellites, and describe and release the pho-\ntometric data from > 1000 orbits of new and archival\nHST imaging.

This\nselection resulted in a sample of 24 targets, from which\nwe excluded the galaxy IC 10, as its high line-of-sight\nextinction (AV = 4.5, Green et al. 2019) makes its oM-\nSTO unreachable with HST.

General Observing Strategy\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor all new observations, we used the F606W and\nF814W filters on ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS. This fil-\nter combination has a higher throughput, but reduced\nsensitivity to metallicity and effective temperature, com-\npared to the F475W and F814W filters used by the\nLCID and ISLAndS programs. We designed our pro-\ngram assuming we would use informative priors on the\nage-metallicity relationship (AMR), which have been\ncommonly used in SFH measurements of galaxies with\nCMDs of all depths, including those that include the\noMSTO (e.g., Weisz et al. 2011, 2014a; McQuinn et al.\n2015; Skillman et al. 2017; Albers et al. 2019; McQuinn\net al. 2024b). These priors mitigate some of the reduced\nsensitivity to AMRs introduced by our filter choice, and,\neven in the case of the F475W and F814W filters, they\nhelp to reduce the effects of including poorly modeled\nforeground/background contamination in the SFH mea-\nsurement.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nMotivated by the observing strategy of Cole et al.\n(2014), our observations are designed to reach the sub-\ngiant branch (SGB; MV + 3.2, MI ∼ +2.7) of an ancient\n(12 Gyr), metal-poor (∼[Fe/H] = -1.5) population with\na SNR∼ 10 in both filters. This provides a slightly lower\nSNR (∼ 8) for the corresponding MSTO. Our simula-\ntions showed it to be sufficient for accurate SFH recov-\nery, consistent with Cole et al. (2014). Simultaneously,\nwe optimized the observational cadence for the detection\nof RR Lyrae in order to measure high-fidelity distances\nas discussed in Savino et al. (2022). Finally, the number\nof exposures and dithers used, as detailed in the public\nPhase II file, satisfied the astrometric requirements for\nfirst epoch proper motions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe used ACS/WFC as our primary instrument and\nplaced it near the center of each galaxy. WFC3/UVIS\noperated in parallel and sampled the outskirts, either\nproviding a useful sampling of local background for mod-\neling the CMDs of faint, compact galaxies or providing\na second deep CMD for population gradient studies.

Including this time constraint,\nwe found that 244 prime and 244 parallel orbits would\nachieve our depth and cadence requirements. We note\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthat adopting F475W instead of F606W, for the same\ntarget depth, would have increased the total exposure\ntime, and number of orbits, required to complete our\nsurvey by a factor of ∼ 3.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n2.3.

We did not acquire new data for these systems\nand instead, we homogeneously re-analyze these data\nand include it in our final sample. With the exception of\nIC 10 and of very recent discoveries noted above, which\ndo not possess deep HST photometry, the combination\nof our observations and the archival data comprises the\nentire known satellite galaxy system of M31. Here, we\ndescribe the archival data, which is also summarized in\nTable 1.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFor And I, And II, And III, And XV, And XVI,\nand And XXVIII we use ACS/WFC3 and WFC3/UVIS\nimaging from the ISLAndS program (GO-13038, GO-\n13739, PI: Skillman; Skillman et al. 2017).\nFor\nAnd XIX, we use the ACS/WFC imaging from GO-\n15302 (PI: Collins, Collins et al. 2022a). For NGC 147\nand NGC 185, we use ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS\nimaging from GO-10794 and GO-11724 (PI: Geha, Geha\net al. 2015), and additional observations from GO-14769\n(PI: Sohn, Sohn et al. 2020). For M32 we use ACS/WFC\nimaging from GO-9392 (PI: Mateo) and GO-15658 (PI:\nSohn). For IC 1613 and Psc I (also known as LGS3)\nwe use ACS/WFC imaging from the LCID program\n(GO-1505, PI: Gallart, Hidalgo et al. 2011; Skillman\net al. 2014; Gallart et al. 2015) and from GO-13738 (PI:\nShaya).

For each target, we have therefore calcu-\nlated the fraction of total stellar light contained in our\nACS field. We do this by integrating a 2D exponential\nsurface density profile (e.g., as described in Martin et al.\n2016) over our ACS footprint. The only exceptions are\nNGC 147, NGC 185, NGC 205, and M32, for which we\nuse a S´ersic profile (S´ersic 1963). We construct our pro-\nfile using structural parameters (i.e., half-light radius,\nellipticity, position angle and, where relevant, S´ersic in-\ndex) from the literature (Lee 1995; Choi et al. 2002; Mc-\nConnachie & Irwin 2006b; Bell et al. 2011; Slater et al.\n2011; McConnachie 2012; Martin et al. 2013b,c; Crno-\njevi´c et al. 2014; Martin et al. 2016).

In\naddition, most of the dwarf galaxies with archival data\nhave a deep parallel UVIS field (the exceptions being\nM32, IC 1613, and Psc I). However, due to the different\napparent sizes of our sample galaxies, the parallel fields\ncapture a variable amount of the targets’ stellar light,\nranging from very populated fields in our large and lumi-\nnous targets (such as NGC 205) to fields showing few, if\nany, galaxy member stars in our most compact galaxies\n(such as And XX).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFigure 1 shows the placement of the parallel UVIS\nfield in each target for which the images contain a mean-\ningful amount of member stars (see § 3.4).

We reduced and analyzed ACS/WFC imaging\nfrom eight pointings observed as part of GO-9837 (PI:\nFerguson), GO-9873 (PI: Sarajedini) and GO-10190 (PI:\nGarnett). These observations sample the M33 disc at\ndifferent radii, from 0.5 to 5 disc scale lengths from the\ncenter. Due to the large size and complex morphology\nof M33, jointly analyzing these data is the best way we\nhave to obtain a global SFH that is more representative\nof M33 as a whole.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFor M31, we choose to analyze two deep ACS fields\nin the stellar halo. As stellar halos are understood to\ncarry the fossil imprint of past accretion events (e.g.,\nBullock & Johnston 2005; Belokurov et al. 2006, 2018;\nHelmi et al. 2018; Naidu et al. 2020; Deason & Belokurov\n2024), these data will provide an instructive comparative\nbenchmark to the properties of the satellites.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe first field, observed by GO-9453 (PI: Brown), tar-\ngets the inner smooth halo of M31, at a projected dis-\ntance of 11 kpc from its center. We only analyze roughly\nhalf of the 250 images acquired by ACS on this field.\nEven with this reduced dataset, this is the deepest pho-\ntometric field in our sample.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe other field, observed by GO-10265 (PI: Brown),\ntargets the GSS, which is the most prominent tidal fea-\nture of the M31 halo, hosts a stellar population that is\nrepresentative of most of the inner halo substructures\n(e.g., Bernard et al. 2015b), and is one of the main\nmanifestations of M31’s recent accretion history (e.g.,\nMcConnachie et al. 2018). As a caveat, we stress that\nboth M31’s smooth halo and the GSS have very large\napparent sizes and are known to have significant stellar\npopulation gradients (e.g., Ferguson et al. 2002; Gilbert\net al. 2014; Conn et al. 2016; Cohen et al. 2018; Escala\net al. 2020, 2021, 2023). An extensive analysis of the\nstellar populations in these two components is imprac-\ntical with the small FoV of ACS and it is not within\nthe scope of this paper. Nevertheless, we deem useful to\ninclude these two datasets to enable a first-order com-\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 2.

Photometric Catalogs\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe start the photometric reduction from the pre-\nreduced FLC frames, as retrieved from MAST. We re-\nduce the images using DOLPHOT (Dolphin 2000, 2016;\nWeisz et al. 2024), a popular point-spread-function\n(PSF) photometry package that has been used on many\nHST studies of nearby galaxies (e.g., Holtzman et al.\n2006; Dalcanton et al. 2009; McQuinn et al. 2010; Mon-\nelli et al. 2010; Radburn-Smith et al. 2011; Dalcan-\nton et al. 2012; Weisz et al. 2014a; Williams et al.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2014, 2021). We use the same DOLPHOT parameter set\nup established by the PHAT project (Dalcanton et al.\n2012; Williams et al. 2014), which is well-optimized for\ncrowded HST fields. While our dwarf fields are not as\ncrowded as the PHAT observations of M31’s disk, test-\ning on our images, and independent testing on a range\nof crowding regimes (e.g., Weisz et al. 2024), confirmed\nthat this set-up is optimal to analyze our data. The\nonly exception is the PSF-PhotIt parameter, which we\nset to 2. This choice adds a second iteration to the PSF\nphotometry solution, refining the noise estimates and\nincreasing completeness for faint sources.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAfter reduction, we cull the resulting photometric\ncatalogs, to mitigate contamination from background\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 3.

Namely we keep photomet-\nric sources with:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\n• S/N ≥ 4\n• Sharp2 ≤ 0.2\n• Crowd ≤ 0.75\n• Round ≤ 3\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe quality metrics cuts are imposed on both filters\nsimultaneously. The resulting photometric catalogs have\na substantially higher level of purity. We illustrate this\nin Fig. 3, using And XI as an example. The comparison\nbetween the raw DOLPHOT catalog (panel A) and the\nculled catalog (panel B) shows that our selection criteria\ndrastically reduces the amount of contaminant sources\nin the CMD.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n3.2. Bright star masking\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAfter culling the catalog using the quality metrics de-\nscribed above, a major remaining source of photometric\ncontaminants consists of spurious sources detected in\nthe diffraction spikes of bright stars and in stray-light\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nartifacts over the detector. We mitigate this effect by\nfiltering our data through a series of spatial masks that\ncover the most obvious artifacts (see Fig. 4 for an exam-\nple).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFor each one of our fields, we obtain a list of bright\nstars by querying the Gaia database for all sources with\nG < 18, that are inside or immediately adjacent to our\nHST field of view. We inspect each source and we create\na spatial mask that covers both the saturated core and\nany visible diffraction spike. The location, orientation,\nand size of the mask is manually adjusted for each star.\nWe also mask diffraction spikes that arise from sources\njust outside our field of view. Finally, in some cases,\nthere are bright stray-light artifacts obviously identifi-\nable in our images, which we also mask.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn Fig. 4 we provide an example of our masks for the\nAnd XI field, where all the features described above are\nvisible. By removing the sources inside the masked re-\ngions, we further increase the purity of our photometric\ncatalogs, as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (comparison between\npanel B and panel C).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n3.3.

The shaded regions illustrate our spatial masks used\nto exclude diffraction spikes (red). In the upper side of this\nfield, a bright stray light artifact is also masked (orange). At\nthe bottom of this field, also visible are two masked diffrac-\ntion spikes from bright stars just outside our field of view\n(blue).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor most sources in our sample, the target’s stellar\npopulation is the dominant contributor to source counts\nacross the entire primary ACS FoV. However, for some\nof our most compact target galaxies, the bulk of the\nstellar population is concentrated in the central regions\nof the ACS detector, while the outer regions primar-\nily contain contaminant sources. For the CMD analysis\nof this paper, we therefore impose a spatial cut on our\ncatalogs, including only sources within 2rh from the tar-\nget’s photometric center (see Fig. 1 for a visual repre-\nsentation). We exclude M32, NGC 147, NGC 185, and\nNGC 205 from this criterion, because their large stellar\nmass means that even regions at large radii contain a\nlarge population of galaxy member stars.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor most galaxies in our sample, their large angular\nsize and the central positioning of the ACS fields mean\nthat this spatial cut has no effect. However, for some\nof our faintest targets (MV > −9) these cuts signifi-\ncantly increase the purity of the stellar catalog, while\nonly marginally decreasing the stellar counts from the\ntarget’s stellar population. This is shown for the case\nof And XI (MV = −6.4) by comparing panels C and D\nin Fig. 3. For those galaxies for which we reject sources\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nat r > 2rh, we have calculated updated f⋆ values and\nlisted them (in parentheses) in Table 1.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n3.4.

In almost every target, the photometry\nreaches below the SGB and oMSTO per program con-\nstruction. The galaxies show a remarkable diversity of\nCMDs, which imply a variety of formation histories, as\nwe discuss in the context of formal SFH measurements.\nIn terms of depth, two of the shallower datasets belong\nto M32 (archival) and NGC 205 (acquired through our\nprogram). In these two galaxies, despite long integra-\ntion times, the extreme crowding limits our photometric\ndepth to F606W ∼ 28. While we still formally detect the\nSGB of a 13 Gyr stellar population, the incompleteness\nand photometric uncertainties at these magnitudes are\nconsiderably larger than for the rest of our targets. This\nlimitation should be kept in mind when interpreting the\noldest SFH of these two targets.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 6 shows the CMDs of the 15 UVIS parallel fields\nfor which we detect dwarf galaxy member stars. They\nare not quite as deep as the ACS fields, as UVIS is less\nsensitive in the F814W band. Moreover, they exhibit\na broad range of stellar densities. NGC 205 has the\nmost populated UVIS CMD due to its high luminosity,\nlarge size, and the more central location of the UVIS\nfield. The UVIS catalog of NGC 205 contains ∼345,000\nsources compared to the ∼435,000 sources in the ACS\nfield. Conversely, in the lower-luminosity And III, our\nUVIS field centered roughly at 2rh only contains a few\nhundred member stars, compared to ∼70,000 sources\nin the ACS field. With the exception of the And IX\nUVIS field, which contains a large population of M31\nhalo stars, all the UVIS fields not shown in Figure 6\nare essentially empty, as they are dominated by back-\nground galaxies and sparse populations of MW and/or\nM31 stars.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFinally, Fig. 7 shows the CMDs of the M31 and M33\nfields. This figure shows the heterogeneity of these\narchival datasets. Both the M31 fields (Halo and GSS)\nare extremely deep, reaching more than 1 magnitude\nbelow the oMSTO. In M33, the more external photo-\nmetric fields (D3, D4, S1, and S2) are also sufficiently\ndeep to detect the oMSTO. However, as we move to\ninner regions (M9, U49, D2, and D1), crowding increas-\ningly limits the photometric depth achievable. Also no-\nticeable is the change in differential reddening, which is\nessentially absent for the outermost fields, and progres-\nsively increases when moving towards M33’s center.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 5.

Artificial Star Tests\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe characterize the photometric completeness and the\nerror distribution as a function of position on the CMD\nthrough the use of artificial star tests (ASTs). This tech-\nnique is the ‘gold standard’ to model photometric un-\ncertainties in resolved stellar population studies, and is\nabsolutely essential in crowded fields (e.g., Stetson 1987;\nStetson & Harris 1988; Dalcanton et al. 2009; Weisz\net al. 2014b; Williams et al. 2014; Savino et al. 2024).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor each of our ACS and WFC3 fields, we inject\n∼ 5 × 105 synthetic stars in our images. Our input\nartificial stars are uniformly distributed across the ob-\nserved CMD from ∼ 1 magnitude above the tip of the\nRGB to ∼ 2 mag below the detection limit. For the 36\ndwarf galaxies in our primary sample, the ASTs are spa-\ntially distributed following the same 2D density profiles\nused to calculate f⋆. This choice allows us to capture\nthe spatial variation in observational errors and com-\npleteness due to crowding gradients. The ASTs for the\nM31 and M33 are uniformly distributed across the ACS\nfields.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe then repeat the DOLPHOT reduction procedure\nto measure the recovered photometric properties of our\nsynthetic sources. To avoid modifying the crowding\nproperties of the image, the injection and recovery steps\nare performed on one artificial star at a time. After\nreduction, the AST catalogs are processed through the\nexact cuts used for the photometric catalogs (i.e., qual-\nity culling, bright star masking, and spatial cuts).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n4.

We do this using MATCH (Dolphin 2002),\nwhich is a software package designed to measure the SFH\nof a resolved stellar population by forward modeling the\nCMD with a combination of simple stellar population\nmodels. MATCH is a well-tested software that has been\nused in numerous studies of nearby stellar populations\n(e.g., Skillman et al. 2003; Williams et al. 2009; Mc-\nQuinn et al. 2010; Monelli et al. 2010; Weisz et al. 2011,\n2014a; Lewis et al. 2015; McQuinn et al. 2015; Skillman\net al. 2017). We briefly describe the specific assump-\ntions and configuration of our CMD models and refer\nthe reader to the extensive tests carried out in Savino\net al. (2023) regarding the effect of many of these as-\nsumption on measured SFHs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n4.1. Stellar Models\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe create stellar population models using stellar evo-\nlutionary tracks from the BaSTI theoretical grid (Hi-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ndalgo et al. 2018; Pietrinferni et al. 2021, 2024). The\nstellar models we use include the effect of atomic diffu-\nsion, convective core overshooting, and use a Reimer’s\nmass-loss efficiency of η = 0.3. We use models with a\nscaled-solar α-element distribution, which is typical of\nCMD analysis in dwarf galaxies (Monelli et al. 2010;\nSkillman et al. 2017). Although spectroscopic investiga-\ntions of dwarfs in the M31 system revealed large varia-\ntions in stellar α-enhancement, both within individual\ndwarfs and across the satellite population (Vargas et al.\n2014; Kirby et al. 2020), it has long been established\nthat the choice of chemical mixture has a minor effect\non the SFH of old stellar populations, especially if red\nbroadband filters are used (e.g., Salaris et al. 1993; Cas-\nsisi et al. 2004; Savino et al. 2023). The exact α-element\ndistribution adopted will have little impact on our SFHs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n4.2. Model Grid\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe generate stellar population models over a grid\nspanning 7.50 ≤ log10(t/yr) ≤ 10.15, with a 0.05 dex\nresolution, and −3.0 < [F e/H] < 0, with a 0.1 dex\nresolution. We draw stars from a Kroupa initial mass\nfunction (Kroupa 2001), normalized between 0.08 M⊙\nand 120 M⊙, and use an unresolved binary fraction of\n0.35, with secondary masses drawn from a uniform mass\nratio distribution. As demonstrated in Savino et al.\n(2023), all these assumptions do not have a strong im-\npact on the recovered SFH. Consistent with previous\nnearby dwarf analyses (e.g., Weisz et al. 2014a; Skillman\net al. 2017), we impose a physically motivated prior on\nthe age-metallicity relation. During fitting, we impose\nthat the mean metallicity must increase monotonically\nwith time and we allow a modest metallicity dispersion\n(0.15 dex) in each age bin. This is a common choice to\nmitigate the age-metallicity degeneracy on the MSTO,\nand it is especially useful for the F606W/F814W filter\npair, which has limited sensitivity to metallicity (see Ap-\npendix B of Savino et al. 2023 for additional discussion\non this assumption).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\n4.3.

We set the MW foreground ex-\ntinction using the dust maps of Green et al. (2019). The\nonly exceptions are M33 and IC 1613, which are not cov-\nered by the Green et al. (2019) map, and for which we\nuse extinction values from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011).\nFor galaxies that have had recent star formation (i.e.,\nPsc I, Peg DIG, IC 1613, and the photometric fields\nin M33), we apply two more extinction terms, in addi-\ntion to the MW foreground. The first one is an internal\nreddening term that applies to all stars in the stellar\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\npopulation model. This term is intended to capture the\ndiffuse dust content within the dwarf galaxy itself. We\nexplore values of internal reddening ranging from 0 to\ndAV = 2 mag, in steps of 0.1 mag, and adopt the value\nthat results in the best CMD goodness-of-fit parameter.\nOnly the M33 fields are found to require a dAV greater\nthan zero and the best fit values are listed in Table 12.\nThe second term is a uniformly distributed differential\nextinction term that only applies to stars younger than\n100 Myr and is intended to capture the extinction of the\ndense natal environments of these stars.

(2003), this second extinction term is set to\na differential extinction of dAV = 0 at 100 Myr and lin-\nearly increased to a maximum value of dAV = 0.5 mag\nfor stars younger than 40 Myr. Given that most of\nour targets have virtually no amount of recent star for-\nmation, the impact of this assumption is expected to\nbe negligible in most cases. For the few actively star-\nforming galaxies in our sample, choices on this extra ex-\ntinction term only meaningfully affect the SFH within\nthe last 500 Myr. Even for star-forming dwarfs, only 1-\n3% of the total stellar mass is formed in this time span\n(see § 5), so this assumption has a small impact unless\nin applications where the details of the most recent SFH\nare of particular interest.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\n4.4. CMD Fit\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe stellar population models are convolved with ob-\nservational effects (photometric errors and incomplete-\nness) measured by the ASTs described in § 3.5. Both ob-\nserved and model CMDs are converted to density maps\nusing bins of 0.05 mag in color and 0.1 mag in apparent\nmagnitude. We fit the CMD from approximately 1 mag\nabove the tip of the RGB, to a magnitude that corre-\nsponds to the 50% completeness level as listed in Tabs. 1\nand 2. The only exceptions are those fields for which the\n50% completeness limit does not reach the oMSTO and\nfor which we extend our modeling to fainter magnitudes.\nIn particular, for Peg DIG and for the D2, D3, D4, M9,\nand U49 fields of M33 we model down to the 30% com-\npleteness level. For the severely crowded fields of M32,\nNGC 205 and the D1 field of M33, we model the entirety\nof the CMD down to the detection limit. In all of our\ntargets, we exclude the CMD region around the horizon-\ntal branch, to mitigate the accuracy issues of models of\nthis evolutionary phase. As mentioned above, the oldest\nage SFHs measured from CMDs that extend below the\n50% completeness limit should be treated with appro-\npriate caution.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n4.5. Contamination Model\nWhile the procedure outlined in § 3 lets us reject a\nlarge fraction of contaminant sources, our photometric\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncatalogs still contain sources that are not genuine mem-\nber stars of our targets. In particular, unresolved back-\nground galaxies are a major source of contamination at\nthe magnitude of the oMSTO (e.g., Warfield et al. 2023).\nWe address this issue by building a contamination model\nthat is added to our stellar population models during the\nCMD fit.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIdeally, each ACS field has a WFC3/UVIS parallel\nthat could be used as a control field to build the con-\ntamination model. In practice, most UVIS parallels are\nnot suitable either because they contain a substantial\nnumber of member stars (in our most extended targets)\nor because they are so sparse that the reduction does\nnot yield reliable photometry.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe instead choose representative, well-reduced, UVIS\nfields to build a contamination model for all the galaxies\nin our sample. For the F606W/F814W data, we use the\nparallel field of And XXX, while for the F475W/F814W\ndata we use the parallel field of And XV. For these two\nfields, we convert the CMD to a density map, which is\nsmoothed with a 5 × 5 bin kernel. This density field is\nadded to the stellar population model density during the\nCMD fit. As part of the CMD optimization process, we\nallow the code to fit a scale factor for the background\nmodel along with the stellar population parameters.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe only exceptions to this approach are the CMDs\nof And I, And IX, and M32. They each contain sub-\nstantial contamination from M31 halo stars. For these\ngalaxies, we create a custom contamination model. The\ncontamination model for And IX is built using the whole\nUVIS field from its own parallel, which only contains\nM31 stars. Similar to Skillman et al. (2017), for And I\nwe only use a cut-out (r > 3rh) of the UVIS parallel\nfield, chosen to minimize the number of stars from And I\nitself. For M32, we use an ACS control field, adjacent\nto M32, observed as part of program GO-9392.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\n4.6. Uncertainties\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOnce we obtain the best-fit SFH, we calculate the un-\ncertainties following the prescription of Dolphin (2012)\nand Dolphin (2013), which is a common choice in stud-\nies of nearby galaxies (e.g., Weisz et al. 2014a; Skill-\nman et al. 2017). The statistical uncertainties on the\nstar formation rates are obtained by sampling the solu-\ntion parameter space with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\nalgorithm (Duane et al. 1987). The systematic uncer-\ntainties are estimated by perturbing the stellar model\nlibrary with shifts in effective temperature and lumi-\nnosity. We produce 100 perturbed stellar model grids\nand use the dispersion in the SFH solutions to calcu-\nlate the systematic uncertainties. As demonstrated in\nSavino et al. (2023), not only does this method provide\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 8.

SFHs\nfor the individual M33 fields are shown in Appendix C.\nFor most targets, our measurements are the first\nSFHs obtained from oMSTO photometry. However,\nroughly 30% of our sample (roughly corresponding to\nthe archival fields) have previous SFH determination\nfrom deep photometry (e.g., Skillman et al. 2003; Brown\net al. 2006; Williams et al. 2009; Hidalgo et al. 2011;\nBernard et al. 2012; Monachesi et al. 2012; Geha et al.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2015; Skillman et al. 2017; Collins et al. 2022b). In Ap-\npendix D, we provide a comparison between our SFHs\nand some of these previous literature results. Overall,\nthere is good agreement between our SFHs and litera-\nture SFHs, with minor discrepancies due to choices in\nstellar models, distance, and/or extinction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe now take advantage of our large and homoge-\nneous SFH compilation to analyze the star formation\ntimescales of the M31 satellites on a population level,\nboth as a function of other satellite properties and in\ncomparison to the MW satellite population.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n5.1.

Our observations only\ncover a certain fraction of the galaxy’s stellar mass (ap-\nproximately equal to f⋆ in Table 1, assuming small radial\nvariations in mass-to-light ratio), typically close to the\ngalaxy’s center.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nBoth theory (e.g., El-Badry et al. 2016; Graus et al.\n2019) and observations (e.g., Harbeck et al. 2001; Tol-\nstoy et al. 2004; Battaglia et al. 2006; Hidalgo et al.\n2013; Savino et al. 2019; Taibi et al. 2022; Fu et al.\n2024b,a) find stellar population gradients in many low-\nmass galaxies. SFHs measured from a limited field of\nview may therefore be biased relative to a SFH of the en-\ntire galaxy (Graus et al. 2019). Given that our fields tar-\nget the galaxy centers, and that the most recent star for-\nmation is typically more spatially concentrated in low-\nmass galaxies, the effect of incomplete spatial coverage\nis expected to be more important in our measurement\ninvolving old ages (e.g., median star formation epochs),\nand less impactful on estimates of the quenching epoch\n(Graus et al. 2019). There is no clear way to eliminate\nthis source of bias without a prohibitive investment of\nHST/JWST time. Measuring SFHs over the full spa-\ntial extent of nearby galaxies is better suited for wide\nfield-of-view space telescopes such as Euclid or Roman.\nThe effect of limited spatial coverage varies substan-\ntially across the sample. For 15 of our 36 dwarf galaxy\ntargets, our ACS field contains more than 50% of the\ntotal stellar mass, meaning that, while stellar popula-\ntion gradients can still impact our measurements, our\nSFH can still be taken as reasonably representative of\nthe whole galaxy. For spatially larger galaxies, our ACS\nfields can contain as little as a few percent of the total\nstellar mass and stellar population gradients can have a\nlarger impact.

However, ex-\ntracting this information from CMD-based SFHs is sur-\nprisingly challenging (e.g., Skillman et al. 2017; Savino\net al. 2023). Beyond physical mechanisms that initiate\ngalaxy quenching, there are a number of observational\ncontaminants that can introduce low levels of late star\nformation in CMD-based SFHs, which affect estimation\nof the quenching epoch.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOne such source are blue-straggler stars.

Other effects, such as imperfect modeling of the\nforeground/background population and residual photo-\nmetric artifacts, can also introduce noise in the SFH,\npushing the complete end of star formation to younger\nages.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFor these reasons, it is common practice to use met-\nrics such as τ90 (i.e., the lookback time at which 90% of\nthe total star formation occurs), to approximately trace\nstar formation quenching while mitigating the above\nconcerns about contamination (e.g., Weisz et al. 2014b;\nSkillman et al. 2017; Weisz et al. 2019). While this might\nbe an appropriate choice for relatively luminous dwarfs,\nthere is the possibility that it is not sufficiently conserva-\ntive for low-mass dwarfs, as their sparse CMDs are more\nsusceptible to contaminants such as background galax-\nies, especially if the SNR at the oMSTO is relatively\nlow, as is the case for some of our faint systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo mitigate this, we also calculate and adopt the more\nconservative metric τ80 (i.e., the lookback time at which\n80% of the total star formation occurs).

The trade-off of a more\nconservative metric is that it can miss genuine late star\nformation in brighter dwarfs, which also tend to have\nmore extended SFHs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nGiven that our galaxy sample spans 11 magnitudes in\nluminosity, it is challenging to adopt a single quenching\nmetric for all systems.

         " The Hubble Space Telescope Survey of M31 Satellite Galaxies IV. Survey Overview and Lifetime Star Formation Histories   From > 1000 orbits of HST imaging, we present deep homogeneous resolved star color-magnitude diagrams that reach the oldest main sequence turnoff and uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 36 dwarf galaxies (−6 ≥ MV ≥ −17) associated with the M31 halo, and for 10 additional fields in M31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream. From our SFHs we find: i) the median stellar age and quenching epoch of M31 satellites correlate with galaxy luminosity and galactocentric distance. Satellite luminosity and present-day distance from M31 predict the satellite quenching epoch to within 1.8 Gyr at all epochs. This tight relationship highlights the fundamental connection between satellite ii) There is no difference between halo mass, environmental history, and star formation duration. the median SFH of galaxies on and off the great plane of Andromeda satellites. iii) ∼ 50% of our M31 satellites show prominent ancient star formation (> 12 Gyr ago) followed by delayed quenching (8 − 10 Gyr ago), which is not commonly observed among the MW satellites. iv) A comparison with TNG50 and FIRE-2 simulated satellite dwarfs around M31-like hosts show that some of these trends (dependence of SFH on satellite luminosity) are reproduced in the simulations while others (dependence of SFH on galactocentric distance, presence of the delayed-quenching population) are weaker or absent. We provide all photometric catalogs and SFHs as High-Level Science Products on MAST.   Keywords: Andromeda Galaxy — Dwarf Galaxies — Galaxy Evolution — Galaxy Quenching —   Our knowledge of low-mass galaxy formation has long been anchored by Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxies. Their demographics (i.e. numbers, luminosities, spatial configuration), kinematics, stellar abundance patterns, orbital histories, and star formation histories (SFHs) provide stringent tests of Cold Dark Matter (CDM), the physics of galaxy formation on the smallest scales, and the relationship between cosmic reionization and low- mass galaxies (e.g., Mateo et al. 1998; Simon & Geha 2007; Tolstoy et al. 2009; Kirby et al. 2013; Brown et al. 2014; Weisz et al. 2014a; Frebel & Norris 2015; Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin 2017; Simon 2019; Patel et al. 2020; Sacchi et al. 2021; Sales et al. 2022).   The progenitors of present-day MW satellite galaxies likely occupied a broadly representative volume in the very early Universe (z ∼ 7), but now the MW satellites reside in a highly biased region (e.g., Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2016). It remains unclear if the insights learned from MW satellites, and their particular formation path- ways, are applicable to other satellite systems and low- mass galaxies in general (e.g., Gandhi et al. 2024).   On the one hand, some present-day properties (e.g. luminosity function, quenched fraction) of the bright- est MW satellites are similar to other satellite systems   around MW-mass hosts in the Local Volume (e.g., Chi- boucas et al. 2013; Carlsten et al. 2022; Mao et al. 2021; Danieli et al. 2023; Mao et al. 2024; Geha et al. 2024). On the other hand, there are well-documented differ- ences in the properties (e.g. numbers, morphologies, spatial configurations, sizes, and SFHs) of satellites of the MW compared to those of M31, the closest L⋆ galaxy and the only other satellite system which can be ob- served to a comparable level of detail and faintness as the MW (e.g., McConnachie & Irwin 2006a; Brasseur et al. 2011; Tollerud et al. 2012; Monachesi et al. 2012; Conn et al. 2013; Ibata et al. 2013; Geha et al. 2015; Mar- tin et al. 2016; Geha et al. 2017; Skillman et al. 2017; D’Souza & Bell 2018; Greco et al. 2018; M¨uller et al. 2018; Pawlowski 2018; Smercina et al. 2018; Pawlowski et al. 2019; Doliva-Dolinsky et al. 2023; Savino et al. 2022, 2023). Whether these differences are the result of variance in the intrinsic nature of low-mass galaxy formation, due to the specific accretion histories of the MW and M31 (e.g., D’Souza & Bell 2021; Engler et al. 2021), or some other factor(s) is an open question that can only be resolved through systematic studies of low- mass satellite systems.   M31 and its satellites are an important frontier for ex- ploring the formation and evolution of low-mass satel- lites over cosmic time. With characteristic distances of ∼ 800 kpc (e.g., de Grijs & Bono 2014; Savino et al. 2022), it is possible to resolve M31 and its satellites   into individual stars with our most powerful ground- and space-based facilities. Resolved star studies of the M31 satellites enable measurements of SFHs, stellar abun- dance patterns, and proper motions to a level of preci- sion comparable to MW satellites (e.g., Williams et al. 2009; Hidalgo et al. 2011; Barker et al. 2011; Ho et al. 2012; Monachesi et al. 2012; Tollerud et al. 2012; Ho et al. 2015; Collins et al. 2013; Vargas et al. 2014; Weisz et al. 2014c; Geha et al. 2015; Monelli et al. 2016; Skill- man et al. 2017; van der Marel et al. 2019; Kirby et al. 2020; McQuinn et al. 2023; Sohn et al. 2020; Savino et al. 2023; Fu et al. 2024a).   For the foreseeable future (e.g. until large-aperture UV/optical space telescopes, such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, are deployed), M31 is the only satellite system that can be studied in comparable de- tail and completeness as the MW satellites. The next closest satellite systems around L⋆ hosts have distances of ∼3-4 Mpc. At such distances, measuring SFHs from the oldest main sequence turnoff (oMSTO; mI ≳ 31) is prohibitive (crowding, faintness) even with JWST (e.g., Savino et al. 2024), abundances of the red giant branch (RGB) stars are beyond even our most powerful spec- trographs currently in operation (e.g., Keck, VLT)1, and proper motions will require multi-decade time baselines. The enormous scientific potential for resolved star studies of the M31 satellites has been recognized for decades. Since the discovery of the first faint M31 satel- lites by van den Bergh (1972, 1974), there have been in- creasingly dedicated efforts to identify and characterize sub-structures (i.e., satellites and streams) around M31 through imaging (e.g., Ibata et al. 2001; Ferguson et al. 2002; McConnachie et al. 2003; Zucker et al. 2004a,b; Martin et al. 2006; McConnachie & Irwin 2006a,b; Ibata et al. 2007; Majewski et al. 2007; Zucker et al. 2007; Ir- win et al. 2008; McConnachie et al. 2008; Martin et al. 2009; McConnachie et al. 2009; Bell et al. 2011; Richard- son et al. 2011; Slater et al. 2011; Bernard et al. 2015b; Martin et al. 2016; Doliva-Dolinsky et al. 2022, 2023). In particular, the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Sur- vey (PAndAS) has been foundational for our knowledge of the M31 system. Using the CFHT, PAndAS under- took a deep, wide-area imaging survey out to a projected distance of 150 kpc from M31, resulting in the discovery of 16 M31 satellites as faint as MV ∼ −6, along with prominent streams, shells, globular clusters, and other stellar sub-structures (see McConnachie et al. 2018 and references therein). The discovery of new M31 satel-   lites continues apace with fainter, lower surface bright- ness, and/or more distant M31 satellites recently be- ing reported (e.g., Martin et al. 2013a,b; Collins et al. 2022b; Mart´ınez-Delgado et al. 2022; McQuinn et al. 2023; Collins et al. 2024).   There has been substantial effort to characterize the stellar populations and kinematics of the M31 satellites. First, the Keck telescope has played a central role in spectroscopic studies of the entire M31 system. With its excellent sensitivity and moderate resolution, large investments of Keck/DEIMOS time have provided ve- locities for thousands of stars throughout the M31 sys- tems, along with chemical abundances for a sizable frac- tion of these stars (e.g., Majewski et al. 2007; Kalirai et al. 2009, 2010; Collins et al. 2010; Tollerud et al. 2012; Howley et al. 2013; Vargas et al. 2014; Ho et al. 2015; Gilbert et al. 2019; Kirby et al. 2020; Wojno et al. 2020; Escala et al. 2021). These incredible spectroscopic datasets have provided dark matter halo mass estimates and radial velocities for most known M31 satellites (e.g., Tollerud et al. 2012; Collins et al. 2013), along with metallicities and detailed abundance patterns for the brighter systems (Vargas et al. 2014; Ho et al. 2015; Kirby et al. 2020; Wojno et al. 2020). Fainter M31 satellites are not as well characterized spectroscopically, primarily owing to the paucity of RGB stars in each sys- tem. More dedicated spectroscopy is required and/or al- ternative approaches to acquiring stellar chemistry are required for these faint systems (e.g., Fu et al. 2022, 2024a).   Second, the exquisite sensitivity and high angular res- olution of HST has been required for measuring SFHs and orbital histories. On the SFH side, only HST has had the ability to construct color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) that reach the oldest main sequence turnoff (oMSTO). Initially, shallower HST data revealed the presence of asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB) and red horizontal branches in many M31 satellites, sugges- tive of intermediate age star formation in many of these systems (e.g., Da Costa et al. 1996, 2000, 2002; Mar- tin et al. 2017). Given the significant integration times involved in reaching the oMSTO at ∼ 800 kpc, the mea- surement of ‘gold standard’ SFHs was a slow process with an early focus on M31, M33, and the bright ellipti- cal systems not found around the MW (M32, NGC 147, and NGC 185; Brown et al. 2006, 2008; Williams et al. 2009; Barker et al. 2011; Bernard et al. 2012; Monachesi et al. 2012; Bernard et al. 2015b,a; Geha et al. 2015) and an expansion to other, fainter systems in the mid-2010s. The first SFHs of faint M31 satellites based on MSTO- depth CMDs were from the Initial Star formation and Lifetimes of Andromeda Satellites (ISLAndS) program   (Weisz et al. 2014c; Monelli et al. 2016; Skillman et al. 2017). This ∼100 orbit HST program surveyed six M31 satellites that spanned a factor of ∼100 in luminosity. Perhaps the most remarkable finding from ISLAndS was the high degree of similarity in the SFHs of all six sys- tems. All formed ∼50% of their stellar mass ≳ 12 Gyr ago, while the remainder formed at intermediate ages, followed by nearly simultaneous quenching ∼ 5 − 6 Gyr ago. These trends were qualitatively different from those of MW satellites with similar properties (e.g., compara- ble luminosity, distance from host galaxy). However, the limited statistical power of six galaxies prohibited broader conclusions. A shallower HST survey of the re- mainder of the M31 satellites (Martin et al. 2017) hinted at similar trends across the M31 system, but the limited depth of the imaging resulted in large systematic uncer- tainties on the formal SFH measurements (Weisz et al. 2019).   HST imaging of M31 satellites that reaches the oM- STO is also well-suited for proper motion measurements. The astrometric stability, sensitivity, and angular reso- lution (for high fidelity point spread function characteri- zation and star-galaxy differentiation) of HST (and now JWST) is uniquely suited for these measurements. How- ever, to date, only M31, NGC 147, NGC 185, And III, and And VII have proper motions based on HST imag- ing (Sohn et al. 2012, 2020; Warfield et al. 2023; Casetti- Dinescu et al. 2024); proper motions based on other ob- servations (e.g., Gaia, VLBI) have been published for a handful of galaxies associated with the M31 system (Brunthaler et al. 2005, 2007; van der Marel et al. 2019; McConnachie et al. 2021; Battaglia et al. 2022; Bennet et al. 2024). Several HST and JWST programs are tar- geting the ISLAndS galaxies for PM measurements. As discussed at several points in this paper, a complete cen- sus of orbital histories for the M31 satellites is essential for unraveling the likely complex formation of the M31 system as we see it today.   The HST Survey of M31 Satellites Treasury program is a Cycle 27 program (GO-15902, PI:Weisz) that was designed to acquire oMSTO imaging for all known M31 satellites that lacked such data. The primary goals of the program are to (a) uniformly measure SFHs of the entire M31 satellite system; (b) determine homogenous RR Lyrae-based distances to all known M31 satellites; (c) provide first epoch proper motion imaging for the faint M31 satellites; and (d) provide the community with a uniformly reduced HST legacy photometric dataset for all new and archival observations of the M31 satellites. To date, this program has produced several signifi- cant results. First, Savino et al. (2022) uniformly mea- sured RR Lyrae distances to nearly all M31 satellites   and anchored them to the Gaia distance scale. This work resulted in a revision to the 3D geometry of the M31 satellite systems, affirmed the anisotropic spatial distribution of the satellites, and added new complexity into questions about the putative plane of M31 satellites. Second, Savino et al. (2023) presented SFHs of six ultra- faint dwarfs (UFDs) orbiting M31, the first oMSTO SFH of UFDs outside the MW halo. They show that while most systems are predominantly ancient, similar to MW UFDs, they tend to have longer periods of low-level star formation post-reionization and later quenching epochs. Savino et al. (2023) also present the SFH of And XIII, which formed a remarkable 75% of its stellar mass in a rapid burst ∼ 10 Gyr ago.   In this paper, we present an overview of our HST Sur- vey of M31 Satellites, and describe and release the pho- tometric data from > 1000 orbits of new and archival HST imaging. We then present the lifetime SFHs of all 36 satellites galaxies studied as part of this pro- gram along with redeterminations of SFHs for M31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream (GSS). The high- level science products (HLSPs) produced by this pro- gram are hosted on MAST and can be accessed here: https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/m31-satellites. We pro- vide a detailed description of the data products and their content in Appendix A.   This paper is organized as follows. We describe the observational strategy in §2. We detail our photometry and artificial star tests (ASTs), and present the CMDs of all galaxies in §3. We summarize our approach to SFH measurements in §4. We present the SFHs, and undertake a variety of science analyses with them, in §5. We present our conclusions in §6.   Our program was designed to target any known dwarf galaxy that, as of early 2019, fulfilled the following crite- ria: i) it is not in an advanced state of disruption (e.g., And XXVII, Collins et al. 2013; Preston et al. 2019, 2024); ii) it is located within ∼ 500 kpc (deprojected) of M31; iii) it does not already have deep HST imag- ing from other programs, though we do include those archival observations in our analysis (see § 2.3). This selection resulted in a sample of 24 targets, from which we excluded the galaxy IC 10, as its high line-of-sight extinction (AV = 4.5, Green et al. 2019) makes its oM- STO unreachable with HST. As of writing, there are a handful of additional galaxies, such as Peg W, Tri III, and And XXXIV, that are known to be associated with the M31 system (Collins et al. 2022a; Mart´ınez-Delgado et al. 2022; McQuinn et al. 2023; Collins et al. 2024,   Smith et al. submitted). However, these systems were discovered after our program was executed and were therefore not targeted by our survey. The final sam- ple of 23 galaxies observed by our program, along with a summary of the observations, is listed in Table 1.   For all new observations, we used the F606W and F814W filters on ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS. This fil- ter combination has a higher throughput, but reduced sensitivity to metallicity and effective temperature, com- pared to the F475W and F814W filters used by the LCID and ISLAndS programs. We designed our pro- gram assuming we would use informative priors on the age-metallicity relationship (AMR), which have been commonly used in SFH measurements of galaxies with CMDs of all depths, including those that include the oMSTO (e.g., Weisz et al. 2011, 2014a; McQuinn et al. 2015; Skillman et al. 2017; Albers et al. 2019; McQuinn et al. 2024b). These priors mitigate some of the reduced sensitivity to AMRs introduced by our filter choice, and, even in the case of the F475W and F814W filters, they help to reduce the effects of including poorly modeled foreground/background contamination in the SFH mea- surement.   Motivated by the observing strategy of Cole et al. (2014), our observations are designed to reach the sub- giant branch (SGB; MV + 3.2, MI ∼ +2.7) of an ancient (12 Gyr), metal-poor (∼[Fe/H] = -1.5) population with a SNR∼ 10 in both filters. This provides a slightly lower SNR (∼ 8) for the corresponding MSTO. Our simula- tions showed it to be sufficient for accurate SFH recov- ery, consistent with Cole et al. (2014). Simultaneously, we optimized the observational cadence for the detection of RR Lyrae in order to measure high-fidelity distances as discussed in Savino et al. (2022). Finally, the number of exposures and dithers used, as detailed in the public Phase II file, satisfied the astrometric requirements for first epoch proper motions.   We used ACS/WFC as our primary instrument and placed it near the center of each galaxy. WFC3/UVIS operated in parallel and sampled the outskirts, either providing a useful sampling of local background for mod- eling the CMDs of faint, compact galaxies or providing a second deep CMD for population gradient studies. We discuss the field placement more in §2.4 and §2.5.   Because of the large nature of the program, we were re- quired to follow the SCHED100 orbit duration protocol, which reduces the length of each orbit to accommodate HST scheduling pressure. Including this time constraint, we found that 244 prime and 244 parallel orbits would achieve our depth and cadence requirements. We note   that adopting F475W instead of F606W, for the same target depth, would have increased the total exposure time, and number of orbits, required to complete our survey by a factor of ∼ 3.   There are 13 dwarf galaxies within approximately 500 kpc of M31 that had HST imaging that reaches the oMSTO. We did not acquire new data for these systems and instead, we homogeneously re-analyze these data and include it in our final sample. With the exception of IC 10 and of very recent discoveries noted above, which do not possess deep HST photometry, the combination of our observations and the archival data comprises the entire known satellite galaxy system of M31. Here, we describe the archival data, which is also summarized in Table 1.   For And I, And II, And III, And XV, And XVI, and And XXVIII we use ACS/WFC3 and WFC3/UVIS imaging from the ISLAndS program (GO-13038, GO- 13739, PI: Skillman; Skillman et al. 2017). For And XIX, we use the ACS/WFC imaging from GO- 15302 (PI: Collins, Collins et al. 2022a). For NGC 147 and NGC 185, we use ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS imaging from GO-10794 and GO-11724 (PI: Geha, Geha et al. 2015), and additional observations from GO-14769 (PI: Sohn, Sohn et al. 2020). For M32 we use ACS/WFC imaging from GO-9392 (PI: Mateo) and GO-15658 (PI: Sohn). For IC 1613 and Psc I (also known as LGS3) we use ACS/WFC imaging from the LCID program (GO-1505, PI: Gallart, Hidalgo et al. 2011; Skillman et al. 2014; Gallart et al. 2015) and from GO-13738 (PI: Shaya). Finally, for the Pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy we use ACS/WFC imaging from GO-13768 (PI: Weisz, Cole et al. 2017).   Additionally, 15 galaxies in our sample have shallow ACS/WFC imaging from GO-13699 (PI: Martin, Martin et al. 2017). Although these observations only consist of one orbit of data per galaxy, all but one of these fields are spatially coincident with our deep ACS/WFC fields, and use the same filters, so we include those data in our reduction.   Figure 1 shows the placement of our primary ACS photometric fields on the 36 target dwarf galaxies in this paper (which we refer to as our primary sample). Most of the primary ACS fields observed by our program are placed to cover the photometric center of the target galaxy. The exceptions are NGC 205, And XXXI, and And XXXII, for which the field is placed off-center, due to crowding concerns. Additionally, the archival ACS   fields of NGC 147, NGC 185, M32, and IC 1613 are also offset from the galaxy center, to avoid the highly crowded inner regions.   Due to the different apparent sizes of our targets and to the different field placements, the primary ACS point- ings sample different fractions of the galaxy total stellar population. For each target, we have therefore calcu- lated the fraction of total stellar light contained in our ACS field. We do this by integrating a 2D exponential surface density profile (e.g., as described in Martin et al. 2016) over our ACS footprint. The only exceptions are NGC 147, NGC 185, NGC 205, and M32, for which we use a S´ersic profile (S´ersic 1963). We construct our pro- file using structural parameters (i.e., half-light radius, ellipticity, position angle and, where relevant, S´ersic in- dex) from the literature (Lee 1995; Choi et al. 2002; Mc- Connachie & Irwin 2006b; Bell et al. 2011; Slater et al. 2011; McConnachie 2012; Martin et al. 2013b,c; Crno- jevi´c et al. 2014; Martin et al. 2016). We refer to Savino et al. (2022) for further details.   The fraction of the total stellar light sampled by the ACS fields, which we call f⋆, is listed in Table 1. This varies from 99% for our most compact galaxy (And XX) to 2% for extended galaxies such as NGC 147, NGC 185 or And XIX.   the new observations of our program in- clude parallel WFC3/UVIS fields, mirroring the same F606W/F814W exposures of the primary ACS field. In addition, most of the dwarf galaxies with archival data have a deep parallel UVIS field (the exceptions being M32, IC 1613, and Psc I). However, due to the different apparent sizes of our sample galaxies, the parallel fields capture a variable amount of the targets’ stellar light, ranging from very populated fields in our large and lumi- nous targets (such as NGC 205) to fields showing few, if any, galaxy member stars in our most compact galaxies (such as And XX).   Figure 1 shows the placement of the parallel UVIS field in each target for which the images contain a mean- ingful amount of member stars (see § 3.4). Overall, we detect the target stellar population in the parallel field of 15 of the dwarf galaxies in our sample. In addition, the parallel field of And IX also contains a significant stellar population but this entirely belongs to the M31 halo, as discussed in Skillman et al. (2017).   While in this paper we present the observations and the photometry from the UVIS parallels, the analysis of the stellar populations in these fields, and a discussion of stellar population gradients in our target galaxies is deferred to a future paper (Garling et al, in prep.).   We complement our dwarf galaxy data by reducing and analyzing selected deep archival HST observations of the two large spiral galaxies in the M31 system, namely M33 and M31 itself, which we refer to as the auxiliary sample. Our motivation to include them is to provide homogeneous photometry and SFHs of these important central galaxies alongside the satellite popu- lation. The spatial position of the M33 and M31 fields is shown in Figure 2 and the observations are summarized in Table 2.   There are several deep HST fields targeting different regions of the M33 galaxy (e.g., Barker et al. 2007a; Williams et al. 2009; Barker et al. 2011; Bernard et al. 2012). We reduced and analyzed ACS/WFC imaging from eight pointings observed as part of GO-9837 (PI: Ferguson), GO-9873 (PI: Sarajedini) and GO-10190 (PI: Garnett). These observations sample the M33 disc at different radii, from 0.5 to 5 disc scale lengths from the center. Due to the large size and complex morphology of M33, jointly analyzing these data is the best way we have to obtain a global SFH that is more representative of M33 as a whole.   For M31, we choose to analyze two deep ACS fields in the stellar halo. As stellar halos are understood to carry the fossil imprint of past accretion events (e.g., Bullock & Johnston 2005; Belokurov et al. 2006, 2018; Helmi et al. 2018; Naidu et al. 2020; Deason & Belokurov 2024), these data will provide an instructive comparative benchmark to the properties of the satellites.   The first field, observed by GO-9453 (PI: Brown), tar- gets the inner smooth halo of M31, at a projected dis- tance of 11 kpc from its center. We only analyze roughly half of the 250 images acquired by ACS on this field. Even with this reduced dataset, this is the deepest pho- tometric field in our sample.   The other field, observed by GO-10265 (PI: Brown), targets the GSS, which is the most prominent tidal fea- ture of the M31 halo, hosts a stellar population that is representative of most of the inner halo substructures (e.g., Bernard et al. 2015b), and is one of the main manifestations of M31’s recent accretion history (e.g., McConnachie et al. 2018). As a caveat, we stress that both M31’s smooth halo and the GSS have very large apparent sizes and are known to have significant stellar population gradients (e.g., Ferguson et al. 2002; Gilbert et al. 2014; Conn et al. 2016; Cohen et al. 2018; Escala et al. 2020, 2021, 2023). An extensive analysis of the stellar populations in these two components is imprac- tical with the small FoV of ACS and it is not within the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, we deem useful to include these two datasets to enable a first-order com-   parison between the SFH of the satellites and that of the M31 spheroid.   We start the photometric reduction from the pre- reduced FLC frames, as retrieved from MAST. We re- duce the images using DOLPHOT (Dolphin 2000, 2016; Weisz et al. 2024), a popular point-spread-function (PSF) photometry package that has been used on many HST studies of nearby galaxies (e.g., Holtzman et al. 2006; Dalcanton et al. 2009; McQuinn et al. 2010; Mon- elli et al. 2010; Radburn-Smith et al. 2011; Dalcan- ton et al. 2012; Weisz et al. 2014a; Williams et al.   2014, 2021). We use the same DOLPHOT parameter set up established by the PHAT project (Dalcanton et al. 2012; Williams et al. 2014), which is well-optimized for crowded HST fields. While our dwarf fields are not as crowded as the PHAT observations of M31’s disk, test- ing on our images, and independent testing on a range of crowding regimes (e.g., Weisz et al. 2024), confirmed that this set-up is optimal to analyze our data. The only exception is the PSF-PhotIt parameter, which we set to 2. This choice adds a second iteration to the PSF photometry solution, refining the noise estimates and increasing completeness for faint sources.   After reduction, we cull the resulting photometric catalogs, to mitigate contamination from background   galaxies, cosmic rays, hot pixels, and other artifacts. This is done by selecting good sources on a number of photometry quality metrics. Namely we keep photomet- ric sources with:   • S/N ≥ 4 • Sharp2 ≤ 0.2 • Crowd ≤ 0.75 • Round ≤ 3   The quality metrics cuts are imposed on both filters simultaneously. The resulting photometric catalogs have a substantially higher level of purity. We illustrate this in Fig. 3, using And XI as an example. The comparison between the raw DOLPHOT catalog (panel A) and the culled catalog (panel B) shows that our selection criteria drastically reduces the amount of contaminant sources in the CMD.   3.2. Bright star masking   After culling the catalog using the quality metrics de- scribed above, a major remaining source of photometric contaminants consists of spurious sources detected in the diffraction spikes of bright stars and in stray-light   artifacts over the detector. We mitigate this effect by filtering our data through a series of spatial masks that cover the most obvious artifacts (see Fig. 4 for an exam- ple).   For each one of our fields, we obtain a list of bright stars by querying the Gaia database for all sources with G < 18, that are inside or immediately adjacent to our HST field of view. We inspect each source and we create a spatial mask that covers both the saturated core and any visible diffraction spike. The location, orientation, and size of the mask is manually adjusted for each star. We also mask diffraction spikes that arise from sources just outside our field of view. Finally, in some cases, there are bright stray-light artifacts obviously identifi- able in our images, which we also mask.   In Fig. 4 we provide an example of our masks for the And XI field, where all the features described above are visible. By removing the sources inside the masked re- gions, we further increase the purity of our photometric catalogs, as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (comparison between panel B and panel C).   For most sources in our sample, the target’s stellar population is the dominant contributor to source counts across the entire primary ACS FoV. However, for some of our most compact target galaxies, the bulk of the stellar population is concentrated in the central regions of the ACS detector, while the outer regions primar- ily contain contaminant sources. For the CMD analysis of this paper, we therefore impose a spatial cut on our catalogs, including only sources within 2rh from the tar- get’s photometric center (see Fig. 1 for a visual repre- sentation). We exclude M32, NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205 from this criterion, because their large stellar mass means that even regions at large radii contain a large population of galaxy member stars.   For most galaxies in our sample, their large angular size and the central positioning of the ACS fields mean that this spatial cut has no effect. However, for some of our faintest targets (MV > −9) these cuts signifi- cantly increase the purity of the stellar catalog, while only marginally decreasing the stellar counts from the target’s stellar population. This is shown for the case of And XI (MV = −6.4) by comparing panels C and D in Fig. 3. For those galaxies for which we reject sources   at r > 2rh, we have calculated updated f⋆ values and listed them (in parentheses) in Table 1.   Fig. 5 shows the ACS CMDs in our primary dwarf galaxy sample and highlights the depth and diversity of our dataset. In almost every target, the photometry reaches below the SGB and oMSTO per program con- struction. The galaxies show a remarkable diversity of CMDs, which imply a variety of formation histories, as we discuss in the context of formal SFH measurements. In terms of depth, two of the shallower datasets belong to M32 (archival) and NGC 205 (acquired through our program). In these two galaxies, despite long integra- tion times, the extreme crowding limits our photometric depth to F606W ∼ 28. While we still formally detect the SGB of a 13 Gyr stellar population, the incompleteness and photometric uncertainties at these magnitudes are considerably larger than for the rest of our targets. This limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting the oldest SFH of these two targets.   Fig. 6 shows the CMDs of the 15 UVIS parallel fields for which we detect dwarf galaxy member stars. They are not quite as deep as the ACS fields, as UVIS is less sensitive in the F814W band. Moreover, they exhibit a broad range of stellar densities. NGC 205 has the most populated UVIS CMD due to its high luminosity, large size, and the more central location of the UVIS field. The UVIS catalog of NGC 205 contains ∼345,000 sources compared to the ∼435,000 sources in the ACS field. Conversely, in the lower-luminosity And III, our UVIS field centered roughly at 2rh only contains a few hundred member stars, compared to ∼70,000 sources in the ACS field. With the exception of the And IX UVIS field, which contains a large population of M31 halo stars, all the UVIS fields not shown in Figure 6 are essentially empty, as they are dominated by back- ground galaxies and sparse populations of MW and/or M31 stars.   Finally, Fig. 7 shows the CMDs of the M31 and M33 fields. This figure shows the heterogeneity of these archival datasets. Both the M31 fields (Halo and GSS) are extremely deep, reaching more than 1 magnitude below the oMSTO. In M33, the more external photo- metric fields (D3, D4, S1, and S2) are also sufficiently deep to detect the oMSTO. However, as we move to inner regions (M9, U49, D2, and D1), crowding increas- ingly limits the photometric depth achievable. Also no- ticeable is the change in differential reddening, which is essentially absent for the outermost fields, and progres- sively increases when moving towards M33’s center.   We characterize the photometric completeness and the error distribution as a function of position on the CMD through the use of artificial star tests (ASTs). This tech- nique is the ‘gold standard’ to model photometric un- certainties in resolved stellar population studies, and is absolutely essential in crowded fields (e.g., Stetson 1987; Stetson & Harris 1988; Dalcanton et al. 2009; Weisz et al. 2014b; Williams et al. 2014; Savino et al. 2024).   For each of our ACS and WFC3 fields, we inject ∼ 5 × 105 synthetic stars in our images. Our input artificial stars are uniformly distributed across the ob- served CMD from ∼ 1 magnitude above the tip of the RGB to ∼ 2 mag below the detection limit. For the 36 dwarf galaxies in our primary sample, the ASTs are spa- tially distributed following the same 2D density profiles used to calculate f⋆. This choice allows us to capture the spatial variation in observational errors and com- pleteness due to crowding gradients. The ASTs for the M31 and M33 are uniformly distributed across the ACS fields.   We then repeat the DOLPHOT reduction procedure to measure the recovered photometric properties of our synthetic sources. To avoid modifying the crowding properties of the image, the injection and recovery steps are performed on one artificial star at a time. After reduction, the AST catalogs are processed through the exact cuts used for the photometric catalogs (i.e., qual- ity culling, bright star masking, and spatial cuts).   For each of our ACS photometric fields, we derive the SFH of the underlying stellar population through de- tailed modeling of the CMD density distribution, i.e., Hess diagrams. We do this using MATCH (Dolphin 2002), which is a software package designed to measure the SFH of a resolved stellar population by forward modeling the CMD with a combination of simple stellar population models. MATCH is a well-tested software that has been used in numerous studies of nearby stellar populations (e.g., Skillman et al. 2003; Williams et al. 2009; Mc- Quinn et al. 2010; Monelli et al. 2010; Weisz et al. 2011, 2014a; Lewis et al. 2015; McQuinn et al. 2015; Skillman et al. 2017). We briefly describe the specific assump- tions and configuration of our CMD models and refer the reader to the extensive tests carried out in Savino et al. (2023) regarding the effect of many of these as- sumption on measured SFHs.   We create stellar population models using stellar evo- lutionary tracks from the BaSTI theoretical grid (Hi-   dalgo et al. 2018; Pietrinferni et al. 2021, 2024). The stellar models we use include the effect of atomic diffu- sion, convective core overshooting, and use a Reimer’s mass-loss efficiency of η = 0.3. We use models with a scaled-solar α-element distribution, which is typical of CMD analysis in dwarf galaxies (Monelli et al. 2010; Skillman et al. 2017). Although spectroscopic investiga- tions of dwarfs in the M31 system revealed large varia- tions in stellar α-enhancement, both within individual dwarfs and across the satellite population (Vargas et al. 2014; Kirby et al. 2020), it has long been established that the choice of chemical mixture has a minor effect on the SFH of old stellar populations, especially if red broadband filters are used (e.g., Salaris et al. 1993; Cas- sisi et al. 2004; Savino et al. 2023). The exact α-element distribution adopted will have little impact on our SFHs.   We generate stellar population models over a grid spanning 7.50 ≤ log10(t/yr) ≤ 10.15, with a 0.05 dex resolution, and −3.0 < [F e/H] < 0, with a 0.1 dex resolution. We draw stars from a Kroupa initial mass function (Kroupa 2001), normalized between 0.08 M⊙ and 120 M⊙, and use an unresolved binary fraction of 0.35, with secondary masses drawn from a uniform mass ratio distribution. As demonstrated in Savino et al. (2023), all these assumptions do not have a strong im- pact on the recovered SFH. Consistent with previous nearby dwarf analyses (e.g., Weisz et al. 2014a; Skillman et al. 2017), we impose a physically motivated prior on the age-metallicity relation. During fitting, we impose that the mean metallicity must increase monotonically with time and we allow a modest metallicity dispersion (0.15 dex) in each age bin. This is a common choice to mitigate the age-metallicity degeneracy on the MSTO, and it is especially useful for the F606W/F814W filter pair, which has limited sensitivity to metallicity (see Ap- pendix B of Savino et al. 2023 for additional discussion on this assumption).   4.3. Distance and Extinction   We adopt homogeneous RR Lyrae distances from Savino et al. (2022). We set the MW foreground ex- tinction using the dust maps of Green et al. (2019). The only exceptions are M33 and IC 1613, which are not cov- ered by the Green et al. (2019) map, and for which we use extinction values from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011). For galaxies that have had recent star formation (i.e., Psc I, Peg DIG, IC 1613, and the photometric fields in M33), we apply two more extinction terms, in addi- tion to the MW foreground. The first one is an internal reddening term that applies to all stars in the stellar   population model. This term is intended to capture the diffuse dust content within the dwarf galaxy itself. We explore values of internal reddening ranging from 0 to dAV = 2 mag, in steps of 0.1 mag, and adopt the value that results in the best CMD goodness-of-fit parameter. Only the M33 fields are found to require a dAV greater than zero and the best fit values are listed in Table 12. The second term is a uniformly distributed differential extinction term that only applies to stars younger than 100 Myr and is intended to capture the extinction of the dense natal environments of these stars. Following Dol- phin et al. (2003), this second extinction term is set to a differential extinction of dAV = 0 at 100 Myr and lin- early increased to a maximum value of dAV = 0.5 mag for stars younger than 40 Myr. Given that most of our targets have virtually no amount of recent star for- mation, the impact of this assumption is expected to be negligible in most cases. For the few actively star- forming galaxies in our sample, choices on this extra ex- tinction term only meaningfully affect the SFH within the last 500 Myr. Even for star-forming dwarfs, only 1- 3% of the total stellar mass is formed in this time span (see § 5), so this assumption has a small impact unless in applications where the details of the most recent SFH are of particular interest.   The stellar population models are convolved with ob- servational effects (photometric errors and incomplete- ness) measured by the ASTs described in § 3.5. Both ob- served and model CMDs are converted to density maps using bins of 0.05 mag in color and 0.1 mag in apparent magnitude. We fit the CMD from approximately 1 mag above the tip of the RGB, to a magnitude that corre- sponds to the 50% completeness level as listed in Tabs. 1 and 2. The only exceptions are those fields for which the 50% completeness limit does not reach the oMSTO and for which we extend our modeling to fainter magnitudes. In particular, for Peg DIG and for the D2, D3, D4, M9, and U49 fields of M33 we model down to the 30% com- pleteness level. For the severely crowded fields of M32, NGC 205 and the D1 field of M33, we model the entirety of the CMD down to the detection limit. In all of our targets, we exclude the CMD region around the horizon- tal branch, to mitigate the accuracy issues of models of this evolutionary phase. As mentioned above, the oldest age SFHs measured from CMDs that extend below the 50% completeness limit should be treated with appro- priate caution.   4.5. Contamination Model While the procedure outlined in § 3 lets us reject a large fraction of contaminant sources, our photometric   catalogs still contain sources that are not genuine mem- ber stars of our targets. In particular, unresolved back- ground galaxies are a major source of contamination at the magnitude of the oMSTO (e.g., Warfield et al. 2023). We address this issue by building a contamination model that is added to our stellar population models during the CMD fit.   Ideally, each ACS field has a WFC3/UVIS parallel that could be used as a control field to build the con- tamination model. In practice, most UVIS parallels are not suitable either because they contain a substantial number of member stars (in our most extended targets) or because they are so sparse that the reduction does not yield reliable photometry.   We instead choose representative, well-reduced, UVIS fields to build a contamination model for all the galaxies in our sample. For the F606W/F814W data, we use the parallel field of And XXX, while for the F475W/F814W data we use the parallel field of And XV. For these two fields, we convert the CMD to a density map, which is smoothed with a 5 × 5 bin kernel. This density field is added to the stellar population model density during the CMD fit. As part of the CMD optimization process, we allow the code to fit a scale factor for the background model along with the stellar population parameters.   The only exceptions to this approach are the CMDs of And I, And IX, and M32. They each contain sub- stantial contamination from M31 halo stars. For these galaxies, we create a custom contamination model. The contamination model for And IX is built using the whole UVIS field from its own parallel, which only contains M31 stars. Similar to Skillman et al. (2017), for And I we only use a cut-out (r > 3rh) of the UVIS parallel field, chosen to minimize the number of stars from And I itself. For M32, we use an ACS control field, adjacent to M32, observed as part of program GO-9392.   Once we obtain the best-fit SFH, we calculate the un- certainties following the prescription of Dolphin (2012) and Dolphin (2013), which is a common choice in stud- ies of nearby galaxies (e.g., Weisz et al. 2014a; Skill- man et al. 2017). The statistical uncertainties on the star formation rates are obtained by sampling the solu- tion parameter space with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm (Duane et al. 1987). The systematic uncer- tainties are estimated by perturbing the stellar model library with shifts in effective temperature and lumi- nosity. We produce 100 perturbed stellar model grids and use the dispersion in the SFH solutions to calcu- late the systematic uncertainties. As demonstrated in Savino et al. (2023), not only does this method provide   a good representation of the systematics associated with the stellar model library, but it also captures the SFH variation associated with other common sources of un- certainties (e.g., distance, extinction, α-enhancement).   Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the cumulative SFHs for our primary sample of 36 dwarfs and for our M31/M33 fields, respectively. The corresponding star formation rates vs. lookback time are shown in Appendix B. We report the SFH of the M31 Halo field and that of the GSS sepa- rately. We obtain the SFH of M33 by an unweighted sum of the SFRs of the eight M33 fields (which corresponds to a mass-weighted sum of the cumulative SFHs). SFHs for the individual M33 fields are shown in Appendix C. For most targets, our measurements are the first SFHs obtained from oMSTO photometry. However, roughly 30% of our sample (roughly corresponding to the archival fields) have previous SFH determination from deep photometry (e.g., Skillman et al. 2003; Brown et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2009; Hidalgo et al. 2011; Bernard et al. 2012; Monachesi et al. 2012; Geha et al.   2015; Skillman et al. 2017; Collins et al. 2022b). In Ap- pendix D, we provide a comparison between our SFHs and some of these previous literature results. Overall, there is good agreement between our SFHs and litera- ture SFHs, with minor discrepancies due to choices in stellar models, distance, and/or extinction.   We now take advantage of our large and homoge- neous SFH compilation to analyze the star formation timescales of the M31 satellites on a population level, both as a function of other satellite properties and in comparison to the MW satellite population.   5.1. The Effect of Spatial Coverage   HST’s field of view only covers part of most galaxies. In this analysis, we assume that the SFHs measured from each ACS field are representative of the whole It is important to acknowledge the potential galaxy. limitations of this assumption. Our observations only cover a certain fraction of the galaxy’s stellar mass (ap- proximately equal to f⋆ in Table 1, assuming small radial variations in mass-to-light ratio), typically close to the galaxy’s center.   Both theory (e.g., El-Badry et al. 2016; Graus et al. 2019) and observations (e.g., Harbeck et al. 2001; Tol- stoy et al. 2004; Battaglia et al. 2006; Hidalgo et al. 2013; Savino et al. 2019; Taibi et al. 2022; Fu et al. 2024b,a) find stellar population gradients in many low- mass galaxies. SFHs measured from a limited field of view may therefore be biased relative to a SFH of the en- tire galaxy (Graus et al. 2019). Given that our fields tar- get the galaxy centers, and that the most recent star for- mation is typically more spatially concentrated in low- mass galaxies, the effect of incomplete spatial coverage is expected to be more important in our measurement involving old ages (e.g., median star formation epochs), and less impactful on estimates of the quenching epoch (Graus et al. 2019). There is no clear way to eliminate this source of bias without a prohibitive investment of HST/JWST time. Measuring SFHs over the full spa- tial extent of nearby galaxies is better suited for wide field-of-view space telescopes such as Euclid or Roman. The effect of limited spatial coverage varies substan- tially across the sample. For 15 of our 36 dwarf galaxy targets, our ACS field contains more than 50% of the total stellar mass, meaning that, while stellar popula- tion gradients can still impact our measurements, our SFH can still be taken as reasonably representative of the whole galaxy. For spatially larger galaxies, our ACS fields can contain as little as a few percent of the total stellar mass and stellar population gradients can have a larger impact. Many of our most massive galaxies have parallel WFC3/UVIS observations that can be used to   constrain the presence of age gradients, which we plan to explore in a forthcoming paper (Garling et al., in prep.). Our limited spatial coverage is most impactful in our three auxiliary targets: M33, the GSS, and the M31 halo. These stellar systems have large angular sizes, can host important stellar population gradients (e.g., Williams et al. 2009; Gilbert et al. 2014; Conn et al. 2016; Escala et al. 2020, 2021, 2023, see Appendix C), and, in the case of M33, have a complex morphology. The SFHs presented in this paper should not be inter- preted as a characterization of the global SFH of these systems. Rather, they represent the best that is possible given the piecemeal nature of archival HST data. They are included to provide a homogeneously measured point of comparison to the properties of the satellite popula- tion.   5.2. Identifying the Quenching Epoch   A particularly important timescale in a galaxy’s SFH is its quenching epoch, i.e., the lookback time at which star formation activity ceased completely. However, ex- tracting this information from CMD-based SFHs is sur- prisingly challenging (e.g., Skillman et al. 2017; Savino et al. 2023). Beyond physical mechanisms that initiate galaxy quenching, there are a number of observational contaminants that can introduce low levels of late star formation in CMD-based SFHs, which affect estimation of the quenching epoch.   One such source are blue-straggler stars. On an opti- cal CMD, they can mimic recent star formation activity at the level of a few percent of the total stellar mass (e.g., Mapelli et al. 2007; Momany et al. 2007; Monelli et al. 2012). Other effects, such as imperfect modeling of the foreground/background population and residual photo- metric artifacts, can also introduce noise in the SFH, pushing the complete end of star formation to younger ages.   For these reasons, it is common practice to use met- rics such as τ90 (i.e., the lookback time at which 90% of the total star formation occurs), to approximately trace star formation quenching while mitigating the above concerns about contamination (e.g., Weisz et al. 2014b; Skillman et al. 2017; Weisz et al. 2019). While this might be an appropriate choice for relatively luminous dwarfs, there is the possibility that it is not sufficiently conserva- tive for low-mass dwarfs, as their sparse CMDs are more susceptible to contaminants such as background galax- ies, especially if the SNR at the oMSTO is relatively low, as is the case for some of our faint systems.   To mitigate this, we also calculate and adopt the more conservative metric τ80 (i.e., the lookback time at which 80% of the total star formation occurs). Other studies   have shown this to be a more robust tracer of quenching in the faintest galaxies such as UFDs (e.g., Savino et al. 2023; McQuinn et al. 2024a). The trade-off of a more conservative metric is that it can miss genuine late star formation in brighter dwarfs, which also tend to have more extended SFHs.   Given that our galaxy sample spans 11 magnitudes in luminosity, it is challenging to adopt a single quenching metric for all systems. Instead, we adopt the quench- i) τ90 for quenched dwarfs ing metric τq defined as: with MV < −8, ii) τ80 for quenched dwarfs with MV > −8, iii) 0 for those galaxies with active star formation (Peg DIG, IC 1613, and M33). We find this to be a rea- sonable compromise to balance the purity versus com- pleteness concerns outlined above. We realize that this choice introduces a degree of heterogeneity that might complicate comparisons with other results. Accordingly, in appendix E we show our results in terms of only τ80 or τ90. We provide all the star formation timescales dis- cussed in this paper in Table 3.   5.3. Trends with Luminosity   Fig. 10 shows the values of τ50 (i.e., the lookback time when 50% of the total star formation is reached) and τq, as a function of absolute luminosity (from Savino et al. 2022) for our sample of 36 dwarf galaxies. Shown on the plot are also the measurements for M33 (white star), the GSS (dotted line), and the M31 halo (dashed line).   We find a clear correlation between MV and both τ50 and τq such that more luminous galaxies build their stellar mass over longer periods and quench at later times. The Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.46 for the trend with τ50 and 0.76 for the trend with τq. Ear- lier studies of the 6 M31 ISLAndS satellites (Skillman et al. 2017) did not detect any significant trend, despite having nearly identical SFHs to ours. This highlights the increased statistical power of our larger sample.   The mixed degree of spatial coverage provided by HST complicates interpretation of these trends. Given that all of our targets are at similar distances, there is a strong correlation between the galaxy’s luminosity and f⋆. In the presence of significant age gradients, the stel- lar ages inferred for the bright galaxies in our sample would be biased young (due to the central position of our ACS fields), compared to the total SFH of the sys- tem (Graus et al. 2019).   Despite this observational bias, there are two reasons to expect that this trend is driven by physics. First, such a correlation between galaxy luminosity and star formation duration is also seen in MW satellites (e.g., Weisz et al. 2014a; Skillman et al. 2017) for which spa- tial selection effects are more complicated than a simple",

Movements such as Formalism and Structural-\nism in the 20th century explored the mechanics of sto-\nrytelling, emphasizing recurring patterns and struc-\ntures. Pioneering works like Propp’s analysis of Rus-\nsian folktales (Propp, 2012) and Todorov’s structural\nanalysis (Todorov and Weinstein, 1969) established\nframeworks that continue to inform both theoretical\nand computational methods for narrative understand-\ning. In recent years, advances in natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) and machine learning have expanded\nthe scope of computational narrative studies (Piper\net al., 2021).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n2.1 Advances in Computational\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nNarrative Analysis\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nEarly computational methods, including Support Vec-\ntor Machines (Hearst et al., 1998) and logistic regres-\nsion (Vimal, 2020), struggled to capture the complex\nrelationships and temporal dynamics inherent in nar-\nratives (Young et al., 2018). The advent of deep learn-\ning, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs)\nand convolutional neural networks (CNNs), marked\nsignificant progress by enabling the modeling of se-\nquential and local features in text (Yin et al., 2017).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTransformer-based models, such as GPT (Rad-\nford, 2018) and BERT (Vaswani, 2017), further rev-\nolutionized the field with self-attention mechanisms\nthat capture long-range text dependencies. These\nmodels leverage embeddings to represent semantic\nrelationships mathematically, enabling deeper narra-\ntive understanding and generation (Haywood et al.,\n2024). More recently, Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion (RAG) has improved narrative interpretation by\nintegrating external knowledge sources (Lewis et al.,\n2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nof Narratives\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nMethods like sentiment analysis and topic model-\ning have been used to identify emotional arcs and\nthematic progressions in narratives (Reagan et al.,\n2016; ?). However, advanced models are needed to\naddress non-linear temporal dynamics and complex\nstory turning points (Piper and Toubia, 2023). Con-\ncepts such as narrative flow, suspense, and causality\nremain underexplored despite their importance for au-\ndience engagement (Wilmot and Keller, 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTelevision series, with their layered and evolving\nstorylines, pose unique challenges for narrative analy-\nsis. Unlike standalone stories, TV series often feature\narcs spanning multiple episodes or seasons, requir-\ning robust methods to identify and track these con-\nnections (Mittell, 2015). While NLP techniques have\nbeen employed to extract narrative elements and char-\nacter interactions (Dalla Torre et al., 2023; Janosov,\n2021; Bost et al., 2016), these methods often rely\non significant manual effort (Rocchi and Pescatore,\n2022).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2.3 Multi-Agent Systems in Narrative\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nUnderstanding\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown poten-\ntial in narrative generation and analysis (Zhao et al.,\n2023). Multi-agent systems (MAS) further enhance\nthese capabilities by enabling collaborative task pro-\ncessing. MAS have been used to advance fields such\nas legal reasoning (Yuan et al., 2024) and scien-\ntific theory development (Ghafarollahi and Buehler,\n2024), as well as narrative generation (Aoki et al.,\n2023).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nBy assigning specialized tasks to individual\nagents, MAS facilitate the extraction of narrative arcs\nand the tracking of their progression across episodes,\nmaking them well-suited for analyzing serialized nar-\nratives.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n2.4 Narrative Arcs (Plotlines)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTV series diverge significantly from the classical nar-\nration model, relying on networks of interconnected\nstorylines rather than single linear plots (P´erez and\nOrtiz, 2021). Serialized narratives operate through a\nmulti-layered structure that evolves across episodes\nand seasons, creating a unique sense of depth and\ncontinuity (Pescatore and Rocchi, 2019; Rocchi and\nPescatore, 2022; Degli Esposti and Pescatore, 2023).\nNarrative arcs in TV series can be categorized\ninto Anthology Plots, which resolve within a sin-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\ngle episode, and Running Plots, which span multi-\nple episodes or seasons. Running Plots include Soap\nPlots, focusing on character relationships, and Genre-\nSpecific Plots, tied to the show’s thematic or profes-\nsional elements, such as survival challenges in a zom-\nbie series.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThese categories build on the framework outlined\nin (Pescatore and Rocchi, 2019), which uses the con-\ncept of isotopy to ensure textual coherence (Greimas\net al., 1982). Episodic isotopies define Anthology\nPlots, interpersonal and intrapersonal isotopies sus-\ntain Soap Plots, and thematic isotopies characterize\nGenre-Specific Plots.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo generalize this framework beyond medical dra-\nmas, where Running Plots were initially defined as\nSentimental and Professional Plots (Pescatore and\nRocchi, 2019), we propose broader definitions appli-\ncable to other serialized genres.\n**BLOCK**fs== 13.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3 MODELING NARRATIVE ARCS\n**BLOCK**fs== 13.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nFOR STORING\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo analyze and document these arcs effectively, we\nconceptualized a model that captures their key at-\ntributes and episodic progressions in a structured for-\nmat. Each arc is categorized into one of three types\nbased on its nature and scope:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• Anthology Arcs, which are self-contained stories\nresolved within a single episode, often centered\non genre-specific events or cases.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• Genre-Specific Arcs, focusing on professional or\nthematic elements tied to the series, such as work-\nplace dynamics or medical conflicts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• Soap Arcs, which explore interpersonal relation-\nships, personal growth, and emotional conflicts.\nEach arc is defined by a title and description that\nencapsulates its central theme or conflict. The main\ncharacters driving the arc are identified, along with\nthe arc type, which provides context for its role within\nthe series. To track how arcs evolve over time, we\ndocument their progressions, which capture episodic\ndevelopments relevant to each storyline. A progres-\nsion specifies the episode and season where it occurs,\nthe interfering characters influencing the arc in that\ncontext, and a concise description of the events ad-\nvancing the storyline.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nSummarizing, in our system, the object Narrative\nArc includes several fields. Each arc is assigned a\nunique identifier (arc id), along with a title and de-\nscription encapsulating its central theme or conflict.\nThe arcs also contain progressions, which are a list of\nProgression objects representing their developments\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nacross episodes. Additionally, each arc identifies the\nmain characters driving the storyline, specifies the arc\ntype (Anthology, Soap, or Genre-Specific), and indi-\ncates the series to which it belongs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nEach Progression is similarly structured with key\nattributes. It is assigned a unique identifier (progres-\nsion id) and is linked to its corresponding narrative\narc through the arc id. The progression includes a\ndescription of the events related to the arc in the spe-\ncific episode (Content), as well as information about\nthe series, season, and episode in which it occurs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 13.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n4 TECHNICAL DETAILS\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this paper, ”LLM” refers specifically to the Ope-\nnAI GPT-4o model, accessed via API.

The spaCy Transformer model was\nused to extract character entities, and the LLM further\nrefined this output by resolving similar names and al-\nternative appellations. A character database was cre-\nated, containing unique identifiers, preferred names,\nand alternative names for each character. The plots\nwere then standardized by replacing all character ref-\nerences with their preferred names.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n5.4 Season Plot Generation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo create a cohesive season-level summary, individ-\nual episode plots were first summarized using the\nLLM.

The\nmulti-agent system introduced represents a step to-\nward automating the traditionally manual process of\nidentifying and organizing narrative arcs for deeper\nstudy.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWhile the results are promising, they also reveal\nlimitations, particularly the reliance on textual para-\ntexts, such as episode summaries, as the primary in-\nput. Summaries focus on major plot-driving events,\nneglecting subtle details found in visuals, dialogue,\nor other storytelling layers. Consequently, the system\noccasionally misses overlapping arcs or blends dis-\ntinct storylines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nHowever, this limitation also presents an oppor-\ntunity. The system is particularly well-suited for se-\nrialized written narratives, where all story elements\nare text-based. Serialized novels, episodic web fic-\ntion, and other text-driven storytelling formats elim-\ninate the multimodal challenges of TV series, offer-\ning a clearer field for arc extraction and progression\nmapping. With minor adjustments, the workflow can\nbe adapted to handle chapters, segments, or seman-\ntic chunks of text (Qu et al., 2024), treating them as\n”episodes” to track storylines over an extended series.\nFuture work will enhance the system by integrat-\ning richer inputs such as subtitles, scene descriptions,\nand multimodal data. Refinements to the multi-agent\nsystem are also needed to improve reliability, particu-\nlarly in managing overlapping arcs and deduplication.\nExpanding testing across diverse genres will further\nrefine the system’s versatility and applicability.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nUltimately, the combination of automation and\nhuman oversight remains indispensable.

The analysis of narrative structure has long been a fo- cus of inquiry in both literary studies and media anal- ysis. From Formalism and Structuralism to the more contemporary methodologies of Classical and Post- Classical Narratology, the study of narrative has cen- tered on understanding the underlying relationships and components that constitute storytelling (Ionescu, 2019). The process of narrative understanding mir- rors other forms of comprehension: it involves iden- tifying constituent elements and integrating them into a coherent whole.   Television series pose unique challenges, with sto- rylines interweaving over seasons, resisting straight- forward categorization (Mittell, 2015). These ”nar- rative arcs” are not singular or linear but distributed across episodes and interconnected with other story- lines. Some arcs conclude within an episode, while others develop gradually, spanning seasons. Under- standing these patterns requires approaches that can identify connections and developments across diverse   This paper introduces a multi-agent system de- signed to assist in the extraction and mapping of nar- rative arcs from serialized television content. The system parses episode summaries to identify arcs and their progressions, categorizing them into types such as self-contained, interpersonal, or genre-specific arcs. These arcs are stored in a relational database and enriched with semantic embeddings in a vector database. To test the system, we analyzed the first sea- son of Grey’s Anatomy (ABC 2005-), comparing the extracted arcs to those identified by a human scholar familiar with the series.   The remainder of this paper is organized as fol- lows. Section 2 situates this study within the broader context of narrative analysis and computational meth- ods. Section 3 introduces the conceptual framework for modeling and storing narrative arcs. Section 4 describes the technical infrastructure supporting the system. Section 5 outlines the data collection and preprocessing pipeline of the episodes’ plots. Sec- tion 6 presents the multi-agent framework for extract- ing and organizing narrative arcs. Section 7 explores the graphical interface designed to facilitate human oversight and refinement of the system’s outputs. Sec-   tion 8 evaluates the system’s performance, discusses its strengths and limitations, while 9 closes the paper identifying potential improvement.

The study of narrative structures and their evolution has been a foundational area of research across disci- plines, from literary theory to computational linguis- tics. Movements such as Formalism and Structural- ism in the 20th century explored the mechanics of sto- rytelling, emphasizing recurring patterns and struc- tures. Pioneering works like Propp’s analysis of Rus- sian folktales (Propp, 2012) and Todorov’s structural analysis (Todorov and Weinstein, 1969) established frameworks that continue to inform both theoretical and computational methods for narrative understand- ing. In recent years, advances in natural language pro- cessing (NLP) and machine learning have expanded the scope of computational narrative studies (Piper et al., 2021).   2.1 Advances in Computational   Early computational methods, including Support Vec- tor Machines (Hearst et al., 1998) and logistic regres- sion (Vimal, 2020), struggled to capture the complex relationships and temporal dynamics inherent in nar- ratives (Young et al., 2018). The advent of deep learn- ing, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), marked significant progress by enabling the modeling of se- quential and local features in text (Yin et al., 2017).   Transformer-based models, such as GPT (Rad- ford, 2018) and BERT (Vaswani, 2017), further rev- olutionized the field with self-attention mechanisms that capture long-range text dependencies. These models leverage embeddings to represent semantic relationships mathematically, enabling deeper narra- tive understanding and generation (Haywood et al., 2024). More recently, Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion (RAG) has improved narrative interpretation by integrating external knowledge sources (Lewis et al., 2020).   of Narratives   Methods like sentiment analysis and topic model- ing have been used to identify emotional arcs and thematic progressions in narratives (Reagan et al., 2016; ?). However, advanced models are needed to address non-linear temporal dynamics and complex story turning points (Piper and Toubia, 2023). Con- cepts such as narrative flow, suspense, and causality remain underexplored despite their importance for au- dience engagement (Wilmot and Keller, 2020).   Television series, with their layered and evolving storylines, pose unique challenges for narrative analy- sis. Unlike standalone stories, TV series often feature arcs spanning multiple episodes or seasons, requir- ing robust methods to identify and track these con- nections (Mittell, 2015). While NLP techniques have been employed to extract narrative elements and char- acter interactions (Dalla Torre et al., 2023; Janosov, 2021; Bost et al., 2016), these methods often rely on significant manual effort (Rocchi and Pescatore, 2022).   2.3 Multi-Agent Systems in Narrative   Large language models (LLMs) have shown poten- tial in narrative generation and analysis (Zhao et al., 2023). Multi-agent systems (MAS) further enhance these capabilities by enabling collaborative task pro- cessing. MAS have been used to advance fields such as legal reasoning (Yuan et al., 2024) and scien- tific theory development (Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2024), as well as narrative generation (Aoki et al., 2023).   By assigning specialized tasks to individual agents, MAS facilitate the extraction of narrative arcs and the tracking of their progression across episodes, making them well-suited for analyzing serialized nar- ratives.   TV series diverge significantly from the classical nar- ration model, relying on networks of interconnected storylines rather than single linear plots (P´erez and Ortiz, 2021). Serialized narratives operate through a multi-layered structure that evolves across episodes and seasons, creating a unique sense of depth and continuity (Pescatore and Rocchi, 2019; Rocchi and Pescatore, 2022; Degli Esposti and Pescatore, 2023). Narrative arcs in TV series can be categorized into Anthology Plots, which resolve within a sin-   gle episode, and Running Plots, which span multi- ple episodes or seasons. Running Plots include Soap Plots, focusing on character relationships, and Genre- Specific Plots, tied to the show’s thematic or profes- sional elements, such as survival challenges in a zom- bie series.   These categories build on the framework outlined in (Pescatore and Rocchi, 2019), which uses the con- cept of isotopy to ensure textual coherence (Greimas et al., 1982). Episodic isotopies define Anthology Plots, interpersonal and intrapersonal isotopies sus- tain Soap Plots, and thematic isotopies characterize Genre-Specific Plots.   To generalize this framework beyond medical dra- mas, where Running Plots were initially defined as Sentimental and Professional Plots (Pescatore and Rocchi, 2019), we propose broader definitions appli- cable to other serialized genres.   To analyze and document these arcs effectively, we conceptualized a model that captures their key at- tributes and episodic progressions in a structured for- mat. Each arc is categorized into one of three types based on its nature and scope:   • Anthology Arcs, which are self-contained stories resolved within a single episode, often centered on genre-specific events or cases.   • Genre-Specific Arcs, focusing on professional or thematic elements tied to the series, such as work- place dynamics or medical conflicts.   • Soap Arcs, which explore interpersonal relation- ships, personal growth, and emotional conflicts. Each arc is defined by a title and description that encapsulates its central theme or conflict. The main characters driving the arc are identified, along with the arc type, which provides context for its role within the series. To track how arcs evolve over time, we document their progressions, which capture episodic developments relevant to each storyline. A progres- sion specifies the episode and season where it occurs, the interfering characters influencing the arc in that context, and a concise description of the events ad- vancing the storyline.   Summarizing, in our system, the object Narrative Arc includes several fields. Each arc is assigned a unique identifier (arc id), along with a title and de- scription encapsulating its central theme or conflict. The arcs also contain progressions, which are a list of Progression objects representing their developments   across episodes. Additionally, each arc identifies the main characters driving the storyline, specifies the arc type (Anthology, Soap, or Genre-Specific), and indi- cates the series to which it belongs.   Each Progression is similarly structured with key attributes. It is assigned a unique identifier (progres- sion id) and is linked to its corresponding narrative arc through the arc id. The progression includes a description of the events related to the arc in the spe- cific episode (Content), as well as information about the series, season, and episode in which it occurs.   In this paper, ”LLM” refers specifically to the Ope- nAI GPT-4o model, accessed via API. Data storage was implemented using an SQLite database, while embeddings were generated with the Cohere-embed- english-v3.0 model and stored in a Chroma vector database. The backend was developed in Python (ver- sion 3.11), with FastAPI facilitating communication between the backend and frontend, which was built using the React JavaScript framework. Character en- tities were extracted from episode plots using the Spacy NLP model en core web trf.   Our software was designed to be generalizable across various TV series genres. For testing, we focused on the first season of Grey’s Anatomy, a choice motivated by our team’s prior research on medical dramas. This familiarity provided a solid foundation for evaluating the software’s performance. The system requires only episode summaries of a season to function effectively.   To develop and test the software, we sourced episode summaries from the fan-maintained Grey’s Anatomy Wiki (https://greysanatomy.fandom.com), which op- erates under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License (CC BY-SA). This license permits re- search and commercial use with proper attribution. The raw data was preprocessed to ensure standard- ization and usability for analysis.   The preprocessing began with cleaning and simpli- fying the episode summaries. Using the LLM, sen- tences were rewritten in simpler, more structured forms, emphasizing clarity by focusing on a single character or event per sentence. Direct quotations were avoided, and complex sentence structures were replaced with concise descriptions. This process en- sured the plots were easily interpretable and consis- tent.   Character name variability was addressed by replac- ing pronouns with corresponding character names, guided by contextual analysis within a fifteen- sentence window. The spaCy Transformer model was used to extract character entities, and the LLM further refined this output by resolving similar names and al- ternative appellations. A character database was cre- ated, containing unique identifiers, preferred names, and alternative names for each character. The plots were then standardized by replacing all character ref- erences with their preferred names.   To create a cohesive season-level summary, individ- ual episode plots were first summarized using the LLM. These summaries were then concatenated and further summarized to produce a streamlined narra- tive overview of the season. This two-step process ensured the essential details of the narrative were re- tained while providing a comprehensive summary.   This preprocessing pipeline transformed raw tex- tual data into a structured format, enabling detailed narrative analysis and ensuring the software’s appli- cability across various TV series genres.   The narrative arc extraction process utilizes a multi- It iden- agent system to analyze the episode plots. tifies, categorizes, and refines narrative arcs, inte- grating episodic storylines into a cohesive seasonal framework. The workflow is sequential, with spe- cialized agents performing tasks. The resulting arcs and their progressions are stored in both a relational database and a vector database, as detailed in Section 6.2. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the system.   The extraction workflow is divided into stages, with each stage handled by an autonomous agent. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of narrative analy- sis, ensuring arcs are both episode-specific and sea- sonally coherent. Results from prior episodes are in- corporated to maintain continuity and account for the evolving nature of serialized storytelling.   6.1.1 Agent 1 - Existing Season Arcs Identifier   This agent evaluates if arcs from previous episodes (if present) are present in the current episode. If detected, they are flagged as ”possibly present” and serve as reference points for subsequent agents.   6.1.2 Agent 2 - Anthology Arc Extractor   This agent identifies self-contained, standalone story- lines unique to the current episode. These arcs are processed independently, as they do not contribute to season-wide continuity.   6.1.3 Agent 3 - Soap and Genre-Specific Arc   This agent analyzes the episode plot to identify new soap and genre-specific arcs and to validate arcs flagged by Agent 1.   6.1.4 Agent 4 - Seasonal Arc Optimizer   This agent minimizes redundancy by analyzing soap It performs and genre-specific arcs for overlaps.   stricter checks on ”possibly present” season arcs and newly identified arcs, merging or refining them as needed to maintain distinct scopes.   6.1.5 Agent 5 - Arc Deduplicator   All arcs extracted from the episode, including Anthol- ogy Arcs, are reviewed for similarity. Overlapping arcs are resolved through a disambiguation process. For example, arcs identified as both Anthology and Genre-Specific by separate agents are clarified by this deduplicator.   6.1.6 Agent 6 - Detail Enhancer   This agent enriches each arc with detailed contextual information, including: main characters driving the arc, supporting or interfering characters influencing the arc in the episode, a concise description of the arc’s episodic events (the ”progression”).   6.1.7 Agent 7 - Progression Verifier   The progressions of each arc are reviewed to ensure specificity and relevance. This step ensures that sig- nificant developments are captured without overlap- ping with unrelated narratives.   6.1.8 Agent 8 - Character Role Verifier   Human input remains essential for refining the out- puts of the multi-agent system. The graphical inter- face is designed to facilitate this oversight and correc- tion, balancing simplicity with advanced features. It enables users to visualize, edit, regenerate, and ana- lyze narrative arcs effectively.   This agent verifies and, if necessary, corrects the clas- sification of characters as either main or interfering.   6.1.9 Agent 9 - Final Reviewer   The interface is divided into three main sections:   A final verification ensures narrative consistency. Val- idated arcs are stored in the database for future episodes’ analysis.   6.2 Semantic Comparison and Arc   After analyzing each episode, embeddings are gener- ated for the arcs. The embeddings represent the ”Ti- tle” and ”Description” of each arc, while the ”Con- tent” of the progression provides additional context.   These embeddings are compared against the vec- tor database to identify semantically similar arcs. If similarities are detected, an LLM determines whether the arcs represent the same storyline or not. Based on this determination, the system either stores them as new arcs or links them as continuations of overarch- ing plotlines.   • Narrative Arc Timeline: Provides a visual repre- sentation of how storylines evolve across episodes in a season. Users can apply filters based on arc type (Anthology, Genre-Specific, Soap) or associ- ated characters.   • Vector Store Explorer: Includes tools for visual- izing arc embeddings using 3D PCA and displays clusters of similar arcs.   • Character Section: Allows users to explore ex- tracted character entities, manage appellations, or merge similar characters.   7.2 Key Features and Functionalities   7.2.1 Arc and Progression Visualization   Users can navigate narrative arcs through a tabular in- terface, where rows represent arcs, and columns cor- respond to episodes. Each cell displays the arc’s pro- gression within a specific episode (see Figure 2).   7.2.2 Arc Creation and Editing   Arcs can be created or edited via a dialog box (see Figure 3). Users specify attributes such as title, de- scription, and arc type, as well as main characters and episodic progressions. Progressions can also be auto- generated using AI for efficiency.   7.2.3 Arc Merging and Deduplication   For overlapping or semantically similar arcs, users can compare them side-by-side and merge duplicates to maintain consistency.   Users can manually create or edit episodic progres- sions, which include episode-specific descriptions and interfering characters. Alternatively, progressions can be auto-generated and refined as needed.   7.2.5 Clustering and Semantic Analysis   Clustering tools group arcs based on semantic em- beddings and display them in both tabular and 3D PCA formats (see Figure 4). This feature helps users identify thematic connections and detect arcs that the multi-agent system incorrectly treated as distinct.   The character panel enables users to view, edit, and merge characters to ensure consistency across arcs. A similarity threshold based on the Jaccard index (Ni- wattanakul et al., 2013) highlights potential duplicate   characters for resolution. For example, Figure 5 illus- trates a false positive where two different characters with the same surname are identified as similar by the system.   The system’s performance was evaluated by com- paring its extracted narrative arcs, based solely on   episode summaries (paratexts), with arcs identified by a human scholar who analyzed the first season of Grey’s Anatomy after watching each episode at least twice.   Paratexts (Genette, 1997), such as episode plots, fan fiction, plot maps, and similar materials, have gained increasing significance in the Internet era (Laukkanen, 2024). While these materials do not, by their intrinsic nature, constitute the primary text it- self, they provide scholars like us with valuable sup- plementary resources for research and analysis.   The test was conducted across the entire season, and the results were analyzed to assess both the sys- tem’s capabilities and its limitations.   The system demonstrated notable strength in its abil- ity to perform LLM-aided character entity recognition and linking. It successfully identified 62 character entities within the test dataset, with 61 of these be- ing correct. The single duplicate entry (”Frost” and ”Jerry Frost”) resulted from inconsistent naming in the source material. Implementing a two-agent ver- ification system could resolve such errors but would increase computational costs.   In arc extraction, the system excelled in identify- ing Anthology Arcs, achieving a precision of 89.3% (25 out of 28 arcs correctly extracted).   However, challenges were observed with other arc types. The system occasionally duplicated arcs or failed to merge arcs representing the same storyline. For example, the arcs:   • ”Izzie Stevens: Overcoming Past and Professional   • ”Izzie Stevens: Balancing Personal Life and Pro-   fessional Ambitions”   were treated as separate, whereas human analysis   considered them part of a unified storyline.   Conversely, the system overlooked the shared arc of Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd’s relationship. Instead, it identified only individual character arcs for Meredith and Derek, effectively ”diluting” their shared storyline within the personal arcs of each char- acter.   Additionally, the system misclassified the ”Room- mates Dynamics” arc, which involves Meredith, Izzie, and George becoming roommates in the second episode. This storyline was grouped under a broader arc, ”Intern Dynamics: Friendship And Rivalry,” though human analysis deemed them distinct.   Progressions within arcs were generally consis- tent with their titles and descriptions. However, they   were not always fully captured for specific episodes, as episode summaries often omit minor developments that a viewer might identify.   Impact of the Graphic Interface   The graphical interface proved highly effective in re- It enabled human ana- fining the system’s outputs. lysts to review, correct, and enhance extracted arcs efficiently, with the assistance of LLM tools stream- lining the correction process.   This project tackled the challenge of analyzing the in- terwoven narrative arcs of serialized television. The multi-agent system introduced represents a step to- ward automating the traditionally manual process of identifying and organizing narrative arcs for deeper study.   While the results are promising, they also reveal limitations, particularly the reliance on textual para- texts, such as episode summaries, as the primary in- put. Summaries focus on major plot-driving events, neglecting subtle details found in visuals, dialogue, or other storytelling layers. Consequently, the system occasionally misses overlapping arcs or blends dis- tinct storylines.   However, this limitation also presents an oppor- tunity. The system is particularly well-suited for se- rialized written narratives, where all story elements are text-based. Serialized novels, episodic web fic- tion, and other text-driven storytelling formats elim- inate the multimodal challenges of TV series, offer- ing a clearer field for arc extraction and progression mapping. With minor adjustments, the workflow can be adapted to handle chapters, segments, or seman- tic chunks of text (Qu et al., 2024), treating them as ”episodes” to track storylines over an extended series. Future work will enhance the system by integrat- ing richer inputs such as subtitles, scene descriptions, and multimodal data. Refinements to the multi-agent system are also needed to improve reliability, particu- larly in managing overlapping arcs and deduplication. Expanding testing across diverse genres will further refine the system’s versatility and applicability.   Ultimately, the combination of automation and human oversight remains indispensable. While ma- chines excel at processing and organizing large datasets, human interpretation continues to provide the understanding required for meaningful narrative analysis.",

         "Importance\nActive surveillance in men with less aggressive prostate cancer is inconsistently used despite clinical guidelines. Renumeration generally favors treatment over conservative management and may contribute to the variable adoption of active surveillance, which suggests that value-based payment incentives may promote guideline-concordant care.\n\n\nObjective\nTo describe the adoption of active surveillance in low-risk prostate cancer, following the initiation of a novel payment incentive sponsored by a commercial payer to support its use.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cohort study included men with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2015 to 2021 with data registered with the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC), a statewide quality-improvement collaborative of practicing urologists. Eligible participants were men with newly diagnosed low-risk or low-volume, favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer who were eligible for active surveillance. Data were analyzed from January 2015 through December 2021.\n\n\nExposure\nHealth insurance payment incentive established between June 9, 2017, and September 30, 2018, to encourage active surveillance adoption within MUSIC. Upon meeting the target (ie, at least 72% of men with low-risk disease consider or initiate surveillance), the insurer would provide enhanced reimbursement on claims covered by preferred provider organization plans independent of diagnosis.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nActive surveillance adoption relative to the preincentive period among men with low-risk prostate cancer. Secondary analyses examined practices by baseline surveillance use and proportion of patients with eligible insurance plans, as well as patients with favorable intermediate-risk disease.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 15 273 patients (median [IQR] age, 65 [59-70] years), of whom 10 457 (68.5%) had low-risk disease. The percentage of these men electing for surveillance increased, from 54.4% in 2015 (729 of 1340 men) to 84.1% in 2021 (1089 of 1295 men). Relative to the preincentive period, the payment incentive was not associated with increased surveillance use among patients with low-risk disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75-1.24) during its application. Secondary analyses similarly did not demonstrate an association between the payment incentive and active surveillance adoption.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nA payment incentive was not associated with increased active surveillance adoption in men with low-risk prostate cancer relative to the preincentive period. Value-based reimbursement incentives may require tailored implementation that considers existing reimbursement policy and practice characteristics to improve prostate cancer care quality.",

Findings In this cohort study of more than 1.9 million pregnant people, access to MFM services varied across geography, even among pregnancies at risk for conditions that might require MFM involvement. Use of telemedicine-enabled MFM care increased in 2020 and 2021 but remained low; in 2021, 2.7% of urban and 1.7% of rural pregnancies received telemedicine-enabled MFM care.

         "BACKGROUND\nCystic fibrosis is a multisystem disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are commonly used in the treatment of acute deteriorations in symptoms (pulmonary exacerbations); however, recently the assumption that exacerbations are due to increases in bacterial burden has been questioned. This is an update of a previously published review.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo establish whether IV antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis improve short-term and long-term clinical outcomes.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and ongoing trials registers. Date of last search of Cochrane Trials Register: 19 June 2024.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials and the first treatment cycle of cross-over studies comparing IV antibiotics (given alone or in an antibiotic combination) with placebo, or inhaled or oral antibiotics for people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation. Studies comparing different IV antibiotic regimens were also eligible.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes lung function % predicted (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)), time to next exacerbation and quality of life.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 45 studies involving 2810 participants. The included studies were mostly small, and inadequately reported, many of which were quite old. The certainty of the evidence was mostly low. Combined intravenous antibiotics versus placebo Data reported for absolute change in % predicted FEV1 and FVC suggested a possible improvement in favour of IV antibiotics, but the evidence is very uncertain (1 study, 12 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not measure time to next exacerbation or quality of life. Intravenous versus nebulised antibiotics Five studies (122 participants) reported FEV1, with analysable data only from one study (16 participants). We found no difference between groups (moderate-certainty evidence). Three studies (91 participants) reported on FVC, with analysable data from only one study (54 participants). We are very uncertain on the effect of nebulised antibiotics (very low-certainty evidence). In one study, the 16 participants on nebulised plus IV antibiotics had a lower mean number of days to next exacerbation than those on combined IV antibiotics (low-certainty evidence), but we found no difference in quality of life between groups (low-certainty evidence). Intravenous versus oral antibiotics Three studies (172 participants) reported no difference in different measures of lung function. We found no difference in analysable data between IV and oral antibiotic regimens in either FEV1 % predicted or FVC % predicted (1 study, 24 participants; low-certainty evidence) or in the time to the next exacerbation (1 study, 108 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study measured quality of life. Intravenous antibiotic regimens compared One study (analysed as two data sets) compared the duration of IV antibiotic regimens between two groups (split according to initial antibiotic response). The first part was a non-inferiority study in 214 early treatment responders to establish whether 10 days of IV antibiotic treatment was as effective as 14 days. Second, investigators looked at whether 14 or 21 days of IV antibiotics were more effective in 705 participants who did not respond early to treatment. We found no difference in FEV1 % predicted with any duration of treatment (919 participants; high-certainty evidence) or the time to next exacerbation (information later taken from registry data). Investigators did not report FVC or quality of life. Other comparisons We also found little or no difference in lung function when comparing single IV antibiotic regimens to placebo (2 studies, 70 participants), or in lung function and time to next exacerbation when comparing different single antibiotic regimens (2 studies, 95 participants). There may be a greater improvement in lung function in participants receiving combined IV antibiotics compared to single IV antibiotics (6 studies, 265 participants; low- to very low-certainty evidence), but probably no difference in the time to next exacerbation (1 study, 34 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four studies compared a single IV antibiotic plus placebo to a combined IV antibiotic regimen with high levels of heterogeneity in the results. We are very uncertain if there is any difference between groups in lung function (4 studies, 214 participants) and there may be little or no difference to being re-admitted to hospital for an exacerbation (2 studies, 104 participants). Nine studies (417 participants) compared combined IV antibiotic regimens with a great variation in drugs. We identified no differences in any measure of lung function or the time to next exacerbation between different regimens (low- to very low-certainty evidence). There were mixed results for adverse events across all comparisons; common adverse effects included elevated liver function tests, gastrointestinal events and haematological abnormalities. There were limited data for other secondary outcomes, such as weight, and there was no evidence of treatment effect.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence of benefit from administering IV antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis is often poor, especially in terms of size of studies and risk of bias, particularly in older studies. We are not certain whether there is any difference between specific antibiotic combinations, and neither is there evidence of a difference between the IV route and the inhaled or oral routes. There is limited evidence that shorter antibiotic duration in adults who respond early to treatment is not different to a longer period of treatment. There remain several unanswered questions regarding optimal IV antibiotic treatment regimens.",

It is characterised by\nviscid secretions of many organs, in particular the lungs and pan-\ncreas. In the lungs these viscid secretions interfere with the mech-\nanisms responsible for clearing inhaled material, allowing oppor-\ntunistic bacteria to establish infections. Important pathogens in-\nclude Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus au-\nreus (S.aureus), Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, and many others, with S.\naureus and P. aeruginosa being the most prevalent in childhood\nand adulthood respectively (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient\nRegistry 2011; Guss 2011). It is thought that early infection\nwith P. aeruginosa may be eradicated by antibiotics (Gibson 2003;\nLangton Hewer 2009; Ratjen 2001), but eventually the infection\nbecomes chronic and can no longer be eradicated. Chronic infec-\ntion causes persistent symptoms of cough and sputum production\nand is associated with progressive loss of lung function (Ballmann\n1998). In addition, people with CF experience pulmonary exacer-\nbations, which are characterised by an increase in symptoms (Goss\n2007) and reductions in lung function, weight and quality of life\n(Britto 2002). The causes of these exacerbations are not known,\nbut it is suspected that they may be due, in part, to bacterial in-\nfection. A standard deﬁnition of what constitutes a pulmonary ex-\nacerbation has yet to be agreed, but there is reasonable consensus\nthat a pulmonary exacerbation usually consists of people with CF\nreporting a decline in well-being largely due to respiratory symp-\ntoms that prompts the commencement of a course of antibiotics\n(Bilton 2011).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nDescription of the intervention\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nPulmonary exacerbations have long been treated with antibiotics\nand this is currently the recommendation in Europe (Doring 2000)\nand the USA (Flume 2009). An assumption underlying a corner-\nstone of CF care is that pulmonary exacerbations are associated\nwith bacterial infection (in particular due to P. aeruginosa), leading\nto the conclusion that these exacerbations should be treated with\nantibiotics (Doring 2000). Observational data suggest that oral, in-\ntravenous (IV) and nebulised antibiotics are administered to treat\na pulmonary exacerbation (Wagener 2013). When IV antibiotics\nare used, a combination of two or more different IV antibiotics\nare recommended; however, the optimal duration of IV antibiotic\ntherapy is unknown (Flume 2009; Elphick 2014; Plummer 2013).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nHow the intervention might work\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAlthough an accepted deﬁnition of what constitutes a pulmonary\nexacerbation has yet to be developed, pulmonary exacerbations\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nare assumed to be caused (at least in part) by bacterial infection.\nAntibiotics are administered in order to reduce the amount of bac-\nteria in the lungs that are presumed to be responsible for much\nof the decline in the individual’s clinical condition (Flume 2009).\nThese antibiotics may, or may not, reduce the amount of bacte-\nria in the lungs. There may be many different species of bacteria\npresent (Guss 2011) and these broad-spectrum antibiotics may\nhave variable activity against these bacteria. However, antibiotics\nmay themselves be associated with considerable morbidity includ-\ning selecting for antibiotic resistance (Rogues 2007) and causing\nrenal toxicity and ototoxicity (Bertenshaw 2007; Smyth 2014).\nProlonged courses of antibiotic treatment may also pose a signiﬁ-\ncant burden of treatment for people with CF to endure.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nWhy it is important to do this review\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nPulmonary exacerbations are responsible for an accelerated decline\nin lung function (de Boer 2011) and a signiﬁcant proportion of\npeople experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation who are treated\nwith IV antibiotics, do not recover lung function to baseline (\nSanders 2010). Potential reasons for this include:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• the aetiology of the exacerbation (e.g. viral infection) and so\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nprevention is the main goal;\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• the host (e.g. inﬂammation) so novel therapies might be\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\ndeveloped to modulate the immune system;\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• factors related to the treatment, and so we must determine\noptimal treatments (and routes of treatment) which can include\nuse of IV antibiotics.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOften, IV antibiotics are held to be the most effective form of\nantibiotic delivery.

This tool facilitates the\nassessment of biases introduced through inadequacies in random\nsequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of partici-\npants and study personnel, blinding of outcome assessments, re-\nporting of incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. As\nwith data extraction, the two investigators extracted this informa-\ntion with the same process for comparison and resolution of dis-\nparity. They were not blinded to the authors of each study. In some\ninstances more information is required and in future the review\nauthors will attempt to contact the study authors or sponsors for\nmore detail to be included in updates of this review. All investiga-\ntors agreed the ﬁnal judgement regarding whether any individual\nbias or group of biases imposes a material bias impacting upon\nthe results and conclusions of a study, informed by the empirical\nevidence, likely direction and magnitude of any bias.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nMeasures of treatment effect\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe authors assessed continuous outcomes (lung function, nutri-\ntional status, quality of life and symptom scores) by the calcula-\ntion of mean difference (MD) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs).\nWhere trials reported multiple measures for the same outcome\n(e.g. absolute change FEV1 per cent (%) predicted, or absolute\nchange of absolute FEV1 volumes) the review authors calculated\nstandardised mean differences (SMDs). In the event that individ-\nual participant data had been available, the authors would have\nconsidered absolute changes in FEV1 in context of comparable\ndata being available for each participant before and after the in-\ntervention so that a calculation of the effect size was possible.\nIf the data allowed, the authors would have extracted or calculated\nhazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for the outcome ’Time to next\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nUnit of analysis issues\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe authors aimed to only consider the ﬁrst pulmonary exacerba-\ntion for each participant, taking the measure of effect as the dif-\nference between baseline and the end of treatment. The optimal\nduration of therapy is yet to be established and so the authors con-\nsidered the end of therapy measurement (as deﬁned in the study)\nas the unit of analysis. In the case of cross-over studies they aimed\nto consider only the ﬁrst phase of participation, as participants\nmay not recover lung function to baseline (Sanders 2010) and,\nin addition to introducing a unit of analysis error, multiple treat-\nment episodes may not be comparable. In effect, these studies re-\nmain listed in Studies awaiting classiﬁcation as the authors await\ndata to include in the analysis. In order to compare interventions\nof differing durations the authors aimed, given sufﬁcient compa-\nrable studies reporting these data, to combine outcome data for\ncomparisons at two weeks, three months and one year after the\nexacerbation. If future studies consistently report this, they shall\nundertake this analysis in future updates.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nDealing with missing data\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWhen possible the review authors aimed to contact the study au-\nthors for data that appeared to be missing. Where only mean val-\nues and standard deviations (SDs) before and after treatment were\navailable, they imputed the SD of the mean change using a cor-\nrelation coefﬁcient as described in theCochrane Handbook for Sys-\ntematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a). For the calcu-\nlation of a correlation coefﬁcient for studies that reported FEV1\nand FVC in terms of % predicted, the authors used data from the\n1988 Bosso study, as this study reported the mean and SD for pre-\ntreatment and post-treatment and also the SD of the mean change\n(Bosso 1988). Similarly, for studies that reported FEV1 and FVC\nin absolute change (litres) the authors used data from the 1987\nHodson study (Hodson 1987). When appropriate to do so, the\nauthors may remedy missing data by the imputation of replace-\nment values (e.g. using the mean value for a treatment group).\nWhere possible they will conduct intention-to-treat analyses.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nAssessment of heterogeneity\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWhere the review authors were able to perform a meta-analysis\nwith multiple studies suitable for inclusion, they attempted to\nidentify statistical heterogeneity by calculating a Chi2 test and us-\ning this value to compute an I2 statistic (Higgins 2003).

They also aimed to contact the authors of any study\npublished only in abstract form for study data. Where available,\nthey attempted to identify evidence of outcome reporting biases\nby the comparison of the published report to the study protocol.\nThey further attempted to identify reporting biases by the con-\nstruction and inspection of funnel plots for asymmetry and in-\nterpreting them in the context of study sizes, and methodological\nrigour (Sterne 2011).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nData synthesis\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe authors conducted separate meta-analyses for the grouped\ncomparisons as detailed above (Types of interventions). They con-\nducted a ﬁxed-effect method meta-analysis to combine the mea-\nsures of effect for the outcomes of study. In the case of at least\nsubstantial heterogeneity (as deﬁned above), they would have em-\nployed a random-effects method.\nThe authors used the inverse variance method of meta-analysis for\ncontinuous data and the Mantel-Haenzsel method for dichoto-\nmous data as the default ﬁxed-effect methods in RevMan. The\nauthors would have used the generic inverse variance method for\nthe outcome ’time to next pulmonary exacerbation’ if data had\nbeen available for analysis.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nSubgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn the case that the authors had identiﬁed a sufﬁcient number of\nstudies (i.e. 10), they would have undertaken subgroup analyses\nfor the following groups:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• bacteria isolated at time of exacerbation P. aeruginosa versus\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nnon P. aeruginosa;\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• severity of lung disease based on a composite of age and\nFEV1 to delineate ’severe’ and ’mild’ as classiﬁed by Schluchter\n(Schluchter 2006); and\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• age of participants (children (less than 18 years of age) and\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nadults).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nSensitivity analysis\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAgain, if the authors had identiﬁed a sufﬁcient number of stud-\nies for inclusion, they would have investigated the effect of arbi-\ntrary decisions made by the review team by undertaking sensitivity\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nanalyses of the affected components.

All studies were of a parallel design; cross-over\nstudies are awaiting pending data for inclusion (see Characteristics\nof studies awaiting classiﬁcation).\nMost of the studies were single-centre studies; however, one study\nhad two centres (McLaughlin 1983) and a further ﬁve studies were\nmulti-centre (three or more centres) (Blumer 2005; BTS 1985;\nChurch 1997; Richard 1997; Smith 1999).

Where data were\navailable regarding gender split, groups were largely equally split,\nexcept for ﬁve studies where males were predominant (Gold 1985;\nPenketh 1984; Regelmann 1990; Salh 1992; Stephens 1983) and\nthree studies where females were predominant (Gold 1987; Huang\n1983; Padoan 1987).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFew studies described the disease severity of the participants; those\nthat did largely did so on the basis of FEV1 (Blumer 2005; Church\n1997; Conway 1997), while two explicitly enrolled those with “se-\nvere” disease (Padoan 1987; Wesley 1988). Other studies actively\nexcluded those with severe disease; two studies excluded those with\nprotocol-deﬁned severe disease (Gold 1985; Schaad 1986), while\na further two studies did so on the basis of lung function - one\nexcluded those with FEV1 less than 40% predicted (Master 2001)\nand the second excluded those with FEV1 less than 20% predicted\n(Penketh 1984). One study excluded those who had been admit-\nted to hospital more recently than four months prior to the current\nadmission (Schaad 1989).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nInterventions\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nIV antibiotic versus placebo\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe identiﬁed seven studies that investigated the activity of an IV\nantibiotic regimen with a placebo in the comparison (Gold 1987;\nHyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; McLaughlin 1983; Regelmann\n1990; Smith 1999; Wientzen 1980). While three of these were\ndirect comparisons of an intervention versus placebo (Gold 1987;\nRegelmann 1990; Wientzen 1980), four trials involved a placebo\ndrug as part of an IV antibiotic combination, thereby attempting\nto consider the effect of single active agent versus combination\nagent treatment and are further discussed in the section below\n(Single IV antibiotic versus combination IV antibiotic) (Hyatt 1981;\nMacfarlane 1985; McLaughlin 1983; Smith 1999).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nSingle IV antibiotic versus placebo\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTwo studies involved a direct comparison between a single antibi-\notic (ceftazidime and tobramycin respectively) and placebo (Gold\n1987; Wientzen 1980).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nCombination of IV antibiotics versus placebo\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOne further study compared an antibiotic combination (to-\nbramycin and ticarcillin) and placebo (Regelmann 1990) .\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nIV antibiotic regimens compared\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nA total of 29 studies compared multiple IV antibiotic regimens.\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nIntravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic ﬁbrosis (Review)\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

One study compared ﬁve different\nantibiotics - azlocillin versus piperacillin versus ceftazidime versus\ncefsulodin versus cefoperazone (Agostini 1983); a further study\ncompared cefsulodin to tobramycin or ticarcillin (Caplan 1984).\nThe remaining three studies compared two single IV antibiotics:\nceftazidime versus aztreonam (Elborn 1992); carbenicillin versus\nazlocillin (Huang 1983); and ceftazidime versus aztreonam (Salh\n1992). Two arms of the Costantini trial compared carbenicillin\nalone to sisomycin alone (Costantini 1982).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nSingle IV antibiotic versus combination IV antibiotic\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFour studies involved a placebo drug as part of an IV antibiotic\ncombination, thereby attempting to consider the effect of sin-\ngle active agent versus combination agent treatment (Hyatt 1981;\nMacfarlane 1985; McLaughlin 1983; Smith 1999). Hyatt studied\noxacillin in combination with placebo compared to a combina-\ntion of oxacillin, sisomycin and carbenicillin (Hyatt 1981). Mac-\nFarlane considered two doses of piperacillin (50 mg/kg six times\ndaily and 100 mg/kg three times daily) each in combination with\ntobramycin compared to tobramycin with placebo (Macfarlane\n1985). McLaughlin compared the combination of ticarcillin and\ntobramycin to a combination of azlocillin and tobramycin and\nfurther compared these with azlocillin and placebo (McLaughlin\n1983). In the ﬁnal study, Smith considered the combination of\nazlocillin and tobramycin compared with azlocillin and placebo\n(Smith 1999).\nA total of 12 separate studies compared a single IV antibiotic with\na combination of two IV antibiotics; of these ﬁve investigated the\nuse of combination antibiotic treatment by comparing the effect\nof a single antibiotic with the same antibiotic in combination\nwith another agent (Conway 1997; Costantini 1982; Master 2001;\nMcCarty 1988; Padoan 1987) and seven compared a single agent\nto two different antibiotics in combination (Bosso 1988; BTS\n1985; De Boeck 1989; De Boeck 1999; Gold 1985; Padoan 1987;\nWesley 1988). One study consisted of multiple comparison arms\nwhich fall into both these comparisons (Padoan 1987). Another,\ncompared a combination of IV antibiotics with a different IV\nantibiotic followed by the same antibiotic in oral form (Church\n1997).\nThe antibiotics and their combinations used were varied, none of\nthe studies comparing a single IV antibiotic to combination IV an-\ntibiotics used the same single agent. One study compared colistin\nalone to a combination of colistin with either aztreonam, azlocillin,\npiperacillin, ceftazidime, imipinem, or ciproﬂoxacin (Conway\n1997). A second study compared tobramycin to tobramycin with\nceftazidime (Master 2001). A further study compared piperacillin\nto piperacillin with tobramycin (McCarty 1988). In addition to\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthe two single-agent comparison arms of the Costantini trial men-\ntioned above (carbenicillin alone to sisomycin alone), the trial also\ncompared each single agent alone to carbenicillin combined with\nsisomycin (Costantini 1982). A further trial with multiple com-\nparison arms compared ceftazidime alone to ceftazidime with si-\nsomycin (Padoan 1987). The seven studies comparing a single\nagent with a combination of two different antibiotics also used a\nrange of different agents. Ceftazidime was used as the single agent\nin ﬁve studies, it was compared to: gentamicin plus carbenicillin\n(BTS 1985); tobramycin plus piperacillin (De Boeck 1989); to-\nbramycin plus ticarcillin (Gold 1985; Wesley 1988) and, in ad-\ndition to the comparison discussed above, to piperacillin plus si-\nsomycin (Padoan 1987). Ceftazidime was also used in combina-\ntion with tobramycin and compared to meropenem alone in one\nstudy (De Boeck 1999). The ﬁnal study compared aztreonam to\ntobramycin plus azlocillin (Bosso 1988).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nCombination IV antibiotic regimens compared\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nNine studies compared two combinations of two different IV\nantibiotics (Blumer 2005; Conway 1985; McLaughlin 1983;\nPenketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Schaad 1986; Schaad 1989;\nSemykin 2010; Wang 1988). Again the IV antibiotics used were\nvaried. Two studies administered a combination of netilmicin\nand ticarcillin, but compared these to tobramycin and ticarcillin\n(Conway 1985) and netilmicin and azlocillin (Schaad 1986). Two\nstudies by the same lead author compared carbenicillin and gen-\ntamicin to other IV antibiotic combinations, ﬁrstly, carbenicillin\nplus gentamicin versus ticarcillin plus gentamicin (Penketh 1983)\nand secondly carbenicillin plus gentamicin versus azlocillin plus\ngentamicin (Penketh 1984). The remaining two studies compared\nmeropenem plus tobramycin versus ceftazidime plus tobramycin\n(Blumer 2005) and aztreonam plus amikacin versus ceftazidime\nplus amikacin (Schaad 1989). Semykin compared IV cefepime\nplus IV amikacin to IV meropenem plus IV amikacin, in addition\nto a nebulised antibiotic arm (discussed below) (Semykin 2010).\nMcLaughlin considered the combination of ticarcillin plus to-\nbramycin compared with azlocillin plus tobramycin (as well as an-\nother arm with a placebo as discussed above) (McLaughlin 1983).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nIV antibiotic regimen versus nebulised antibiotics\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nA total of ﬁve studies compared IV antibiotics to nebulised antibi-\notics.\nOne study compared an IV antibiotic regimen with an inhaled an-\ntibiotic regimen using IV tobramycin and ticarcillin compared to\ninhaled tobramycin and inhaled carbenicillin (Cooper 1985). Four\nstudies investigated the effect of inhaled antibiotics as an adjunct to\nintravenous antibiotic use (Knowles 1988; Schaad 1987; Semykin\n2010; Stephens 1983). Knowles compared IV piperacillin and IV\ntobramycin to IV piperacillin and IV tobramycin with the addition\nof these same antibiotics delivered by nebuliser (Knowles 1988).\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nIntravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic ﬁbrosis (Review)\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The fourth study to\ncompare IV antibiotics to nebulised antibiotics compared IV ce-\nfepime with IV amikacin to IV meropenem and IV amikacin and\nalso to inhaled tobramycin given alongside IV ceftazidime and oral\nciproﬂoxacin (Semykin 2010).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nIV antibiotic regimen versus oral antibiotics\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nSix studies compared IV antibiotics to oral antibiotics.\nFour studies compared oral ciproﬂoxacin with two-agent IV com-\nbinations (Bosso 1989; Hodson 1987; Richard 1997; Wang 1988).\nOne study compared oral ciproﬂoxacin to IV azlocillin with gen-\ntamicin (Hodson 1987) and another study compared it to IV cef-\ntazidime with tobramycin (Richard 1997). A further study com-\npared oral ciproﬂoxacin to IV tobramycin with azlocillin (Bosso\n1989) and the remaining study had a three-arm comparison of\noral ciproﬂoxacin to IV tobramycin with azlocillin and to IV to-\nbramycin and ticarcillin (Wang 1988).\nA ﬁfth study compared oral ciproﬂoxacin with oral ciproﬂoxacin\ncycled with IV tobramycin with azlocillin (Black 1990). One study\ncompared IV ciproﬂoxacin followed by oral ciproﬂoxacin to IV\ntobramycin with IV ceftazidime (Church 1997).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nMultiple comparisons\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAmong the studies described above, six included multiple com-\nparisons within a single study (Church 1997; Costantini 1982;\nMcLaughlin 1983; Padoan 1987; Semykin 2010; Wang 1988).\nChurch compared single agent IV ciproﬂoxacin followed by sin-\ngle agent oral ciproﬂoxacin with combination treatment with IV\ntobramycin and IV ceftazidime with multiple reporting periods\nthus comparing both single with combination IV agents and oral\ncompared with IV (Church 1997). Costantini compared IV car-\nbenicillin to IV sisomycin each as single agents and to IV carbeni-\ncillin with sisomycin combined (Costantini 1982). McLaughlin\ncompared IV ticarcillin with IV azlocillin each in combination\nwith IV tobramycin and also with a third comparison group of IV\nazlocillin in combination with placebo (McLaughlin 1983).\nPadoan compared IV ceftazidime to IV ceftazidime with sisomycin\nand to IV piperacillin with sisomycin (Padoan 1987). Semykin\ncompared IV cefepime with IV amikacin to IV meropenem and\nIV amikacin and to inhaled tobramycin given alongside IV cef-\ntazidime and oral ciproﬂoxacin (Semykin 2010). Wang studied\noral ciproﬂoxacin compared to IV tobramycin with ticarcillin and\nto IV tobramycin with azlocillin (Wang 1988).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nOutcomes\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSome of the earlier studies reported clinical status in the form of a\n’clinical score’. These were not standardised or validated and the\ncomponents of the scores varied between studies. Many studies\ndid not report absolute values of measures, instead detailing the\nresults of a statistical comparison between groups.\nLung function was the most commonly reported outcome (32\nstudies); however, this was variably reported as either percentage\nchange or absolute change in either % predicted or absolute val-\nues of FEV1 or FVC. This made comparing the results of similar\nstudies difﬁcult. In addition, few studies reported means and mea-\nsures of distribution of all lung function measurements - initial,\nend measurements and a measure of the change over time. Where\nnecessary we imputed the SDs for change using a correlation co-\nefﬁcient that was calculated from those studies that did report the\nrequisite information, namely for data reported as FEV1 % pre-\ndicted, a correlation coefﬁcient was calculated using data from the\nBosso study (Bosso 1989) and for data reported as absolute values,\na correlation coefﬁcient was calculated using data in the Hodson\nstudy (Hodson 1987).\nStudies infrequently reported nutritional status and again variously\n- either in absolute terms or as a measure of % underweight. Time-\nto-next exacerbation was reported in only eight studies; and then\nwith data suitable for use in a meta-analysis only available from two\nstudies (De Boeck 1989; McLaughlin 1983). Two studies report\nrates of re-admission in the three months following the study (BTS\n1985; Wesley 1988). Three studies report a statistical test without\nsupporting data (Penketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Smith 1999).\nAdverse effects were variably reported in 26 studies, consisting of\neither speciﬁc reports of toxicities (ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity)\n(Penketh 1983; Regelmann 1990; Schaad 1987; Schaad 1989),\nscreens for general toxicities using serum markers of liver and renal\nfunction or reports of side effects (Agostini 1983; Black 1990;\nBosso 1988; BTS 1985; Caplan 1984; Conway 1997; Costantini\n1982; Huang 1983; Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; Master 2001;\nPadoan 1987; Penketh 1983; Schaad 1986; Schaad 1987; Wang\n1988; Wesley 1988), or discussion of bacterial resistance patterns\n(Church 1997; Gold 1985; Hodson 1987; McLaughlin 1983;\nPenketh 1984; Salh 1992; Stephens 1983). Mortality was reported\nin seven studies (Caplan 1984; Conway 1985; De Boeck 1989;\nHyatt 1981; McLaughlin 1983; Penketh 1984; Wientzen 1980).\nQuality of life and adherence were not reported in any study.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nExcluded studies\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nA total of 82 studies were excluded (Characteristics of excluded\nstudies).

Five\nstudies did not include an IV antibiotic comparator (Day 1988;\nGold 1983; Heaf 1984; Levy 1982; Nikonova 2010). Two were\nexcluded as the comparison was one of process; bronchoscopy-\nguided management (Wainwright 2011) or pharmacist versus\nself-care (Ramstrom 2000). Three studies were observational or\nnon-intervention studies (Dodge 1983; Hatziagorou 2013; Moss\n1991) and two studies were in vitro studies (Aaron 2005; Balsamo\n1986).

For four of the studies it\nwas unclear if the study was randomised (Crawley 2005; Huang\n1979; Kapranov 1995; Vic 1997). We are awaiting data that report\nincludable participant episodes in the case of the four cross-over\nstudies (Al-Aloul 2005; Dinwiddie 1982; Döring 1995; Geborek\n2003), one of which included a placebo arm (Döring 1995), and\nalso the two studies that report multiple indications (e.g. exac-\nerbations and suppressive regimens) (Latzin 2008; Parry 1978).\nThe Beaudry study met our eligibility criteria, but did not report\nany outcomes listed in this review (Beaudry 1980). Finally, one\nabstract was cited in the reference list of a further article, we have\nnot been able to access this abstract yet and as such details about\nparticipants, methods and interventions are still unclear (Harris\n1984).

In two studies, while it was stated that\nrandomisation was carried out by pharmacists, the details of the\nmethod were not described and so the authors considered the risk\nof bias to be unclear (McLaughlin 1983; Salh 1992). A further\nstudy stratiﬁed randomisation by disease severity and age; how-\never, again the method of randomisation used was not stated and\nso this study was also considered to be at an unclear risk of bias\n(Master 2001). Six studies were judged to be at a low risk of bias for\nsequence generation; four studies used a table of random numbers\n(Gold 1985; Hyatt 1981; Regelmann 1990; Wientzen 1980) and\na further two were randomised by a randomisation code (Huang\n1983; Smith 1999).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nAllocation concealment\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFour studies described either sequentially numbered envelopes or\nopaque envelopes as a mechanism for concealing allocation af-\nter randomisation (BTS 1985; McCarty 1988; McLaughlin 1983;\nSalh 1992). While no study used both sequential numbering or\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nmade clear that the envelopes were opaque, the authors regarded\nthese studies to be at a low risk of bias with regard to allocation con-\ncealment. One study stated that both the antibiotics and placebo\nwere prepared in the pharmacy and delivered in coded bottles; the\ncode was not broken in case of ’treatment failure’ (Hyatt 1981).\nThis study was also considered to have a low risk of bias from\nallocation concealment. All other studies were considered to be at\nan unclear risk of bias due to insufﬁcient information.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nBlinding\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFourteen studies were described as double blind. Six of these stud-\nies involved the preparation of identical syringes or infusions pre-\npared in pharmacy with adequate blinding of outcome assessment\nand so we felt them to be at a low risk of bias (Hyatt 1981;\nMacfarlane 1985; Master 2001; Salh 1992; Smith 1999; Wientzen\n1980).\nWe judged the remaining eight studies which were described as\ndouble-blind to have an unclear risk of bias. The Gold study at-\ntempted to blind both participants and outcome assessors; how-\never, participant blinding was potentially compromised by partic-\nipants being able to detect a characteristic odour from urine when\nthey were treated with ceftazidime (Gold 1987). The effect of this\nhas been classiﬁed as ’unclear’ as it is unknown what proportion of\nparticipants had previously received ceftazidime and noticed the\ncharacteristic change (or otherwise); although it is noted that three\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nIntravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic ﬁbrosis (Review)\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The Regelmann\nstudy involved the generation of sham drug levels, although no\nfurther detail was given and so we considered the study to also be\nat an unclear risk of bias (Regelmann 1990). The remaining six\ntrials did not describe the method of participant blinding and so\nthe risk of bias is also considered to be unclear (Agostini 1983;\nChurch 1997; Huang 1983; McLaughlin 1983; Padoan 1987;\nWesley 1988).\nEight studies were considered to be at a high risk of both per-\nformance and detection bias due to an open study design (Bosso\n1988; Bosso 1989; BTS 1985; Conway 1985; McCarty 1988;\nPenketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Richard 1997).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nPerformance bias\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nSeven studies were considered to be at a low risk of performance\nbias due to adequate evidence of blinding of participants (Hyatt\n1981; Macfarlane 1985; Master 2001; McLaughlin 1983; Salh\n1992; Smith 1999; Wientzen 1980); 13 studies were considered to\nbe at a high risk of performance bias due to no blinding of partici-\npants (Bosso 1988; Bosso 1989; BTS 1985; Caplan 1984; Conway\n1985; Conway 1997; De Boeck 1989; Gold 1985; Knowles 1988;\nMcCarty 1988; Penketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Richard 1997).\nWith the remaining 20 studies we were unable to make an assess-\nment due to insufﬁcient information.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nDetection bias\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThirteen studies were considered to be at a low risk of detection\nbias due to adequate evidence of outcome assessor blinding (De\nBoeck 1989; Gold 1985; Gold 1987; Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane\n1985; Master 2001; McLaughlin 1983; Salh 1992; Schaad 1987;\nSchaad 1989; Smith 1999; Stephens 1983; Wientzen 1980). Eight\nstudies were considered to be at a high risk of detection bias due\nto an open study design (Bosso 1988; Bosso 1989; BTS 1985;\nConway 1985; McCarty 1988; Penketh 1983; Penketh 1984;\nRichard 1997). With the remaining 19 studies we were unable to\nmake an assessment due to insufﬁcient information.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nIncomplete outcome data\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTwelve studies were considered to be at a low risk of attrition bias;\neight studies documented that there were no participants who\nwithdrew during the study period and as such are considered to be\nat a low risk of bias (Bosso 1988; Caplan 1984; De Boeck 1989;\nGold 1985; Hodson 1987; McCarty 1988; Penketh 1984; Schaad\n1987). A further four studies reported an intention-to-treat anal-\nysis, or reported the last contributed data for those who withdrew\nand so are also considered to be at a low risk of bias (Conway\n1997; Hyatt 1981; Master 2001; Richard 1997). Fourteen stud-\nies did not include participants who withdrew in the analysis (or\nwhere incomplete data are presented) and are considered to be\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nat a high risk of bias (Agostini 1983; Blumer 2005; Bosso 1989;\nBTS 1985; Church 1997; Gold 1987; Huang 1983; Macfarlane\n1985; McLaughlin 1983; Regelmann 1990; Schaad 1986; Schaad\n1989; Smith 1999; Wientzen 1980). In some analyses this effect\nreaches a considerable proportion of the overall study group, as\nexempliﬁed by the four studies contributing to the analysis of sin-\ngle IV antibiotics in combination with placebo versus combina-\ntion IV antibiotics where 23% of participants do not contribute\nto the ﬁnal analysis. Also in the comparison of a single agent (no\nplacebo) versus an antibiotic combination, there were 10 studies\n(345 participants) reporting on FEV1; however only four studies\nwith 152 participants contribute to the analysis.\nAdditionally, in the Wientzen study two participants died in the\nplacebo group (one on Day 1 and the second on Day 4). Due\nto the small study size this is surprising and so suggests either a\nfailure of random allocation or a difference in the characteristics\nof the comparator groups at baseline (Wientzen 1980). In the\nRegelmann study, one participant was withdrawn by the attending\nphysician for “failing to improve rapidly enough”. Furthermore of\nthe 15 participants, only four in the placebo group and eight in\nthe antibiotic group contribute data to the ﬁnal analysis at two\nweeks (Regelmann 1990). Both studies are therefore considered\nto be at high risk of bias in the domain of incomplete outcome\ndata.\nThe remaining 15 studies did not report details concerning with-\ndrawals or adequacy of reporting to allow an assessment to be\nmade.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nSelective reporting\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe inadequate reporting of studies made it difﬁcult to reach a\ndecision regarding selective reporting in the majority of instances.\nThis was largely due to many of the included studies being un-\ndertaken prior to the establishment of trial registries and routine\narchiving of study protocols. In two studies it was clear that lung\nfunction data had been recorded but not reported (Black 1990;\nCaplan 1984) and another stated that time-to-next exacerbation\ndata were recorded, but not reported (Knowles 1988). We consid-\nered these studies to have a high risk of bias. We were unable to\nretrieve the protocols for any study and so were unable to deter-\nmine a study to be at a low risk of bias.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nOther potential sources of bias\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAn additional issue with the outcomes addressed in this review\nis the heterogeneity with which they are reported, not only in\nterms of the wide variety of units for change in lung function\n(absolute change, percentage change in absolute values (litres),\nper cent change in % predicted values) but also the variety of\nmeasures reported (BMI, weight, proportion underweight) that\nmake contributing studies to a meta-analysis challenging.\nA unit of analysis issue was introduced in 20 studies which\ninvolved people who participated on more than one occasion\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nIntravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic ﬁbrosis (Review)\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Cystic ﬁbrosis is a multi-system disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. Intravenous antibiotics are commonly used in the treatment of acute deteriorations in symptoms (pulmonary exacerbations); however, recently the assumption that exacerbations are due to increases in bacterial burden has been questioned.   To establish if intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic ﬁbrosis improve short- and long-term clinical outcomes.   Search methods   We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and ongoing trials registers.   Date of last search of Cochrane trials register: 27 July 2015.   Selection criteria   Randomised controlled trials and the ﬁrst treatment cycle of cross-over studies comparing intravenous antibiotics (given alone or in an antibiotic combination) with placebo, inhaled or oral antibiotics for people with cystic ﬁbrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation.   Data collection and analysis   The authors assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data.   Main results   We included 40 studies involving 1717 participants. The quality of the included studies was largely poor and, with a few exceptions, these comprised of mainly small, inadequately reported studies.   When comparing treatment with a single antibiotic to a combined antibiotic regimen, those participants receiving a combination of antibiotics experienced a greater improvement in lung function when considered as a whole group across a number of different measurements of lung function, but with very low quality evidence. When limited to the four placebo-controlled studies (n = 214), no difference was observed, again with very low quality evidence. With regard to the review’s remaining primary outcomes, there was no effect upon time to next exacerbation and no studies in any comparison reported on quality of life. There were no effects on the secondary outcomes weight or adverse effects. When comparing speciﬁc antibiotic combinations there were no signiﬁcant differences between groups on any measure. In the comparisons between intravenous and nebulised antibiotic or oral antibiotic (low quality evidence), there were no signiﬁcant differences between groups on any measure. No studies in any comparison reported on quality of life.   Authors’ conclusions   The quality of evidence comparing intravenous antibiotics with placebo is poor. No speciﬁc antibiotic combination can be considered to be superior to any other, and neither is there evidence showing that the intravenous route is superior to the inhaled or oral routes. There remains a need to understand host-bacteria interactions and in particular to understand why many people fail to fully respond to treatment.   The use of intravenous antibiotics to treat pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic ﬁbrosis   Review question   Do intravenous antibiotics (antibiotics given via a vein) given to treat ’ﬂare ups’ of lung disease (pulmonary exacerbations) in people with cystic ﬁbrosis improve clinical outcomes in the short term and the long term?   We wanted to evaluate the evidence for the current practice of using intravenous antibiotics to treat people with cystic ﬁbrosis who have a pulmonary exacerbation. We wanted to discover if it is better to give two antibiotics than just a single antibiotic and wanted to consider if any particular antibiotic combination is better than any other. We also wanted to discover if intravenous antibiotics are any better than inhaled or oral antibiotics in treating pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic ﬁbrosis.   Search date   We last searched for evidence on 27 July 2015.   Study characteristics   The review included 40 studies with 1717 people with cystic ﬁbrosis. Studies compared intravenous antibiotics with placebo (dummy drug with no active medication) and also one antibiotic compared to two antibiotics given together. Speciﬁc antibiotic combinations were also compared as were intravenous antibiotics with antibiotics that were breathed in (inhaled) and antibiotics that were swallowed (oral). The studies lasted from three to 15 days, although most of the studies lasted for two weeks.   In the comparison between those people who were given just one antibiotic and those who were given two, it appeared that those receiving two antibiotics experienced a greater improvement in lung function, but when limited to only those studies that included a dummy drug, we did not see any difference. There was no effect upon the amount of time until the next exacerbation, weight, or adverse effects. No combination of antibiotics was any better than any other. The outcomes for people were the same irrespective of whether they were treated by intravenous, oral or inhaled antibiotics. None of the studies reported on quality of life.   The quality of the included studies was often poor and many were not properly reported. Some studies included volunteers more than once which made comparing treatments difﬁcult. It was also often difﬁcult to decide from the information given how well the studies were carried out - particularly with respect to how volunteers were chosen and whether the volunteers or doctors could tell which treatment they were being given.

Description of the condition   Cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) is a multi-organ life-limiting condition in- herited in an autosomally recessive manner. It is characterised by viscid secretions of many organs, in particular the lungs and pan- creas. In the lungs these viscid secretions interfere with the mech- anisms responsible for clearing inhaled material, allowing oppor- tunistic bacteria to establish infections. Important pathogens in- clude Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus au- reus (S.aureus), Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, and many others, with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa being the most prevalent in childhood and adulthood respectively (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry 2011; Guss 2011). It is thought that early infection with P. aeruginosa may be eradicated by antibiotics (Gibson 2003; Langton Hewer 2009; Ratjen 2001), but eventually the infection becomes chronic and can no longer be eradicated. Chronic infec- tion causes persistent symptoms of cough and sputum production and is associated with progressive loss of lung function (Ballmann 1998). In addition, people with CF experience pulmonary exacer- bations, which are characterised by an increase in symptoms (Goss 2007) and reductions in lung function, weight and quality of life (Britto 2002). The causes of these exacerbations are not known, but it is suspected that they may be due, in part, to bacterial in- fection. A standard deﬁnition of what constitutes a pulmonary ex- acerbation has yet to be agreed, but there is reasonable consensus that a pulmonary exacerbation usually consists of people with CF reporting a decline in well-being largely due to respiratory symp- toms that prompts the commencement of a course of antibiotics (Bilton 2011).   Description of the intervention   Pulmonary exacerbations have long been treated with antibiotics and this is currently the recommendation in Europe (Doring 2000) and the USA (Flume 2009). An assumption underlying a corner- stone of CF care is that pulmonary exacerbations are associated with bacterial infection (in particular due to P. aeruginosa), leading to the conclusion that these exacerbations should be treated with antibiotics (Doring 2000). Observational data suggest that oral, in- travenous (IV) and nebulised antibiotics are administered to treat a pulmonary exacerbation (Wagener 2013). When IV antibiotics are used, a combination of two or more different IV antibiotics are recommended; however, the optimal duration of IV antibiotic therapy is unknown (Flume 2009; Elphick 2014; Plummer 2013).   How the intervention might work   Although an accepted deﬁnition of what constitutes a pulmonary exacerbation has yet to be developed, pulmonary exacerbations   are assumed to be caused (at least in part) by bacterial infection. Antibiotics are administered in order to reduce the amount of bac- teria in the lungs that are presumed to be responsible for much of the decline in the individual’s clinical condition (Flume 2009). These antibiotics may, or may not, reduce the amount of bacte- ria in the lungs. There may be many different species of bacteria present (Guss 2011) and these broad-spectrum antibiotics may have variable activity against these bacteria. However, antibiotics may themselves be associated with considerable morbidity includ- ing selecting for antibiotic resistance (Rogues 2007) and causing renal toxicity and ototoxicity (Bertenshaw 2007; Smyth 2014). Prolonged courses of antibiotic treatment may also pose a signiﬁ- cant burden of treatment for people with CF to endure.   Why it is important to do this review   Pulmonary exacerbations are responsible for an accelerated decline in lung function (de Boer 2011) and a signiﬁcant proportion of people experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation who are treated with IV antibiotics, do not recover lung function to baseline ( Sanders 2010). Potential reasons for this include:   • the aetiology of the exacerbation (e.g. viral infection) and so   prevention is the main goal;   • the host (e.g. inﬂammation) so novel therapies might be   developed to modulate the immune system;   • factors related to the treatment, and so we must determine optimal treatments (and routes of treatment) which can include use of IV antibiotics.   Often, IV antibiotics are held to be the most effective form of antibiotic delivery. We wished not only to determine the efﬁcacy of IV antibiotics in treating people with CF experiencing a pul- monary exacerbation, but also to determine the comparative effec- tiveness of the IV route compared against antibiotics administered via oral or inhaled routes. We have reviewed the current evidence that treating such exac- erbations with IV antibiotics improves short-term and long-term clinical outcomes in people with CF.   To establish if IV antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exac- erbations in people with CF improve short- and long-term clinical outcomes.   Criteria for considering studies for this review   We shall include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the ﬁrst treatment cycle of cross-over studies (see Unit of analysis issues) in people with CF experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation.   Types of participants   We will consider people with CF as diagnosed using the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation consensus statement (Rosenstein 1998) of all ages and all degrees of disease severity. There are no universally agreed deﬁnitions for the diagnosis of a pulmonary exacerbation; some criteria are restrictive (Fuchs 1994) (since modiﬁed), while others only require an event needing hospitalisation and IV an- tibiotics due to worsening respiratory signs and symptoms (Brody 2005). We will therefore consider all studies that explicitly aim to trial an IV antibiotic for the treatment of a pulmonary exacerba- tion.   Types of interventions   We shall compare:   • a single IV antibiotic versus placebo; • a combination of IV antibiotics versus placebo; • one regimen of IV antibiotics versus another IV regimen of   antibiotics (with or without placebo);   • an IV antibiotic regimen versus nebulised antibiotics; and • an IV antibiotic regimen versus oral antibiotics.   Studies that exclusively compare different doses of the same an- tibiotic will be excluded (post hoc change).   Types of outcome measures   1. Lung function   i) forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) ii) forced vital capacity (FVC)   2. Time to next exacerbation (although as there is no agreed   deﬁnition of pulmonary exacerbations, we shall accept the individual clinicians’ diagnosis, acknowledging the inherent difﬁculties that this poses)   3. Quality of life (e.g. Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised   3. Adherence (all measures) 4. Mortality (CF-related and all causes) 5. Adverse effects   i) toxicity and allergy - e.g. idiosyncratic reaction,   allergy, decline in renal function   ii) microbiological - isolation of antibiotic resistant   strains, or new strains of bacteria   Search methods for identiﬁcation of studies   Electronic searches   We identiﬁed relevant studies from the Group’s Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register using the terms: antibiotics AND (intravenous OR not stated) AND (acute treatment [pulmonary exacerbations] OR unknown). The Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of The Cochrane Library), weekly searches of MEDLINE, a search of Embase to 1995 and the prospective handsearching of two journals - Pediatric Pulmonology and the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis. Unpublished work is identiﬁed by searching the abstract books of three major cystic ﬁbrosis con- ferences: the International Cystic Fibrosis Conference; the Euro- pean Cystic Fibrosis Conference and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant sections of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Module. Date of the latest search: 27 July 2015. We also searched the clinical trials registers: ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN; and EudraCT for ongoing trials using the search terms: cystic ﬁbrosis AND antibiotics. Date of the latest search: 02 July 2014.   Searching other resources   We searched the reference lists of all included studies to identify other studies for potential inclusion.

Two investigators (MH, AP) independently considered the full text reports of the remaining studies. They examined each study for potential inclusion and for consideration of multiple   reporting by comparing reports using author names, study loca- tion, intervention details and date of the study as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a).

If it had been possible, they planned to assess adherence by calculating odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs. Other dichotomous outcomes would have been reported by the calculation of ORs with 95% CIs.   Data extraction and management   Two authors (MH, AP) independently extracted the data from the included studies on a separate study report form and compared the output. They resolved any disagreement through discussion. Where one paper presented data graphically, the authors extracted the data they required using XYPLOT (a graphics-based computer programme where data points may be extracted using the scale of axes as reference points) (XYPLOT 2010) and then entered data into the Review Manager software to be analysed (RevMan 2014).   Assessment of risk of bias in included studies   While interrogating each study report for the extraction of data, the authors also noted information regarding the conduct and de- sign of each study in order to implement the Cochrane Collabo- ration’s risk of bias tool (Higgins 2011b). This tool facilitates the assessment of biases introduced through inadequacies in random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of partici- pants and study personnel, blinding of outcome assessments, re- porting of incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. As with data extraction, the two investigators extracted this informa- tion with the same process for comparison and resolution of dis- parity. They were not blinded to the authors of each study. In some instances more information is required and in future the review authors will attempt to contact the study authors or sponsors for more detail to be included in updates of this review. All investiga- tors agreed the ﬁnal judgement regarding whether any individual bias or group of biases imposes a material bias impacting upon the results and conclusions of a study, informed by the empirical evidence, likely direction and magnitude of any bias.   Measures of treatment effect   The authors assessed continuous outcomes (lung function, nutri- tional status, quality of life and symptom scores) by the calcula- tion of mean difference (MD) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs). Where trials reported multiple measures for the same outcome (e.g. absolute change FEV1 per cent (%) predicted, or absolute change of absolute FEV1 volumes) the review authors calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs). In the event that individ- ual participant data had been available, the authors would have considered absolute changes in FEV1 in context of comparable data being available for each participant before and after the in- tervention so that a calculation of the effect size was possible. If the data allowed, the authors would have extracted or calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for the outcome ’Time to next   Unit of analysis issues   The authors aimed to only consider the ﬁrst pulmonary exacerba- tion for each participant, taking the measure of effect as the dif- ference between baseline and the end of treatment. The optimal duration of therapy is yet to be established and so the authors con- sidered the end of therapy measurement (as deﬁned in the study) as the unit of analysis. In the case of cross-over studies they aimed to consider only the ﬁrst phase of participation, as participants may not recover lung function to baseline (Sanders 2010) and, in addition to introducing a unit of analysis error, multiple treat- ment episodes may not be comparable. In effect, these studies re- main listed in Studies awaiting classiﬁcation as the authors await data to include in the analysis. In order to compare interventions of differing durations the authors aimed, given sufﬁcient compa- rable studies reporting these data, to combine outcome data for comparisons at two weeks, three months and one year after the exacerbation. If future studies consistently report this, they shall undertake this analysis in future updates.   Dealing with missing data   When possible the review authors aimed to contact the study au- thors for data that appeared to be missing. Where only mean val- ues and standard deviations (SDs) before and after treatment were available, they imputed the SD of the mean change using a cor- relation coefﬁcient as described in theCochrane Handbook for Sys- tematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a). For the calcu- lation of a correlation coefﬁcient for studies that reported FEV1 and FVC in terms of % predicted, the authors used data from the 1988 Bosso study, as this study reported the mean and SD for pre- treatment and post-treatment and also the SD of the mean change (Bosso 1988). Similarly, for studies that reported FEV1 and FVC in absolute change (litres) the authors used data from the 1987 Hodson study (Hodson 1987). When appropriate to do so, the authors may remedy missing data by the imputation of replace- ment values (e.g. using the mean value for a treatment group). Where possible they will conduct intention-to-treat analyses.   Assessment of heterogeneity   Where the review authors were able to perform a meta-analysis with multiple studies suitable for inclusion, they attempted to identify statistical heterogeneity by calculating a Chi2 test and us- ing this value to compute an I2 statistic (Higgins 2003). They inter- preted this value based on thresholds as identiﬁed in theCochrane   Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2011): 0% to 40% as probably not important; 30% to 60% as moderate het- erogeneity; 50% to 90% as substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% as considerable heterogeneity. The authors also considered sources of heterogeneity within the characteristics of the included studies.   Assessment of reporting biases   The review authors used multiple search methods to identify pub- lished studies and also aimed to contact the authors of all included studies in an attempt to identify studies that may not have been published. They also aimed to contact the authors of any study published only in abstract form for study data. Where available, they attempted to identify evidence of outcome reporting biases by the comparison of the published report to the study protocol. They further attempted to identify reporting biases by the con- struction and inspection of funnel plots for asymmetry and in- terpreting them in the context of study sizes, and methodological rigour (Sterne 2011).   Data synthesis   The authors conducted separate meta-analyses for the grouped comparisons as detailed above (Types of interventions). They con- ducted a ﬁxed-effect method meta-analysis to combine the mea- sures of effect for the outcomes of study. In the case of at least substantial heterogeneity (as deﬁned above), they would have em- ployed a random-effects method. The authors used the inverse variance method of meta-analysis for continuous data and the Mantel-Haenzsel method for dichoto- mous data as the default ﬁxed-effect methods in RevMan. The authors would have used the generic inverse variance method for the outcome ’time to next pulmonary exacerbation’ if data had been available for analysis.   Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity   In the case that the authors had identiﬁed a sufﬁcient number of studies (i.e. 10), they would have undertaken subgroup analyses for the following groups:   • bacteria isolated at time of exacerbation P. aeruginosa versus   non P. aeruginosa;   • severity of lung disease based on a composite of age and FEV1 to delineate ’severe’ and ’mild’ as classiﬁed by Schluchter (Schluchter 2006); and   • age of participants (children (less than 18 years of age) and   adults).   Sensitivity analysis   Again, if the authors had identiﬁed a sufﬁcient number of stud- ies for inclusion, they would have investigated the effect of arbi- trary decisions made by the review team by undertaking sensitivity   analyses of the affected components. In the case where they de- cided to manage missing data by the imputation of data, if possi- ble they would have investigated the effect of these manipulations by repeating the analyses without these imputations. In the case of determining the effect of arbitrary decisions the authors made, for example by including all studies of pulmonary exacerbations instead of limiting selection only to those with stricter diagnos- tic criteria, they would have repeated the analyses limited to the stricter diagnostic criteria.   Summary of ﬁndings tables   In a post hoc change the authors have presented three summary of ﬁndings tables - one comparing single and combination IV antibi- otics, one comparing nebulised and IV antibiotics and one com- paring oral and IV antibiotics (Summary of ﬁndings for the main comparison; Summary of ﬁndings 3; Summary of ﬁndings 2). The authors calculated the assumed risk as the mean of the effect size of the control group in each study; the corresponding risk being the result of the meta-analysis as presented in the data tables. The au- thors determined the study quality using the GRADE approach, where quality was rated with regard to risk of bias or study lim- itations, directness, consistency of results, precision, publication bias and effect size. They downgraded the evidence by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations.   Description of studies   For study details please refer to the tables (Characteristics of included studies; Characteristics of excluded studies; Characteristics of studies awaiting classiﬁcation).   Results of the search   The original search (November 2011) identiﬁed 180 publications and a later search (July 2014) identiﬁed a further 12. The search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Trials Reg- ister in 2015 did not identify any new publications. A search of the reference lists of these publications (and reviewing other pub- lications included within the same supplementary journal issues) identiﬁed a further 17 published reports. Of these 209 published reports, of which some were duplicate reports of the same study, we identiﬁed 134 individual studies. We were able to exclude 82 studies after reviewing the abstracts or full reports (132 references) for the reasons stated below (Excluded studies). There were 40 trials (62 references) that met our inclusion criteria; 12 studies (15 references) await classiﬁcation (see PRISMA diagram Figure 1).   Included studies   A total of 40 studies (n = 1717) were included in the review ( Characteristics of included studies). Many of the included studies are older, with only three studies reporting since 2000 (Blumer 2005; Master 2001; Semykin 2010).   A total of 14 studies were described as double-blind and a further seven studies were single-blind (an additional four involved a single assessment modality that was blinded); the remaining 18 studies were unblinded. All studies were of a parallel design; cross-over studies are awaiting pending data for inclusion (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classiﬁcation). Most of the studies were single-centre studies; however, one study had two centres (McLaughlin 1983) and a further ﬁve studies were multi-centre (three or more centres) (Blumer 2005; BTS 1985; Church 1997; Richard 1997; Smith 1999). The majority of studies were conducted either in Western Europe (n = 17) or the USA (n = 15) with the remaining studies taking place in Canada (n = 4), Australia (n = 2), New Zealand (n = 1), Russia (n = 1) and one study was multinational (Richard 1997). A total of 33 studies compared two groups of participants, ﬁve studies compared three groups (Costantini 1982; McLaughlin 1983; Padoan 1987; Semykin 2010; Wang 1988) and a further two studies had four arms (Macfarlane 1985) and seven arms ( Agostini 1983). The duration of the interventions ranged from three days (Caplan 1984) to 15 days (Agostini 1983; Costantini 1982; Schaad 1987), although the vast majority of studies reported an administration of antibiotics of 14 days.   The included studies involved a total of 1717 participants. How- ever, many of these studies each recruited only a small number of participants; indeed, 28 studies recruited fewer than 50 partic- ipants. The largest study randomised 147 participants (Agostini 1983), while the smallest recruited just 13 participants (Wesley 1988). Five studies included only children (which we deﬁned as younger than 18 years) (Church 1997; Knowles 1988; Padoan 1987; Semykin 2010; Wesley 1988) and four studies recruited only adults (Bosso 1989; Hodson 1987; Penketh 1984; Wang 1988). The re- maining studies admitted participants of all ages. Where data were available regarding gender split, groups were largely equally split, except for ﬁve studies where males were predominant (Gold 1985; Penketh 1984; Regelmann 1990; Salh 1992; Stephens 1983) and three studies where females were predominant (Gold 1987; Huang 1983; Padoan 1987).   Few studies described the disease severity of the participants; those that did largely did so on the basis of FEV1 (Blumer 2005; Church 1997; Conway 1997), while two explicitly enrolled those with “se- vere” disease (Padoan 1987; Wesley 1988). Other studies actively excluded those with severe disease; two studies excluded those with protocol-deﬁned severe disease (Gold 1985; Schaad 1986), while a further two studies did so on the basis of lung function - one excluded those with FEV1 less than 40% predicted (Master 2001) and the second excluded those with FEV1 less than 20% predicted (Penketh 1984). One study excluded those who had been admit- ted to hospital more recently than four months prior to the current admission (Schaad 1989).   IV antibiotic versus placebo   We identiﬁed seven studies that investigated the activity of an IV antibiotic regimen with a placebo in the comparison (Gold 1987; Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; McLaughlin 1983; Regelmann 1990; Smith 1999; Wientzen 1980). While three of these were direct comparisons of an intervention versus placebo (Gold 1987; Regelmann 1990; Wientzen 1980), four trials involved a placebo drug as part of an IV antibiotic combination, thereby attempting to consider the effect of single active agent versus combination agent treatment and are further discussed in the section below (Single IV antibiotic versus combination IV antibiotic) (Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; McLaughlin 1983; Smith 1999).   Single IV antibiotic versus placebo   Two studies involved a direct comparison between a single antibi- otic (ceftazidime and tobramycin respectively) and placebo (Gold 1987; Wientzen 1980).   Combination of IV antibiotics versus placebo   One further study compared an antibiotic combination (to- bramycin and ticarcillin) and placebo (Regelmann 1990) .   IV antibiotic regimens compared   A total of 29 studies compared multiple IV antibiotic regimens.   Single IV antibiotic regimens compared   Six studies compared two (or more) different single antibiotic regimens (Agostini 1983; Caplan 1984; Costantini 1982; Elborn 1992; Huang 1983; Salh 1992). One study compared ﬁve different antibiotics - azlocillin versus piperacillin versus ceftazidime versus cefsulodin versus cefoperazone (Agostini 1983); a further study compared cefsulodin to tobramycin or ticarcillin (Caplan 1984). The remaining three studies compared two single IV antibiotics: ceftazidime versus aztreonam (Elborn 1992); carbenicillin versus azlocillin (Huang 1983); and ceftazidime versus aztreonam (Salh 1992). Two arms of the Costantini trial compared carbenicillin alone to sisomycin alone (Costantini 1982).   Single IV antibiotic versus combination IV antibiotic   Four studies involved a placebo drug as part of an IV antibiotic combination, thereby attempting to consider the effect of sin- gle active agent versus combination agent treatment (Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; McLaughlin 1983; Smith 1999). Hyatt studied oxacillin in combination with placebo compared to a combina- tion of oxacillin, sisomycin and carbenicillin (Hyatt 1981). Mac- Farlane considered two doses of piperacillin (50 mg/kg six times daily and 100 mg/kg three times daily) each in combination with tobramycin compared to tobramycin with placebo (Macfarlane 1985). McLaughlin compared the combination of ticarcillin and tobramycin to a combination of azlocillin and tobramycin and further compared these with azlocillin and placebo (McLaughlin 1983). In the ﬁnal study, Smith considered the combination of azlocillin and tobramycin compared with azlocillin and placebo (Smith 1999). A total of 12 separate studies compared a single IV antibiotic with a combination of two IV antibiotics; of these ﬁve investigated the use of combination antibiotic treatment by comparing the effect of a single antibiotic with the same antibiotic in combination with another agent (Conway 1997; Costantini 1982; Master 2001; McCarty 1988; Padoan 1987) and seven compared a single agent to two different antibiotics in combination (Bosso 1988; BTS 1985; De Boeck 1989; De Boeck 1999; Gold 1985; Padoan 1987; Wesley 1988). One study consisted of multiple comparison arms which fall into both these comparisons (Padoan 1987). Another, compared a combination of IV antibiotics with a different IV antibiotic followed by the same antibiotic in oral form (Church 1997). The antibiotics and their combinations used were varied, none of the studies comparing a single IV antibiotic to combination IV an- tibiotics used the same single agent. One study compared colistin alone to a combination of colistin with either aztreonam, azlocillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipinem, or ciproﬂoxacin (Conway 1997). A second study compared tobramycin to tobramycin with ceftazidime (Master 2001). A further study compared piperacillin to piperacillin with tobramycin (McCarty 1988). In addition to   the two single-agent comparison arms of the Costantini trial men- tioned above (carbenicillin alone to sisomycin alone), the trial also compared each single agent alone to carbenicillin combined with sisomycin (Costantini 1982). A further trial with multiple com- parison arms compared ceftazidime alone to ceftazidime with si- somycin (Padoan 1987). The seven studies comparing a single agent with a combination of two different antibiotics also used a range of different agents. Ceftazidime was used as the single agent in ﬁve studies, it was compared to: gentamicin plus carbenicillin (BTS 1985); tobramycin plus piperacillin (De Boeck 1989); to- bramycin plus ticarcillin (Gold 1985; Wesley 1988) and, in ad- dition to the comparison discussed above, to piperacillin plus si- somycin (Padoan 1987). Ceftazidime was also used in combina- tion with tobramycin and compared to meropenem alone in one study (De Boeck 1999). The ﬁnal study compared aztreonam to tobramycin plus azlocillin (Bosso 1988).   Combination IV antibiotic regimens compared   Nine studies compared two combinations of two different IV antibiotics (Blumer 2005; Conway 1985; McLaughlin 1983; Penketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Schaad 1986; Schaad 1989; Semykin 2010; Wang 1988). Again the IV antibiotics used were varied. Two studies administered a combination of netilmicin and ticarcillin, but compared these to tobramycin and ticarcillin (Conway 1985) and netilmicin and azlocillin (Schaad 1986). Two studies by the same lead author compared carbenicillin and gen- tamicin to other IV antibiotic combinations, ﬁrstly, carbenicillin plus gentamicin versus ticarcillin plus gentamicin (Penketh 1983) and secondly carbenicillin plus gentamicin versus azlocillin plus gentamicin (Penketh 1984). The remaining two studies compared meropenem plus tobramycin versus ceftazidime plus tobramycin (Blumer 2005) and aztreonam plus amikacin versus ceftazidime plus amikacin (Schaad 1989). Semykin compared IV cefepime plus IV amikacin to IV meropenem plus IV amikacin, in addition to a nebulised antibiotic arm (discussed below) (Semykin 2010). McLaughlin considered the combination of ticarcillin plus to- bramycin compared with azlocillin plus tobramycin (as well as an- other arm with a placebo as discussed above) (McLaughlin 1983).   IV antibiotic regimen versus nebulised antibiotics   A total of ﬁve studies compared IV antibiotics to nebulised antibi- otics. One study compared an IV antibiotic regimen with an inhaled an- tibiotic regimen using IV tobramycin and ticarcillin compared to inhaled tobramycin and inhaled carbenicillin (Cooper 1985). Four studies investigated the effect of inhaled antibiotics as an adjunct to intravenous antibiotic use (Knowles 1988; Schaad 1987; Semykin 2010; Stephens 1983). Knowles compared IV piperacillin and IV tobramycin to IV piperacillin and IV tobramycin with the addition of these same antibiotics delivered by nebuliser (Knowles 1988).   Similarly, Stephens compared IV ticarcillin and IV tobramycin to IV ticarcillin and IV tobramycin with the addition of inhaled to- bramycin (Stephens 1983) and Schaad compared IV ceftazidime and IV amikacin to IV ceftazidime and IV amikacin with the ad- dition of inhaled amikacin (Schaad 1987). The fourth study to compare IV antibiotics to nebulised antibiotics compared IV ce- fepime with IV amikacin to IV meropenem and IV amikacin and also to inhaled tobramycin given alongside IV ceftazidime and oral ciproﬂoxacin (Semykin 2010).   IV antibiotic regimen versus oral antibiotics   Six studies compared IV antibiotics to oral antibiotics. Four studies compared oral ciproﬂoxacin with two-agent IV com- binations (Bosso 1989; Hodson 1987; Richard 1997; Wang 1988). One study compared oral ciproﬂoxacin to IV azlocillin with gen- tamicin (Hodson 1987) and another study compared it to IV cef- tazidime with tobramycin (Richard 1997). A further study com- pared oral ciproﬂoxacin to IV tobramycin with azlocillin (Bosso 1989) and the remaining study had a three-arm comparison of oral ciproﬂoxacin to IV tobramycin with azlocillin and to IV to- bramycin and ticarcillin (Wang 1988). A ﬁfth study compared oral ciproﬂoxacin with oral ciproﬂoxacin cycled with IV tobramycin with azlocillin (Black 1990). One study compared IV ciproﬂoxacin followed by oral ciproﬂoxacin to IV tobramycin with IV ceftazidime (Church 1997).   Multiple comparisons   Among the studies described above, six included multiple com- parisons within a single study (Church 1997; Costantini 1982; McLaughlin 1983; Padoan 1987; Semykin 2010; Wang 1988). Church compared single agent IV ciproﬂoxacin followed by sin- gle agent oral ciproﬂoxacin with combination treatment with IV tobramycin and IV ceftazidime with multiple reporting periods thus comparing both single with combination IV agents and oral compared with IV (Church 1997). Costantini compared IV car- benicillin to IV sisomycin each as single agents and to IV carbeni- cillin with sisomycin combined (Costantini 1982). McLaughlin compared IV ticarcillin with IV azlocillin each in combination with IV tobramycin and also with a third comparison group of IV azlocillin in combination with placebo (McLaughlin 1983). Padoan compared IV ceftazidime to IV ceftazidime with sisomycin and to IV piperacillin with sisomycin (Padoan 1987). Semykin compared IV cefepime with IV amikacin to IV meropenem and IV amikacin and to inhaled tobramycin given alongside IV cef- tazidime and oral ciproﬂoxacin (Semykin 2010). Wang studied oral ciproﬂoxacin compared to IV tobramycin with ticarcillin and to IV tobramycin with azlocillin (Wang 1988).   Some of the earlier studies reported clinical status in the form of a ’clinical score’. These were not standardised or validated and the components of the scores varied between studies. Many studies did not report absolute values of measures, instead detailing the results of a statistical comparison between groups. Lung function was the most commonly reported outcome (32 studies); however, this was variably reported as either percentage change or absolute change in either % predicted or absolute val- ues of FEV1 or FVC. This made comparing the results of similar studies difﬁcult. In addition, few studies reported means and mea- sures of distribution of all lung function measurements - initial, end measurements and a measure of the change over time. Where necessary we imputed the SDs for change using a correlation co- efﬁcient that was calculated from those studies that did report the requisite information, namely for data reported as FEV1 % pre- dicted, a correlation coefﬁcient was calculated using data from the Bosso study (Bosso 1989) and for data reported as absolute values, a correlation coefﬁcient was calculated using data in the Hodson study (Hodson 1987). Studies infrequently reported nutritional status and again variously - either in absolute terms or as a measure of % underweight. Time- to-next exacerbation was reported in only eight studies; and then with data suitable for use in a meta-analysis only available from two studies (De Boeck 1989; McLaughlin 1983). Two studies report rates of re-admission in the three months following the study (BTS 1985; Wesley 1988). Three studies report a statistical test without supporting data (Penketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Smith 1999). Adverse effects were variably reported in 26 studies, consisting of either speciﬁc reports of toxicities (ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity) (Penketh 1983; Regelmann 1990; Schaad 1987; Schaad 1989), screens for general toxicities using serum markers of liver and renal function or reports of side effects (Agostini 1983; Black 1990; Bosso 1988; BTS 1985; Caplan 1984; Conway 1997; Costantini 1982; Huang 1983; Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; Master 2001; Padoan 1987; Penketh 1983; Schaad 1986; Schaad 1987; Wang 1988; Wesley 1988), or discussion of bacterial resistance patterns (Church 1997; Gold 1985; Hodson 1987; McLaughlin 1983; Penketh 1984; Salh 1992; Stephens 1983). Mortality was reported in seven studies (Caplan 1984; Conway 1985; De Boeck 1989; Hyatt 1981; McLaughlin 1983; Penketh 1984; Wientzen 1980). Quality of life and adherence were not reported in any study.   Excluded studies   A total of 82 studies were excluded (Characteristics of excluded studies). Fifteen studies were not randomised (or were quasi-ran- domised) (Cabezudo 1984; Hoogkamp-Korstanje 1983; Jackson 1986; Jewett 1985; Krause 1979; Kuni 1992; Levy 1982a; Martin 1980; Michalsen 1981; Parry 1977; Popa 2001; Postnikov 2001; Postnikov 2001a; Rubio 1987; Shatunov 2001). Six studies related to treatment location, e.g. at home versus in hospital (Amelina   2000; Davis 1990; Donati 1987; Hjelte 1988; Klettke 1999; Wolter 1997). Seven studies were excluded since they did not in- clude participants being treated for pulmonary exacerbations in both comparison arms (Brett 1992; Byrne 1995; Elborn 2000; Jensen 1987; Pedersen 1986; Permin 1983; Yasmin 1974). Five studies did not include an IV antibiotic comparator (Day 1988; Gold 1983; Heaf 1984; Levy 1982; Nikonova 2010). Two were excluded as the comparison was one of process; bronchoscopy- guided management (Wainwright 2011) or pharmacist versus self-care (Ramstrom 2000). Three studies were observational or non-intervention studies (Dodge 1983; Hatziagorou 2013; Moss 1991) and two studies were in vitro studies (Aaron 2005; Balsamo 1986). The remaining 42 studies relate to dosing studies or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies or toxicity stud- ies (Adeboyeku 2011; Al-Ansari 2006; Aminimanizani 2002; Beringer 2003; Beringer 2010; Burkhardt 2006; Canis 1998; Christensson 1992; Conway 1996a; Davis 1987; De Boeck 1998; Degg 1996; Eron 1983; Goldfarb 1987; Guglielmo 1996; Hamner 2006; Heininger 1993; Hubert 2009; Ivanov 1997; Jacobs 1985; Keel 2011; Kercsmar 1983; Kruger 2001; Kuzemko 1989; Labiris 2004; Li 1991; McCabe 2013; Mouton 1991; Nikolaizik 2005; Padoan 1988; Postnikov 2007; Powell 1983; Prayle 2013; Reed 1987; Reed 1987a; Riethmueller 2009; Roberts 1992; Smyth 2005; Turner 2013; Whitehead 2002; Winnie 1991; Wood 1996).   For 12 studies (15 references) we were unable to make a deci- sion regarding inclusion or exclusion. For four of the studies it was unclear if the study was randomised (Crawley 2005; Huang 1979; Kapranov 1995; Vic 1997). We are awaiting data that report includable participant episodes in the case of the four cross-over studies (Al-Aloul 2005; Dinwiddie 1982; Döring 1995; Geborek 2003), one of which included a placebo arm (Döring 1995), and also the two studies that report multiple indications (e.g. exac- erbations and suppressive regimens) (Latzin 2008; Parry 1978). The Beaudry study met our eligibility criteria, but did not report any outcomes listed in this review (Beaudry 1980). Finally, one abstract was cited in the reference list of a further article, we have not been able to access this abstract yet and as such details about participants, methods and interventions are still unclear (Harris 1984). In these cases we shall contact the study investigators for clariﬁcation or additional data and will make a decision regarding inclusion or exclusion based upon the responses received.   Risk of bias in included studies   The assessment of risk of bias in the included studies is summarised in the ﬁgures (Figure 2; Figure 3).   Figure 2.

All studies were described as being randomised, although few de- scribed the method of generating the allocation sequence. Hence most included studies have been classiﬁed as being at an unclear risk of bias for this domain. In two studies, while it was stated that randomisation was carried out by pharmacists, the details of the method were not described and so the authors considered the risk of bias to be unclear (McLaughlin 1983; Salh 1992). A further study stratiﬁed randomisation by disease severity and age; how- ever, again the method of randomisation used was not stated and so this study was also considered to be at an unclear risk of bias (Master 2001). Six studies were judged to be at a low risk of bias for sequence generation; four studies used a table of random numbers (Gold 1985; Hyatt 1981; Regelmann 1990; Wientzen 1980) and a further two were randomised by a randomisation code (Huang 1983; Smith 1999).   Four studies described either sequentially numbered envelopes or opaque envelopes as a mechanism for concealing allocation af- ter randomisation (BTS 1985; McCarty 1988; McLaughlin 1983; Salh 1992). While no study used both sequential numbering or   made clear that the envelopes were opaque, the authors regarded these studies to be at a low risk of bias with regard to allocation con- cealment. One study stated that both the antibiotics and placebo were prepared in the pharmacy and delivered in coded bottles; the code was not broken in case of ’treatment failure’ (Hyatt 1981). This study was also considered to have a low risk of bias from allocation concealment. All other studies were considered to be at an unclear risk of bias due to insufﬁcient information.   Fourteen studies were described as double blind. Six of these stud- ies involved the preparation of identical syringes or infusions pre- pared in pharmacy with adequate blinding of outcome assessment and so we felt them to be at a low risk of bias (Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; Master 2001; Salh 1992; Smith 1999; Wientzen 1980). We judged the remaining eight studies which were described as double-blind to have an unclear risk of bias. The Gold study at- tempted to blind both participants and outcome assessors; how- ever, participant blinding was potentially compromised by partic- ipants being able to detect a characteristic odour from urine when they were treated with ceftazidime (Gold 1987). The effect of this has been classiﬁed as ’unclear’ as it is unknown what proportion of participants had previously received ceftazidime and noticed the characteristic change (or otherwise); although it is noted that three   participants who withdrew had correctly guessed that they were receiving placebo due to absence of urine odour. The Regelmann study involved the generation of sham drug levels, although no further detail was given and so we considered the study to also be at an unclear risk of bias (Regelmann 1990). The remaining six trials did not describe the method of participant blinding and so the risk of bias is also considered to be unclear (Agostini 1983; Church 1997; Huang 1983; McLaughlin 1983; Padoan 1987; Wesley 1988). Eight studies were considered to be at a high risk of both per- formance and detection bias due to an open study design (Bosso 1988; Bosso 1989; BTS 1985; Conway 1985; McCarty 1988; Penketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Richard 1997).   Seven studies were considered to be at a low risk of performance bias due to adequate evidence of blinding of participants (Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; Master 2001; McLaughlin 1983; Salh 1992; Smith 1999; Wientzen 1980); 13 studies were considered to be at a high risk of performance bias due to no blinding of partici- pants (Bosso 1988; Bosso 1989; BTS 1985; Caplan 1984; Conway 1985; Conway 1997; De Boeck 1989; Gold 1985; Knowles 1988; McCarty 1988; Penketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Richard 1997). With the remaining 20 studies we were unable to make an assess- ment due to insufﬁcient information.   Thirteen studies were considered to be at a low risk of detection bias due to adequate evidence of outcome assessor blinding (De Boeck 1989; Gold 1985; Gold 1987; Hyatt 1981; Macfarlane 1985; Master 2001; McLaughlin 1983; Salh 1992; Schaad 1987; Schaad 1989; Smith 1999; Stephens 1983; Wientzen 1980). Eight studies were considered to be at a high risk of detection bias due to an open study design (Bosso 1988; Bosso 1989; BTS 1985; Conway 1985; McCarty 1988; Penketh 1983; Penketh 1984; Richard 1997). With the remaining 19 studies we were unable to make an assessment due to insufﬁcient information.   Incomplete outcome data   Twelve studies were considered to be at a low risk of attrition bias; eight studies documented that there were no participants who withdrew during the study period and as such are considered to be at a low risk of bias (Bosso 1988; Caplan 1984; De Boeck 1989; Gold 1985; Hodson 1987; McCarty 1988; Penketh 1984; Schaad 1987). A further four studies reported an intention-to-treat anal- ysis, or reported the last contributed data for those who withdrew and so are also considered to be at a low risk of bias (Conway 1997; Hyatt 1981; Master 2001; Richard 1997). Fourteen stud- ies did not include participants who withdrew in the analysis (or where incomplete data are presented) and are considered to be   at a high risk of bias (Agostini 1983; Blumer 2005; Bosso 1989; BTS 1985; Church 1997; Gold 1987; Huang 1983; Macfarlane 1985; McLaughlin 1983; Regelmann 1990; Schaad 1986; Schaad 1989; Smith 1999; Wientzen 1980). In some analyses this effect reaches a considerable proportion of the overall study group, as exempliﬁed by the four studies contributing to the analysis of sin- gle IV antibiotics in combination with placebo versus combina- tion IV antibiotics where 23% of participants do not contribute to the ﬁnal analysis. Also in the comparison of a single agent (no placebo) versus an antibiotic combination, there were 10 studies (345 participants) reporting on FEV1; however only four studies with 152 participants contribute to the analysis. Additionally, in the Wientzen study two participants died in the placebo group (one on Day 1 and the second on Day 4). Due to the small study size this is surprising and so suggests either a failure of random allocation or a difference in the characteristics of the comparator groups at baseline (Wientzen 1980). In the Regelmann study, one participant was withdrawn by the attending physician for “failing to improve rapidly enough”. Furthermore of the 15 participants, only four in the placebo group and eight in the antibiotic group contribute data to the ﬁnal analysis at two weeks (Regelmann 1990). Both studies are therefore considered to be at high risk of bias in the domain of incomplete outcome data. The remaining 15 studies did not report details concerning with- drawals or adequacy of reporting to allow an assessment to be made.   Selective reporting   The inadequate reporting of studies made it difﬁcult to reach a decision regarding selective reporting in the majority of instances. This was largely due to many of the included studies being un- dertaken prior to the establishment of trial registries and routine archiving of study protocols. In two studies it was clear that lung function data had been recorded but not reported (Black 1990; Caplan 1984) and another stated that time-to-next exacerbation data were recorded, but not reported (Knowles 1988). We consid- ered these studies to have a high risk of bias. We were unable to retrieve the protocols for any study and so were unable to deter- mine a study to be at a low risk of bias.   Other potential sources of bias   An additional issue with the outcomes addressed in this review is the heterogeneity with which they are reported, not only in terms of the wide variety of units for change in lung function (absolute change, percentage change in absolute values (litres), per cent change in % predicted values) but also the variety of measures reported (BMI, weight, proportion underweight) that make contributing studies to a meta-analysis challenging. A unit of analysis issue was introduced in 20 studies which involved people who participated on more than one occasion",

         "BACKGROUND\nThe rate of successful pregnancies brought to term has barely increased since the first assisted reproductive technology (ART) technique became available. Research suggests that vasodilators may increase endometrial receptivity, thicken the endometrium, and favour uterine relaxation, all of which could improve the chances of successful assisted pregnancy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vasodilators in women undergoing fertility treatment.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two clinical trial registries in April 2024, with no language or date restrictions. We also searched grey literature sources and checked the reference lists of relevant articles.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vasodilators (alone or combined with other treatments) versus placebo or no treatment or versus other agents in women undergoing fertility treatment.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and calculated risk ratios (RRs). We combined study data using a fixed-effect model and assessed evidence certainty using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy and vasodilator side effects. Our secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, endometrial thickness, multiple gestation, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 45 studies with a total of 4404 women. The included studies compared a vasodilator versus a placebo or no treatment (40 RCTs), vasodilators plus another agent versus placebo or no treatment (3 RCTs) or versus oestrogens (3 RCTs). The mean length of follow-up was 15.45 weeks. Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low to moderate. The main limitations were imprecision (low number of events and participants) and risk of bias (lack of blinding in studies that reported subjective outcomes). Vasodilators versus placebo or no treatment Vasodilators may result in little to no difference in rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.58; I² = 0%; 6 RCTs, 740 women; low-certainty evidence), but probably increase overall rates of side effects (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.98; I² = 0%; 7 RCTs, 668 women; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that 246 per 1000 women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy with a placebo or no treatment, and 229 to 389 per 1000 will do so using vasodilators. Vasodilators compared with placebo or no treatment likely increase rates of clinical pregnancy (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.64; I² = 22%; 25 RCTs, 2506 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Vasodilators compared with placebo or no treatment probably have little or no effect on rates of multiple gestation or birth (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.55; I² = 0%; 7 RCTs, 763 women; moderate-certainty evidence), miscarriage (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.74; I² = 0%; 8 RCTs; 829 women; moderate-certainty evidence), and ectopic pregnancy (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.59; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, 543 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Most studies found a beneficial effect of vasodilators for endometrial thickness, but the reported effect estimates varied (I² = 93%), from a mean difference of 0.47 mm higher (95% CI 0.90 mm lower to 1. 84 mm higher) to 1.94 mm higher (95% CI 1.37 higher to 2.51 mm higher), and the evidence was very uncertain. Hence, we are unsure how to interpret these results. Vasodilators versus oestrogens Vasodilators compared with oestrogens may have little or no effect on rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.33; 1 RCT, 44 women, low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of sildenafil compared with oestrogens on clinical pregnancy rates (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.38; I² = 59%; 3 RCTs, 262 women; very low-certainty evidence), endometrial thickness (RR 1.90, 95 CI 1.15 to 3.13; 1 RCT, 120 women; very low-certainty evidence) and miscarriage rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.12; 1 RCT, 44 women; very low-certainty evidence) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Among women undergoing fertility treatment, there may be little or no difference in the rate of live birth or ongoing pregnancy in those who receive vasodilators compared with those who receive a placebo or no treatment, and compared with those who receive oestrogens. Compared with placebo or no treatment, vasodilators likely increase rates of clinical pregnancy, but probably also increase overall rates of side effects. The evidence on clinical pregnancy with vasodilators versus oestrogens is very uncertain, and we found no evidence on overall side effects for the comparison of vasodilators versus oestrogens. We are unsure about the effect of vasodilators versus placebo or no treatment and versus oestrogens on endometrial thickness. Vasodilators versus placebo or no treatment probably have little or no effect on multiple gestation or birth, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy. Future studies should be adequately randomised and powered to ensure a more accurate evaluation of each treatment, with live births as a primary outcome.",

A  total\nof  1,144,858  babies  were  reported  to  have  been  born  worldwide\nin  2008,  2009,  and  2010  (Dyer  2016).  Worldwide,  ART  practices\nare  characterised  by  outcome  differences  between  regions.  By\n2012-2013,  fresh  cycle  live  birth  rates  were  highest  in  the  United\nStates  (29%)  and  lowest  in  Japan  (5%)  (Kushnir  2017).  In  the  17\nEuropean  countries  that  report  the  number  of  ART  procedures,\npractitioners  performed  374,177  ART  cycles  in  a  population  of\n310  million  (1175  cycles  per  million).  In  these  countries,  the\nclinical pregnancy rates for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) per aspiration\nand  per  transfer  were  29.6%  and  34.5%,  respectively.  Those  for\nintracytoplasmic  sperm  injection  (ICSI)  were  27.8%  and  32.9%\n(European IVF-Monitoring Consortium (EIM) 2017). Statistics have\nbeen very similar in recent years (de Mouzon 2012; ESHIRE 2016;\nFerraretti 2012; Ferraretti 2013; Sullivan 2013).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAccording  to  the  World  Health  Organization,  medically  assisted\nreproduction  is  defined  as  reproduction  brought  about  through\novulation  induction,  controlled  ovarian  stimulation,  ovulation\ntriggering,  insemination,  and  ART  techniques  (Zegers-Hochschild\n2009;  Zegers-Hochschild  2017).  ART  refers  to  \"all  treatments  or\nprocedures  that  include  the  in  vitro  handling  of  both  human\noocytes and sperm or of embryos for the purpose of establishing a\npregnancy. This includes, but is not limited to, in vitro fertilization\nand  embryo  transfer,  gamete\nintrafallopian  transfer,  zygote\nintrafallopian transfer, tubal embryo transfer, gamete and embryo\ncryopreservation,  oocyte  and  embryo  donation,  and  gestational\nsurrogacy\" (Zegers-Hochschild 2009; Zegers-Hochschild 2017). The\nsuccess  of  assisted  reproduction  varies  depending  on  several\nfactors, such as maternal age (Marinakis 2011; Schmidt 2012; Yavas\n2017), maternal weight (Cai 2017; Kawwass 2016; Pinborg 2011), the\nnumber of embryos transferred (Martin 2017; McLernon 2010), the\nuse  of  gonadotrophins  (Maheshwari  2011;  Mochtar  2017;  Pouwer\n2015),  inadequate  endometrial  thickness  (Baradwan  2018;  Oron\n2018), uterine contractions (Chung 2017; Chung 2016), and others.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nA  thin  endometrium  (measured  at  <  8  mm  by  ultrasound  scan)\nhas  a  negative  impact  on  the  success  of  assisted  reproduction\n(Check  2011;  Eftekhar  2017);  live  births  are  possible  despite  thin\nendometria, but the pregnancy rate among these women is poor\n(Dix  2010;  Kasius  2014).  Investigators  have  expressed  a  marked\ninterest  in  studying  the  role  that  the  endometrium  plays  in  the\nsuccess of assisted reproduction (Casper 2011; Senturk 2008; Weiss\n2017).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nUterine  contractions  influence  embryo  implantation,  possibly\nthrough  mechanical  displacement  of  the  embryo.  Decreases\nin  pregnancy  rates  and  implantation  rates  were  noted  as  the\nfrequency  of  uterine  contractions  increased.  Approaches  aimed\nat  inhibiting  uterine  contractions  could  improve  pregnancy  rates\nfor assisted reproduction (Aguilar 2010; Bulletti 2006; Chung 2017;\nFanchin 2001; Fanchin 2009; Lesny 1998; Ng 2014).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDifferent  vasodilating  agents  have  been  proposed  to  thicken\nthe  endometrium  and  to  favour  uterine  relaxation.  Agents  used\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nin  assisted  reproduction  include  sildenafil,  glyceryl  trinitrate\n(GTN),  nifedipine,  amlodipine,  pentoxifylline,  and\nisosorbide\nmonohydrate  (Abdel  2017;  Aleyasin  2009;  Alieva  2012;  Azmy\n2016;  Das  2009;  Dehghani  Firouzabadi  2013;  El-Berry  2010;\nFahmy  2015;  Farzi  2005;  Kim  2010;  Magdi  Ammar  2017;  Mahran\n2016;  Mostafa  2003;  Ohl  2002;  Shaker  1993).  Sildenafil  (Viagra)\nis  a  phosphodiesterase-5-specific  inhibitor  that  increases  the\nvasodilatory effects of nitric oxide on vascular smooth muscle by\npreventing  the  degradation  of  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate\n(cGMP). Studies report that vaginally administered sildenafil could\nlead  to  improvement  in  uterine  blood  ﬂow  (Fetih  2017;  Sher\n2002;  Takasaki  2010;).  Nitric  oxide  donors  such  as  isosorbide\nmonohydrate and GTN are used in assisted reproduction. Glyceryl\ntrinitrate  is  also  used  medically  as  a  vasodilator;  in  2002  it  was\ndiscovered that these effects occur because GTN is converted inside\nthe body to nitric oxide by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase.\nGlyceryl  trinitrate,  which  is  available  in  the  form  of  tablets,\nsprays,  and  patches,  is  used  in  assisted  reproduction  in  an\neffort  to  improve  pregnancy  rates  (Chen  2005).  Acharya  2009\nand  Letur-Konirsch  2003  used  pentoxifylline  plus  vitamin  E  in\nwomen undergoing assisted reproduction. Reports have described\nsuccessful  conception  and  pregnancy  with  nifedipine  given  at\ndoses of 30 mg/d after secondary infertility (Wilson 1990).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nHow the intervention might work\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nEndometrial thickness varies with vascularity of the endometrium\nand  the  sub-endometrium,  regardless  of  the  concentration  of\noestradiol or progesterone (Raine-Fenning 2004). It is well known\nthat  some  vasodilators,  such  as  vaginal  sildenafil  citrate,  can\nproduce  selective  endometrial  vasodilation:  this  occurred  in  two\nwomen  with  Asherman's  syndrome  (a  condition  characterised\nby  the  presence  of  adhesions  or  fibrosis,  or  both,  within  the\nuterine  cavity).  \"These  women  achieved  pregnancy  in  the  first\ntreatment  cycle  with  vaginal  sildenafil  citrate\"  (Zinger  2006).\nVasodilators also increase radial artery flow, improving the quality\nof the endometrium in women with a thin endometrium (Takasaki\n2010).  It  has  been  observed  in  animal  studies  that  sildenafil\nplays  a  role  in  both  implantation  and  decidualisation  (cellular\nchanges  in  the  endometrium  in  preparation  for  implantation\nof  the  embryo  caused  by  the  effects  of  progesterone)  by\naffecting  β(3)  integrins  (which  are  cell  membrane  proteins)  and\nvascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  expression  during  the\nimplantation period (Biyiksiz 2011).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn addition, we know that markers of endometrial receptivity are\nreduced  during  stimulated  cycles  compared  with  natural  cycles\n(Chen  2008;  Evans  2012;  Revel  2012),  and  that  vasodilators  have\nan effect on amelioration of endometrial receptivity when used in\ncombination  with  an  ovarian  hyperstimulation  protocol  (Biyiksiz\n2011).  A  limited  number  of  studies  have  reported  enhanced\nendometrial development and increased implantation rates after\nadministration  of  vasodilators  (Sher  2002;  Takasaki  2010;  Zinger\n2006).  Glyceryl  trinitrate  at  very  low  doses  showed  a  significant\ninhibitory effect on human myometrium in vitro (Orth 2011; Wetzka\n2001).  Pentoxifylline  may  be  beneficial  in  reducing  hydrogen\nperoxide–induced  embryo  damage  and  improving  outcomes  of\nin  vitro  fertilisation  (Zhang  2004).  It  also  appears  to  improve\nthe  pregnancy  rate  among  patients  with  a  thin  endometrium\nwhen  combined  with  vitamin  E  (Acharya  2009;  Lédée-Bataille\n2002;  Letur-Könirsch  2002).

The rate of successful pregnancies brought to term has barely increased since the first assisted reproductive technology (ART) technique became available. Vasodilators have been proposed to increase endometrial receptivity, thicken the endometrium, and favour uterine relaxation, all of which could improve uterine receptivity and enhance the chances for successful assisted pregnancy.   To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vasodilators in women undergoing fertility treatment.   We  searched  the  following  electronic  databases,  trial  registers,  and  websites:  the  Cochrane  Gynaecology  and  Fertility  Group  (CGF) Specialised Register of controlled trials, the Cochrane Central Register of of Controlled Trials, via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO),  MEDLINE,  Embase,  PsycINFO,  the  Cumulative  Index  to  Nursing  and  Allied  Health  Literature  (CINAHL),  Web  of  Knowledge,  the Open System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenSIGLE), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of relevant articles. We conducted the search in October 2017 and applied no language restrictions.   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vasodilators alone or in combination with other treatments versus placebo or no treatment or versus other agents in women undergoing fertility treatment.   Four review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and calculated risk ratios (RRs). We combined study data using a fixed-effect model and assessed evidence quality using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methods. Our primary outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy and vasodilator side effects. Secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy, endometrial thickness, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy.   We included 15 studies with a total of 1326 women. All included studies compared a vasodilator versus placebo or no treatment. We judged most of these studies as having unclear risk of bias. Overall, the quality of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes. The main limitations were imprecision due to low numbers of events and participants and risk of bias due to unclear methods of randomisation.   Vasodilators probably make little or no difference in rates of live birth compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.69; three RCTs; N = 350; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence) but probably increase overall rates of side effects including headache and tachycardia (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.66; four RCTs; N = 418; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). Evidence suggests that if 236 per 1000 women achieve live birth with placebo or no treatment, then between 196 and 398 per 1000 will do so with the use of vasodilators.   Compared with placebo or no treatment, vasodilators may slightly improve clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.77; 11 RCTs; N = 1054; I2 = 6%; low-quality evidence). Vasodilators probably make little or no difference in rates of multiple gestation (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.42; three RCTs; N = 370; I2 = 0%; low-quality evidence), miscarriage (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.86; three RCTs; N = 350; I2 = 0%; low- quality evidence), or ectopic pregnancy (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.69; two RCTs; N = 250; I2 = 5%; low-quality evidence). All studies found benefit for endometrial thickening, but reported effects varied (I2 = 92%) and ranged from a mean difference of 0.80 higher (95% CI 0.18 to 1.42) to 3.57 higher (95% CI 3.01 to 4.13) with very low-quality evidence, so we are uncertain how to interpret these results.   Evidence was insufficient to show whether vasodilators increase the live birth rate in women undergoing fertility treatment. However, low-quality  evidence  suggests  that  vasodilators  may  slightly  increase  clinical  pregnancy  rates.  Moderate-quality  evidence  shows  that vasodilators increase overall side effects in comparison with placebo or no treatment. Adequately powered studies are needed so that each treatment can be evaluated more accurately.   P L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y   Researchers  at  Cochrane  reviewed  available  evidence  on  the  effects  of  vasodilators  (drugs  used  to  widen  blood  vessels)  in  women undergoing fertility treatment.   For women undergoing fertility treatment for different causes, interventions aimed at improving the receptivity of the uterus are of utmost importance.  Many  different  drugs  have  been  evaluated,  with  the  aim  of  increasing  rates  of  implantation  and  live  birth.  These  include vasodilating  agents,  which  are  used  to  dilate  blood  vessels  to  improve  endometrial  receptivity,  thicken  the  endometrium,  and  favour uterine relaxation, among other effects.   We found 15 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which people are randomly allocated to one or more treatment groups) that compared the use of vasodilators versus placebo or no treatment in a total of 1326 women undergoing fertility treatment. The evidence is current to October 2017.   Only three of the included studies reported live birth rates. Overall, vasodilators probably make little or no difference in rates of live birth. Moderate-quality evidence shows that vasodilators probably increase overall rates of side effects (including headache and tachycardia (faster than normal heartbeat)) in comparison with placebo or no treatment. However, low-quality evidence suggests that vasodilators may increase the chance of becoming pregnant.   The evidence is of low to moderate quality. More research is needed (one study is ongoing and will be incorporated into this review in a subsequent update).

Between 0.2% and 4.7% of babies born in developed countries are conceived through techniques of assisted reproductive technology (ART)  (Bouillon  2013;  Sunderam  2012;  Sunderam  2017).  A  total of  1,144,858  babies  were  reported  to  have  been  born  worldwide in  2008,  2009,  and  2010  (Dyer  2016).  Worldwide,  ART  practices are  characterised  by  outcome  differences  between  regions.  By 2012-2013,  fresh  cycle  live  birth  rates  were  highest  in  the  United States  (29%)  and  lowest  in  Japan  (5%)  (Kushnir  2017).  In  the  17 European  countries  that  report  the  number  of  ART  procedures, practitioners  performed  374,177  ART  cycles  in  a  population  of 310  million  (1175  cycles  per  million).  In  these  countries,  the clinical pregnancy rates for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) per aspiration and  per  transfer  were  29.6%  and  34.5%,  respectively.  Those  for intracytoplasmic  sperm  injection  (ICSI)  were  27.8%  and  32.9% (European IVF-Monitoring Consortium (EIM) 2017). Statistics have been very similar in recent years (de Mouzon 2012; ESHIRE 2016; Ferraretti 2012; Ferraretti 2013; Sullivan 2013).   According  to  the  World  Health  Organization,  medically  assisted reproduction  is  defined  as  reproduction  brought  about  through ovulation  induction,  controlled  ovarian  stimulation,  ovulation triggering,  insemination,  and  ART  techniques  (Zegers-Hochschild 2009;  Zegers-Hochschild  2017).  ART  refers  to  \"all  treatments  or procedures  that  include  the  in  vitro  handling  of  both  human oocytes and sperm or of embryos for the purpose of establishing a pregnancy. This includes, but is not limited to, in vitro fertilization and  embryo  transfer,  gamete intrafallopian  transfer,  zygote intrafallopian transfer, tubal embryo transfer, gamete and embryo cryopreservation,  oocyte  and  embryo  donation,  and  gestational surrogacy\" (Zegers-Hochschild 2009; Zegers-Hochschild 2017). The success  of  assisted  reproduction  varies  depending  on  several factors, such as maternal age (Marinakis 2011; Schmidt 2012; Yavas 2017), maternal weight (Cai 2017; Kawwass 2016; Pinborg 2011), the number of embryos transferred (Martin 2017; McLernon 2010), the use  of  gonadotrophins  (Maheshwari  2011;  Mochtar  2017;  Pouwer 2015),  inadequate  endometrial  thickness  (Baradwan  2018;  Oron 2018), uterine contractions (Chung 2017; Chung 2016), and others.   A  thin  endometrium  (measured  at  <  8  mm  by  ultrasound  scan) has  a  negative  impact  on  the  success  of  assisted  reproduction (Check  2011;  Eftekhar  2017);  live  births  are  possible  despite  thin endometria, but the pregnancy rate among these women is poor (Dix  2010;  Kasius  2014).  Investigators  have  expressed  a  marked interest  in  studying  the  role  that  the  endometrium  plays  in  the success of assisted reproduction (Casper 2011; Senturk 2008; Weiss 2017).   Uterine  contractions  influence  embryo  implantation,  possibly through  mechanical  displacement  of  the  embryo.  Decreases in  pregnancy  rates  and  implantation  rates  were  noted  as  the frequency  of  uterine  contractions  increased.  Approaches  aimed at  inhibiting  uterine  contractions  could  improve  pregnancy  rates for assisted reproduction (Aguilar 2010; Bulletti 2006; Chung 2017; Fanchin 2001; Fanchin 2009; Lesny 1998; Ng 2014).   Different  vasodilating  agents  have  been  proposed  to  thicken the  endometrium  and  to  favour  uterine  relaxation.  Agents  used   in  assisted  reproduction  include  sildenafil,  glyceryl  trinitrate (GTN),  nifedipine,  amlodipine,  pentoxifylline,  and isosorbide monohydrate  (Abdel  2017;  Aleyasin  2009;  Alieva  2012;  Azmy 2016;  Das  2009;  Dehghani  Firouzabadi  2013;  El-Berry  2010; Fahmy  2015;  Farzi  2005;  Kim  2010;  Magdi  Ammar  2017;  Mahran 2016;  Mostafa  2003;  Ohl  2002;  Shaker  1993).  Sildenafil  (Viagra) is  a  phosphodiesterase-5-specific  inhibitor  that  increases  the vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide on vascular smooth muscle by preventing  the  degradation  of  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate (cGMP). Studies report that vaginally administered sildenafil could lead  to  improvement  in  uterine  blood  ﬂow  (Fetih  2017;  Sher 2002;  Takasaki  2010;).  Nitric  oxide  donors  such  as  isosorbide monohydrate and GTN are used in assisted reproduction. Glyceryl trinitrate  is  also  used  medically  as  a  vasodilator;  in  2002  it  was discovered that these effects occur because GTN is converted inside the body to nitric oxide by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. Glyceryl  trinitrate,  which  is  available  in  the  form  of  tablets, sprays,  and  patches,  is  used  in  assisted  reproduction  in  an effort  to  improve  pregnancy  rates  (Chen  2005).  Acharya  2009 and  Letur-Konirsch  2003  used  pentoxifylline  plus  vitamin  E  in women undergoing assisted reproduction. Reports have described successful  conception  and  pregnancy  with  nifedipine  given  at doses of 30 mg/d after secondary infertility (Wilson 1990).   How the intervention might work   Endometrial thickness varies with vascularity of the endometrium and  the  sub-endometrium,  regardless  of  the  concentration  of oestradiol or progesterone (Raine-Fenning 2004). It is well known that  some  vasodilators,  such  as  vaginal  sildenafil  citrate,  can produce  selective  endometrial  vasodilation:  this  occurred  in  two women  with  Asherman's  syndrome  (a  condition  characterised by  the  presence  of  adhesions  or  fibrosis,  or  both,  within  the uterine  cavity).  \"These  women  achieved  pregnancy  in  the  first treatment  cycle  with  vaginal  sildenafil  citrate\"  (Zinger  2006). Vasodilators also increase radial artery flow, improving the quality of the endometrium in women with a thin endometrium (Takasaki 2010).  It  has  been  observed  in  animal  studies  that  sildenafil plays  a  role  in  both  implantation  and  decidualisation  (cellular changes  in  the  endometrium  in  preparation  for  implantation of  the  embryo  caused  by  the  effects  of  progesterone)  by affecting  β(3)  integrins  (which  are  cell  membrane  proteins)  and vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  expression  during  the implantation period (Biyiksiz 2011).   In addition, we know that markers of endometrial receptivity are reduced  during  stimulated  cycles  compared  with  natural  cycles (Chen  2008;  Evans  2012;  Revel  2012),  and  that  vasodilators  have an effect on amelioration of endometrial receptivity when used in combination  with  an  ovarian  hyperstimulation  protocol  (Biyiksiz 2011).  A  limited  number  of  studies  have  reported  enhanced endometrial development and increased implantation rates after administration  of  vasodilators  (Sher  2002;  Takasaki  2010;  Zinger 2006).  Glyceryl  trinitrate  at  very  low  doses  showed  a  significant inhibitory effect on human myometrium in vitro (Orth 2011; Wetzka 2001).  Pentoxifylline  may  be  beneficial  in  reducing  hydrogen peroxide–induced  embryo  damage  and  improving  outcomes  of in  vitro  fertilisation  (Zhang  2004).  It  also  appears  to  improve the  pregnancy  rate  among  patients  with  a  thin  endometrium when  combined  with  vitamin  E  (Acharya  2009;  Lédée-Bataille 2002;  Letur-Könirsch  2002).  Nimodipine,  which  is  a  vasodilator calcium  channel  blocker,  may  prevent  or  delay  the  luteinising   hormone  (LH)  surge  during  controlled  ovarian  stimulation  cycles when clomiphene citrate is used in sub-fertile patients undergoing assisted reproduction by intrauterine insemination (Penzias 2012).   Several  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  have  studied  the efficacy of different treatments (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  agonist,  progesterone,  aspirin,  steroids,  human  chorionic gonadotrophin  (hCG),  vitamin  E,  cytokines,  and  vasodilators) in  endometrial  preparation  for  women  undergoing  assisted reproduction  (Aleyasin  2009;  Eftekhar  2017;  Gelbaya  2005; Glujovsky  2010;  Kim  2010;  Lensen  2016;  Ohl  2002;  Shaker 1993;  Torres  2005).  However,  evidence  is  insufficient  to  allow investigators  to  endorse  a  particular  protocol  for  endometrial preparation.   Researchers have only partially studied the effects of vasodilators on  endometrial  preparation  in  fertility  treatment.  Their  role  in implantation, decidualisation, and uterine relaxation, among other events,  has  not  been  evaluated.  A  previous  systematic  review assessed  different  treatments  for  endometrial  preparation  for embryo  transfer  but  excluded  the  comparison  of  vasodilators versus other treatments (Glujovsky 2010). Instead, the effectiveness of these treatments remains unproven, and this could potentially increase  incrementally  costs  or  side  effects  involved  in  assisted reproduction. Studies are needed to identify and assess the efficacy and  safety  of  vasodilators  used  with  or  without  other  agents,  or compared  with  placebo  or  other  agents,  in  women  undergoing fertility treatment.   To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vasodilators in women undergoing fertility treatment.   • We excluded cross-over trials, as the design is not valid in this   context.   We considered women undergoing fertility treatment, regardless of the thickness of the endometrium. We applied no restrictions on age or comorbidities.   For the purposes of this review, fertility treatment means medically assisted  reproduction,  such  as  ovulation  induction;  controlled ovarian  stimulation;  ovulation  triggering;  assisted  reproductive technology  procedures;  and intracervical,  and intravaginal insemination with the semen of husband, partner, or donor (Zegers-Hochschild 2009; Zegers-Hochschild 2017).   intrauterine,   We  planned  to  include  vasodilators  (nifedipine,  nimodipine, pentoxifylline,  nitric  oxide  donors  such  as  GTN  and  isosorbide mononitrate,  and  sildenafil,  among  others)  administered  via  any route,  with  or  without  other  agents  (oestrogen  or  tocopherol   vitamin  E)  compared  with  placebo  or  no  treatment  or  any  other active intervention (progesterone, oestrogen, or other).   Types of outcome measures   Primary outcomes   1. Live birth or ongoing pregnancy 2.

Other adverse events: multiple gestation or birth, spontaneous   miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy   Terms were defined as follows.   1. Live birth: the complete expulsion or extraction from a woman of a product of fertilisation after 22 completed weeks' gestation, which,  after  such  separation,  breathes  or  shows  any  other evidence  of  life,  such  as  heartbeat,  umbilical  cord  pulsation, or  definitive  movement  of  voluntary  muscles,  irrespective  of whether  the  umbilical  cord  has  been  cut  or  the  placenta  is attached.  A  birth  weight  of  500  grams  or  more  can  be  used  if gestational age is unknown. 'Live birth' refers to the individual newborn, for example, a twin delivery represents two live births (Zegers-Hochschild 2017). a. Ongoing pregnancy is defined as evidence of a gestational sac  with  foetal  heart  motion  at  12  weeks,  confirmed  by ultrasound.   pregnancy   pregnancy:   by ultrasonographic  visualisation  of  one  or  more  gestational sacs  or  definitive  clinical  signs  of  pregnancy.  In  addition  to intrauterine  pregnancy,  this  includes  a  clinically  documented ectopic pregnancy (Zegers-Hochschild 2017).   diagnosed   3. Thickened  endometrium:  an  endometrium  that  measures  8   mm or greater, as determined by ultrasound scan.   4. Multiple  gestation  or  birth:  a  pregnancy  that  involves  more   than one embryo or fetus (Zegers-Hochschild 2017).   5. Spontaneous abortion or miscarriage: the spontaneous loss of an intrauterine pregnancy before 22 completed weeks' gestation (Zegers-Hochschild 2017).   6. Ectopic  pregnancy:  a  pregnancy  outside   the  uterine cavity  diagnosed  by  ultrasound,  surgical  visualisation,  or histopathology (Zegers-Hochschild 2017).

We  performed  the  pertinent  statistical  analysis  in  accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by Cochrane. Review authors (RG or DG and MJM or AV) independently examined titles and abstracts retrieved through the search and determined whether  studies  met  review  inclusion  criteria.  For  studies  with potential  or  unclear  eligibility,  we  obtained  the  full  text  of  the article for independent assessment. If needed, we contacted study investigators to clarify study eligibility. We resolved disagreements by  discussion  and  consensus  with  a  third  review  author  (DG  or XB). We documented the selection process in a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses)  flow chart (Figure 1).   Figure 1.   Flow of information through different phases of the systematic review.   Review authors (RG or FR and MJM or AV) independently extracted data  from  eligible  studies  using  a  data  extraction  form  designed and pilot-tested by the review authors. We resolved disagreements by  discussion  and  consensus  with  a  third  review  author  (DG  or XB).  Data  extracted  included  study  characteristics,  methods,  and outcome  data.  When  a  study  had  multiple  publications,  we  used the main trial report for reference purposes and derived additional details  from  secondary  papers.  We  contacted  the  original  study authors  if  we  needed  further  information.  For  multi-arm  studies, we  excluded  data  from  arms  that  did  not  meet  review  eligibility criteria.   Review authors (RG or FR and MJM or AV) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' assessment  tool  (Higgins  2011).  We  assessed  allocation  (random   sequence  generation  and  allocation  concealment),  blinding  of participants  and  personnel,  incomplete  outcome  data,  selective reporting,  and  other  biases.  We  resolved  disagreements  by discussion  and  consensus  with  a  third  review  author.  We  fully described  all  judgements  and  presented  conclusions  in  the  'Risk of bias' table (Figure 2; Figure 3), which we incorporated into our interpretation of review findings by performing sensitivity analyses (see below).   We  assessed  whether  evidence  suggested  within-trial  selective reporting, including  failure  to  report  obvious  outcomes  or insufficient  reporting  of  outcomes.  We  searched  published protocols to compare outcomes versus those of the corresponding published  studies.  When  a  study  failed  to  report  live  births  but did  report  interim  outcomes  such  as  pregnancy,  we  undertook an informal assessment to determine whether interim values (e.g. clinical pregnancy) were similar to those reported in studies that also reported live births.   Figure 2.   Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.   Figure 3.   Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.   Assessment of reporting biases   For  dichotomous  data  (e.g.  live  births),  we  calculated  risk  ratios (RRs)  using  the  numbers  of  events  in  control  and  intervention groups of each study. We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for  all  outcomes.  When  data  were  not  available  to  calculate  RRs, we  used  the  most  detailed  available  numerical  data  that  could be used to complete similar analyses (e.g. test statistics, P value). We  compared  the  magnitude  and  direction  of  effect  reported  by studies against the way in which they are presented in the review, while taking account of legitimate differences. For continuous data, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI.   We conducted all analyses per woman randomly assigned. When data  did  not  allow  valid  analyses  (e.g.  \"per  cycle\"  data),  we contacted study authors to request \"per woman\" data. If available data  could  not  be  analysed,  we  planned  to  summarise  the  data briefly  in  an  additional  table  without  meta-analysis.  We  counted multiple live births (e.g. twins, triplets) as a single live birth event.   We  analysed  data  on  an  intention-to-treat  basis.  We  attempted to  obtain  missing  data  from  the  original  researchers.  We  asked trial authors via email or telephone to provide further details. We planned to impute individual values for missing data for any of the primary outcomes, but no study with data for primary outcomes presented important attrition bias.   clinical   determined  whether   and  methodological We characteristics  of  included  studies  were  sufficiently  similar  for meta-analysis  to  provide  a  clinically  meaningful  summary.  We assessed  statistical  heterogeneity  by  using  the  I2  statistical measure.  We  considered  an  I2  value  greater  than  50%  to show evidence of substantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2003). When we  detected  substantial  heterogeneity,  we  explored  possible explanations  via  corresponding  analyses.  We  took  statistical heterogeneity into account when interpreting the results.   If  all  eligible  studies  were  not  retrieved,  the  review  may  be biased.  The  review  authors  have  tried  to  minimise  the  potential impact  of  publication  and  other  reporting  biases  by  ensuring  a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by remaining alert to data duplication. If more studies had been included in an analysis, we would have used a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small- study  effects  (i.e.  the  tendency  for  estimates  of  the  intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller studies).   Data synthesis   When  we  judged  studies  to  be  sufficiently  similar,  we  combined data using a fixed-effect model for the following comparisons.   1. Vasodilator (with or without an additional intervention) versus   placebo or no treatment. a. Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). b. Isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN or IMN). c. Sildenafil. d. Amlodipine. e. Tadalafil. f. Pentoxifylline (PTX) and vitamin E. g. Sildenafil and oestradiol.   2. Vasodilator (with or without an additional intervention) versus   active intervention. a. Stratified by type of vasodilator.   Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity   If  data  had  been  available,  we  would  have  conducted  subgroup analyses  to  examine  separate  evidence  within  the  following subgroups.   1. Studies in women with thin endometrium (< 8 mm) undergoing   fertility treatment.   in  women  with  normal  endometrial   thickness   undergoing fertility treatment.   3. Studies including different routes of administration. 4. Studies with and without co-interventions.   We also performed a post hoc subgroup analysis to evaluate studies that  used  only  vasodilators  versus  no  co-intervention  (vitamin  E, oestrogen).   We  conducted  sensitivity  analyses  for  the  primary  outcomes  to determine whether conclusions were robust enough to withstand arbitrary  decisions  regarding  eligibility  and  analysis  of  included studies.   These  analyses  required  consideration  of  whether  the  review conclusions  would  have  differed  if  we  had  adopted  a  random- effects model.   Overall quality of the body of evidence - 'Summary of findings' table   We  prepared  a  'Summary  of  findings'  table  using  GRADEpro  and Cochrane methods (GRADEpro GDT 2014; Higgins 2011). This table presents  overall  quality  of  the  body  of  evidence  for  the  review outcomes live birth or ongoing pregnancy, vasodilator side effects, clinical  pregnancy,  thickened  endometrium,  multiple  gestation, spontaneous  miscarriage,  and  ectopic  pregnancy  for  the  main review  comparison  (vasodilator  vs  placebo  or  no  treatment).  We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria: risk of bias, consistency  of  effect,  imprecision,  indirectness,  and  publication bias.  Two  review  authors  (MJM  and  AV)  working  independently judged  evidence  quality  (high,  moderate,  low,  or  very  low)  and resolved disagreements by discussion. We justified, documented, and  incorporated  judgements  into  reporting  of  results  for  each outcome.   Through  the  search,  we  retrieved  779  articles.  A  total  of  29 studies were potentially eligible, and we retrieved those full texts. Fifteen  studies  met  the  inclusion  criteria  of  this  review  (Abdel 2017; Aleyasin 2009; Alieva 2012; Azmy 2016; Das 2009; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; El-Berry 2010; Fahmy 2015; Farzi 2005; Kim 2010; Magdi Ammar 2017; Mahran 2016; Mostafa 2003; Ohl 2002; Shaker 1993). We excluded 11 studies (Alborzi 2007; Ataalla 2016; Balasch 1997;  Check  2004;  Creus  2008;  Kamencic  2008;  Malinova  2013; Raine-Fenning 2009; Rosen 1987; Sher 2000; Shin 2002); two studies are  awaiting  classification  (Casper  2013;  Penzias  2012);  and  one study is ongoing (NCT02072291).   For  further  information,  see  the  following  tables:  Characteristics included  studies;  Characteristics  of  excluded  studies; of Characteristics and Characteristics of ongoing studies.   classification;   awaiting   studies   See Figure 1 (PRISMA study screening and selection flow chart) for details of this process.   We included in this review 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with  a  parallel  design  (Abdel  2017;  Aleyasin  2009;  Alieva  2012; Azmy  2016;  Das  2009;  Dehghani  Firouzabadi  2013;  El-Berry  2010;   Fahmy  2015;  Farzi  2005;  Kim  2010;  Magdi  Ammar  2017;  Mahran 2016; Mostafa 2003; Ohl 2002; Shaker 1993). Publication dates for the included studies ranged from 1993 to 2017. Most studies were conducted at hospital clinics for infertility.   We included in this review 15 studies with a total of 1326 women.   The  studies  included  690  women  in  the  intervention  groups  and 636 in the control groups. Mean participant age was 31.50 (± 4.92) years.  Four  trials  included  women  with  a  'poor  prognosis'  (i.e. infertile  women  with  a  thin  endometrium  or  an  antecedent  of poor  endometrial  response,  or  with  a  history  of  two  or  more previous  implantation  failures)  (Das  2009;  Dehghani  Firouzabadi 2013;  Kim  2010;  Ohl  2002).  Eleven  trials  included  women  with  a 'good prognosis' (i.e. women without a previous history of failure of zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or in vitro fertilisation (IVF), or  women  with  unexplained  infertility,  or  women  with  infertility and  with  regular  menstrual  cycles,  or  women  who  had  received a diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome) (Abdel 2017; Aleyasin 2009;  Alieva  2012;  Azmy  2016;  El-Berry  2010;  Fahmy  2015;  Farzi 2005;  Magdi  Ammar  2017;  Mahran  2016;  Mostafa  2003;  Shaker 1993). Eight of the 15 studies were performed in women undergoing ART (Aleyasin 2009; Alieva 2012; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; Farzi 2005;  Kim  2010;  Mostafa  2003;  Ohl  2002;  Shaker  1993),  one  was performed in women undergoing artificial insemination (Das 2009), and  six  involved  ovulation  induction  (Abdel  2017;  Azmy  2016;  El- Berry 2010; Fahmy 2015; Magdi Ammar 2017; Mahran 2016).   Vasodilators used in these studies included pentoxifylline 400 mg twice  daily  +  tocopherol  vitamin  E  400  mg  twice  daily  2  cycles before starting ZIFT cycle until the β-hCG became positive or the cycle was cancelled (Aleyasin 2009); nitric oxide donors (isosorbide mononitrate  (ISMN))  20  mg  vaginally  until  diagnosis  of  ovulation and pregnancy (El-Berry 2010); isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) 10 mg vaginal tablets from cycle day 5 to 9 (Abdel 2017); 10 mg isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) tablets applied vaginally from day 2 to day 15 of  the  cycle  or  20  mg  ISMN  tablets  applied  vaginally  from  day  2 to day 15 of the cycle (Mahran 2016); glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) 0.4 mg  oral  dose  15  minutes  before  fresh  ET  (Farzi  2005);  sildenafil citrate  tablets  (50  mg)  daily  (from  first  day  of  cycle  until  day progesterone was started) (Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013); sildenafil 25 mg vaginally 4 times a day from day 5 of cycle until day of hCG administration (Das 2009); sildenafil citrate 25 mg orally 3 times/d from seventh to 11th day of cycle (Fahmy 2015); amlodipine (Azmy 2016); tadalafil oral 5 mg/d for 7 days (from fourth day until 10th day of the cycle) (Magdi Ammar 2017); vaginal sildenafil 25 mg/d + oral oestradiol valerate 4 mg/d from day of embryo transfer until pregnancy test (11 days) (Kim 2010); 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patch applied once daily, beginning the morning of the day before transfer, just after transvaginal ultrasonography and colour doppler were  performed  (Ohl  2002);  2  sublingual  spray  emissions  of  GTN 400 μg/spray (Shaker 1993); sildenafil citrate in the IVF cycle (Alieva 2012);  and  glyceryl  trinitrate  skin  patches  5  mg  daily  for  2  weeks (Mostafa 2003).   1. Thirteen  of  15  studies  compared  vasodilator  alone  versus placebo or no treatment (Abdel 2017; Alieva 2012; Azmy 2016; Das  2009;  Dehghani  Firouzabadi  2013;  El-Berry  2010;  Fahmy 2015;  Farzi  2005;  Magdi  Ammar  2017;  Mahran  2016;  Mostafa 2003; Ohl 2002; Shaker 1993).   2. Two  of  15  studies  compared  vasodilator  plus  another  agent   versus placebo or no treatment (Aleyasin 2009; Kim 2010).   1. Three  of  15  studies  reported  live  births  (Aleyasin  2009;  Farzi   2. Four  of  15  studies  reported  side  effects  (Fahmy  2015;  Mahran   Five studies had low risk of bias related to allocation concealment (Abdel 2017; Aleyasin 2009; Fahmy 2015; Mahran 2016; Ohl 2002). The other 10 studies did not describe the method used to conceal the sequence, and we ranked them as having unclear risk of bias (Alieva 2012; Azmy 2016; Das 2009; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; El- Berry 2010; Farzi 2005; Kim 2010; Magdi Ammar 2017; Mostafa 2003; Shaker 1993).   3. Eight of 15 studies reported clinical pregnancy (Aleyasin 2009; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; Fahmy 2015; Farzi 2005; Kim 2010; Magdi  Ammar  2017;  Mostafa  2003;  Ohl  2002).  However,  four studies reported biochemical pregnancy (Abdel 2017; Das 2009; El-Berry 2010; Mahran 2016), and three studies did not report the method used to diagnose pregnancy (Alieva 2012; Azmy 2016; Shaker 1993). We did not include in analyses studies reporting biochemical pregnancy.   4. Four of 15 studies reported other adverse events (Aleyasin 2009; Alieva 2012; Farzi 2005; Ohl 2002). In one study, reproductive loss in the control group looks unusually high (20%), but the adverse event was not defined (Alieva 2012).   No  study  provided  data  on  the  number  of  participants  with thickened  endometrium.  Only  two  studies  mentioned  that  all women  had  a  thin  endometrium  before  treatment  (Das  2009; Kim  2010).  However,  five  studies  reported  a  mean  difference  in thickened endometrium (Abdel 2017; Azmy 2016; Das 2009; Magdi Ammar 2017; Mahran 2016).   We excluded 11 studies from the review for the following reasons.   1. Five  of  11  studies  were  not  parallel  RCTs  (Ataalla  2016;  Check   2. Four of 11 studies did not include participants of interest for this review (Alborzi 2007; Balasch 1997; Creus 2008; Kamencic 2008). 3. One of 11 studies did not include comparisons of interest for this   review (Rosen 1987).   4. One of 11 studies did not include outcomes of interest for this   review (Malinova 2013).   In  addition,  two  studies  are  awaiting  classification  (Casper  2013; Penzias 2012), and one study is ongoing (NCT02072291).   In  Figure  2  and  Figure  3,  we  have  shown  and  summarised  the judgements of review authors regarding each risk of bias item for each included study.   Five  studies  had  low  risk  of  selection  bias  related  to  sequence generation (Abdel 2017; Aleyasin 2009; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; Magdi Ammar 2017; Ohl 2002). The other 10 studies did not describe the  method  of  randomisation,  and  we  ranked  them  as  having unclear  risk  of  bias  (Alieva  2012;  Azmy  2016;  Das  2009;  El-Berry 2010;  Fahmy  2015;  Farzi  2005;  Kim  2010;  Mahran  2016;  Mostafa 2003; Shaker 1993).   Five  of  15  studies  had  low  risk  of  performance  bias  (Abdel  2017; Aleyasin  2009;  Farzi  2005;  Ohl  2002;  Shaker  1993).  Four  of  these were double-blind and used placebo as a control (Abdel 2017; Farzi 2005; Ohl 2002; Shaker 1993), and one was single-blind (surgeons who conducted the operations were blinded) (Aleyasin 2009). Three studies did not provide a description of blinding (Alieva 2012; Magdi Ammar 2017; Mostafa 2003).   Eight  of  15  studies  had  low  risk  of  detection  bias  (Abdel  2017; Aleyasin 2009; Das 2009; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; El-Berry 2010; Farzi  2005;  Kim  2010;  Ohl  2002).  Seven  of  15  studies  did  not mention  blinding,  and  we  judged  them  as  having  unclear  risk  of detection bias (Alieva 2012; Azmy 2016; Fahmy 2015; Magdi Ammar 2017; Mahran 2016; Mostafa 2003; Shaker 1993). Blinding was not considered as likely to influence the outcome of live birth or clinical pregnancy. The same was not true for adverse events, for which lack of blinding could potentially affect findings.   Incomplete outcome data   Nine  of  15  studies  analysed  all  or  most  (>  95%)  of  the  women randomly assigned and had low risk of attrition bias (Abdel 2017; Aleyasin 2009; Das 2009; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; Fahmy 2015; Farzi 2005; Kim 2010; Ohl 2002; Shaker 1993). Only one study used the  number  of  cycles  instead  of  the  number  of  participants  in analysis (El-Berry 2010), and four studies did not describe attrition (Alieva 2012; Azmy 2016; Mahran 2016; Mostafa 2003). These studies had unclear risk of attrition bias. One of 15 studies was at high risk of attrition bias (Magdi Ammar 2017).   Selective reporting   Ten of 15 studies reported outcomes that were clearly prespecified in the methods section, and we classified them as having low risk of selective reporting bias (Abdel 2017; Aleyasin 2009; Azmy 2016; Dehghani  Firouzabadi  2013;  Fahmy  2015;  Farzi  2005;  Kim  2010; Magdi Ammar 2017; Ohl 2002; Shaker 1993). Four of these studies reported  primary  outcomes  (Aleyasin  2009;  Farzi  2005;  Ohl  2002; Shaker 1993): three studies reported live birth (Aleyasin 2009; Farzi 2005;  Ohl  2002),  and  four  reported  adverse  effects  (Fahmy  2015; Mahran 2016; Ohl 2002; Shaker 1993). However, the protocol was available for only one study (Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013).   Other potential sources of bias   Twelve  of  15  studies  reported  baseline  balance  between  groups in  terms  of  age  and  duration  of  infertility  (Abdel  2017;  Aleyasin 2009; Das 2009; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; El-Berry 2010; Fahmy 2015; Farzi 2005; Kim 2010; Magdi Ammar 2017; Mahran 2016; Ohl 2002;  Shaker  1993).  In  addition,  four  studies  reported  baseline comparability regarding type of infertility, cause of infertility, and body  mass  index.  We  classified  these  studies  as  having  low  risk of bias. We identified no other potential sources of bias. However,   three studies did not report baseline features, and we judged them to  have  unclear  risk  of  detection  bias  (Alieva  2012;  Azmy  2016; Mostafa 2003).   See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Vasodilator compared  to  placebo  or  no  treatment  for  women  undergoing fertility treatment   1. Vasodilator (with or without an additional intervention) versus placebo or no treatment   Primary outcomes   Figure 4.   Forest plot of comparison: 1 Vasodilator vs placebo or no treatment, outcome: 1.1 Live birth.   1. Comparison  of  glyceryl  trinitrate  (GTN)  versus  placebo  (Farzi   treatment (Aleyasin 2009).   Vasodilators  (given  alone  or  with  another  agent)  probably  make little or no difference in rates of \"live birth or ongoing pregnancy\" compared  with  placebo  or  no  treatment  (RR  1.18,  95%  CI 0.83  to  1.69;  three  RCTs;  N  =  350;  I2  =  0%;  moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 1.1; Figure 4; Summary of findings for the main comparison). Limiting the analysis to studies of vasodilators given without  a  co-intervention  did  not  substantially  change  the  main   finding  (RR  1.09,  95%  CI  0.69  to  1.72;  two  RCTs;  N  =  238;  I2  =  0%; moderate-quality evidence).   We  stratified  the  analysis  by  type  of  vasodilator.  The  test  for subgroup  differences  shows  no  evidence  of  differences  between subgroups for this outcome (Chi2 = 0.33, df = 1 (P = 0.56), I2 = 0%).   Sensitivity  analyses  based  on  a  random-effects  model  did  not change the evidence (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.69; three RCTs; N = 350; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence).   Figure 5.   Forest plot of comparison: 1 Vasodilator vs placebo or no treatment, outcome: 1.2 Vasodilator side effects.   Four  studies  reported  the  number  of  vasodilator  side  effects  by group. Two assessed glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) versus placebo (Ohl 2002;  Shaker  1993),  one  sildenafil  versus  placebo  (Fahmy  2015), and  another  isosorbide  mononitrate  (ISMN)  versus  no  treatment (Mahran 2016).   The  vasodilator  group  most  commonly  reported  the  following adverse  events (AEs):  hypotension,  headache,  tachycardia, dizziness, hot flushes, nervousness, insomnia, constipation, and a feeling of weakness.   Vasodilators (alone or with another agent) probably increase side effects  compared  with  placebo  or  no  treatment  (RR  2.35,  95%  CI 1.51 to 3.66; four RCTs; N = 418; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence).   We  stratified  the  analysis  by  type  of  vasodilator.  The  test  for subgroup  differences  shows  no  evidence  of  differences  between subgroups for this outcome (Chi2 = 1.12, df = 2 (P = 0.57), I2 = 0%).   Two  studies  reported  specific  vasodilator  side  effects.  One compared  sildenafil  versus  placebo  (Fahmy  2015),  and  another isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) versus no treatment (Mahran 2016). Vasodilators may increase headache (RR 4.12, 95% CI 1.87 to 9.06; two RCTs; N = 160; I2 = 7%; low-quality evidence) and tachycardia (RR  3.83,  95%  CI  1.25  to  11.75;  one  RCT;  N  =  90;  low-quality evidence). Evidence was insufficient to show whether groups had differences in hypotension (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.14; one RCT; N = 90; low-quality evidence), dizziness (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.26; one RCT; N = 90; low-quality evidence), or hot flushes (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.96 to 5.99; two RCTs; N = 160; I2 = 7%; low-quality evidence).   Secondary outcomes   Figure 6.   Forest plot of comparison: 1 Vasodilator vs placebo or no treatment, outcome: 1.4 Clinical pregnancy.   Fifteen studies reported clinical pregnancy. However, four studies reported biochemical pregnancy, and we did not include them in the analysis (Das 2009; El-Berry 2010; Fahmy 2015; Mahran 2016). Two studies did not report the method used to diagnose pregnancy (Alieva 2012; Shaker 1993). We included them in the analyses and noted this limitation in the footnotes. We analysed 11 studies (Abdel 2017; Aleyasin 2009; Alieva 2012; Azmy 2016; Dehghani Firouzabadi 2013; Farzi 2005; Kim 2010; Magdi Ammar 2017; Mostafa 2003; Ohl 2002; Shaker 1993).   1. Farzi  2005,Mostafa  2003,Ohl  2002,  and  Shaker  1993  compared   glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) versus placebo or no treatment.   versus no treatment or placebo.   3. Kim  2010  compared  sildenafil  plus  oestrogen  versus  no   treatment.   4. Aleyasin  2009  compared  pentoxifylline  (PTX)  +  tocopherol   vitamin E versus no treatment.   5. Abdel  2017  compared  isosorbide  mononitrate  (IMN  or  ISMN)   versus placebo or no treatment.   6. Azmy 2016 compared amlodipine versus placebo. 7. Magdi Ammar 2017 compared tadalafil versus placebo.   Vasodilators  (alone  or  with  another  agent)  may  slightly  improve clinical  pregnancy  compared  with  placebo  or  no  treatment  (RR 1.45,  95%  CI  1.19  to  1.77;  11  RCTs;  N  =  1054;  I2  =  6%;  low- quality  evidence;  Analysis  1.4;  Figure  6;  Summary  of  findings for  the  main  comparison).  Limiting  the  analysis  to  studies  of vasodilators  without  a  co-intervention  (vitamin  E,  oestrogen)  did not substantially change the main findings (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.20; 11 RCTs; N = 1054; I2 = 21%; moderate-quality evidence).   We  stratified  the  analysis  by  type  of  vasodilator.  The  test  for subgroup  differences  did  not  clearly  suggest  any  differences between subgroups for this outcome (Chi2 = 9.93, df = 6 (P = 0.13), I2 = 39%).   Five  studies  reported  thickened  endometrium.  Two  assessed isosorbide mononitrate (IMN or ISMN) (Abdel 2017; Mahran 2016), one  amlodipine  (Azmy  2016),  one  sildenafil  (Das  2009),  and  one tadalafil (Magdi Ammar 2017); researchers compared these agents versus placebo or no treatment. The effects shown in each study varied (I2 = 92%) and ranged from a mean difference of 0.80 higher (95% CI 0.18 to 1.42) to 3.57 higher (95% CI 3.01 to 4.13). We are uncertain whether vasodilators improved thickened endometrium, as  we  have  assessed  the  quality  of  the  evidence  as  very  low.  We downgraded  the  quality  of  evidence  because  of  high  risk  of  bias and inconsistency (Analysis 1.5; Summary of findings for the main comparison).   1. Ohl 2002 compared glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) versus placebo. 2. Aleyasin  2009  compared  pentoxifylline  +  tocopherol  vitamin  E   versus no treatment.   3. Abdel  2017  compared  isosorbide  mononitrate  (IMN)  versus   placebo.   Vasodilators  probably  make  little  or  no  difference  in  rates  of multiple gestation or birth compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.42; three RCTs; N = 370; I2 = 0%; moderate- quality evidence) (Analysis 1.6; Summary of findings for the main comparison).   Four studies reported this outcome.   1. Farzi  2005  and  Ohl  2002  compared  glyceryl  trinitrate  (GTN)   versus placebo.   2. Aleyasin  2009  compared  pentoxifylline  +  tocopherol  vitamin  E   versus no treatment.   3. Alieva 2012 compared sildenafil versus no treatment.   In  one  study,  the  miscarriage  rate  in  the  control  group  looked unusually  high  (Alieva  2012).  So,  we  analysed  only  three  studies (Aleyasin 2009; Farzi 2005; Ohl 2002). Vasodilators probably make little  or  no  difference  in  spontaneous  abortion/miscarriage  rates compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.86; three RCTs; N = 350; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence).   Two studies reported this outcome.   1. Ohl 2002 compared glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) versus placebo. 2. Aleyasin  2009  compared  pentoxifylline  +  tocopherol  vitamin  E   versus no treatment.   Vasodilators  probably  make  little  or  no  difference  in  ectopic pregnancy rates compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.48, 95%  CI  0.25  to  8.69;  two  RCTs;  N  =  250;  I2  =  5%;  moderate- quality  evidence;  Analysis  1.6;  Summary  of  findings  for  the  main comparison).   Subgroup analyses   We did not conduct some analyses initially proposed as stratified because we found no suitable studies.   As  none  of  the  included  studies  provided  data  on  the  number of  women  with  endometrium  measured  as  greater  or  less  than  8 mm, we could not perform planned subgroup analyses. Only two studies mentioned that all women had a thin endometrium before interventions were provided (Das 2009; Kim 2010).   Sensitivity analysis   Results of analysis did not change substantially when we excluded studies  of  vasodilators  combined  with  another  drug  (vitamin  E, oestrogen), or when we applied a random-effects model.   Summary of main results   Results  of  this  systematic  review  suggest  that  moderate-quality evidence is insufficient to show that vasodilators improve the live birth rate among women undergoing fertility treatment. However, treatment  with  vasodilators  was  associated  with  an  increased overall rate of side effects compared with placebo or no treatment. Analysis  of  specific  side  effects  revealed  that  headache  and tachycardia were increased.",

         "BACKGROUND\nPulmonary embolism (PE) is relatively common worldwide. It is a serious condition that can be life-threatening. Studies on the relationship between adverse outcomes of this condition and whether a patient is male or female have yielded inconsistent results. Determining whether there is an association between sex and short-term mortality in patients with acute PE is important as this information may help guide different approaches to PE monitoring and treatment.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine whether sex (i.e. being a male or a female patient) is an independent prognostic factor for predicting mortality in adults with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nThe Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register up to 17 February 2023. We scanned conference abstracts and reference lists of included studies and systematic reviews. We also contacted experts to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language or date of publication.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included phase 2-confirmatory prognostic studies, that is, any longitudinal study (prospective or retrospective) evaluating the independent association between sex (male or female) and mortality in adults with acute PE.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe followed the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of prognostic factor studies (CHARMS-PF) and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group template for prognosis reviews. Two review authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias according to the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). Meta-analyses were performed by pooling adjusted estimates. When meta-analysis was not possible, we reported the main results narratively.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included seven studies (726,293 participants), all of which were retrospective cohort studies with participants recruited and managed in hospitals between 2000 and 2018. Studies took place in the USA, Spain, and Japan. Most studies were multicentre. None were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. The participants' mean age ranged from 62 to 69 years, and the proportion of females was higher in six of the seven studies, ranging from 46% to 60%. Sex and gender terms were used inconsistently. Participants received different PE treatments: reperfusion, inferior vena cava filter, anticoagulation, and haemodynamic/respiratory support. The prognostication time (the point from which the outcome was predicted) was frequently omitted. The included studies provided data for three of our outcomes of interest. We did not consider any of the studies to be at an overall low risk of bias for any of the outcomes analysed. We judged the certainty of the evidence as moderate to low due to imprecision and risk of bias. We found moderate-certainty evidence (due to imprecision) that for female patients there is likely a small but clinically important reduction in all-cause mortality at 30 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.92; I2 = 0%; absolute risk difference (ARD) 24 fewer deaths in women per 1000 participants, 95% CI 35 to 10 fewer; 2 studies, 17,627 participants). However, the remaining review outcomes do not indicate lower mortality in female patients. There is low-certainty evidence (due to serious risk of bias and imprecision) indicating that for females with PE, there may be a small but clinically important increase in all-cause hospital mortality (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.22; I2 = 21.7%; 95% prediction interval (PI) 0.76 to 1.61; ARD 13 more deaths in women per 1000 participants, 95% CI 0 to 26 more; 3 studies, 611,210 participants). There is also low-certainty evidence (due to very serious imprecision) indicating that there may be little to no difference between males and females in PE-related mortality at 30 days (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12; I2 = 0%; ARD 4 more deaths in women per 1000 participants, 95% CI 22 fewer to 50 more; 2 studies, 3524 participants). No study data was found for the other outcomes, including sex-specific mortality data at one year. Moreover, due to insufficient studies, many of our planned methods were not implemented. In particular, we were unable to conduct assessments of heterogeneity or publication bias or subgroup and sensitivity analyses.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence is uncertain about sex (being male or female) as an independent prognostic factor for predicting mortality in adults with PE. We found that, for female patients with PE, there is likely a small but clinically important reduction in all-cause mortality at 30 days relative to male patients. However, this result should be interpreted cautiously, as the remaining review outcomes do not point to an association between being female and having a lower risk of death. In fact, the evidence in the review also suggested that, in female patients, there may be a small but clinically important increase in all-cause hospital mortality. It also showed that there may be little to no difference in PE-related mortality at 30 days between male and female patients. There is currently no study evidence from longitudinal studies for our other review outcomes. Although the available evidence is conflicting and therefore cannot support a recommendation for or against routinely considering sex to quantify prognosis or to guide personalised therapeutic approaches for patients with PE, this Cochrane review offers information to guide future primary research and systematic reviews.",

VTE  can  manifest  as  pulmonary\nembolism  (PE)  or  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT).  Pulmonary\nembolism  (PE)  occurs  when  venous  thrombi  dislodge  from  their\nsites of formation and embolize to the pulmonary artery circulation\nsystem  (Konstantinides  2014).  About  50%  of  the  patients  with\npelvic  vein  thrombosis  or  proximal  leg  DVT  develop  PE,  which\nis  often  asymptomatic  (Kearon  2012).  About  90%  of  pulmonary\nemboli  originate  from  the  lower  extremities,  with  most  involving\nthe proximal veins (Lee 2016). Acute PE is the most severe clinical\npresentation of VTE (Konstantinides 2014).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn patients with acute symptomatic PE, initial treatment decisions\nshould  be  driven  by  their  risk  of  short-term  mortality  and  other\nadverse outcomes. When patients have a high-risk for PE associated\ncomplications  (i.e.  haemodynamically  unstable  patients)  they\nneed  to  be  admitted  to  an  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  and  be\ngiven  early  recanalisation  (i.e.  thrombolysis,  percutaneous  or\nsurgical  embolectomy)  in  addition  to  standard  anticoagulation\n(Konstantinides  2014).  In  normotensive  patients,  there  is  a  need\nfor further risk stratification in order to differentiate patients who\nhave  a  low-risk  of  early  PE  complications  from  those  with  an\nintermediate-high  risk  of  PE  complications.  Low-risk  PE  patients\nmay  not  need  to  be  admitted  to  hospital,  and  thus  could  take\nadvantage  of  either  full  outpatient  anticoagulant  therapy  or  a\nshortened hospital stay. Conversely, intermediate- or high-risk PE\npatients have a higher risk of PE complications due to preserved\nsystemic arterial pressure; therefore, these patients could benefit\nfrom  an  intensification  of  therapy  (Barrios  2018).  Several  issues\nshould  be  taken  into  consideration  during  risk  stratification,\nincluding  the  risk  of  bleeding  from  anticoagulants  or  thrombotic\ntherapy, the risk of early venous thromboembolism recurrence and\nthe consequences of these risks.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn patients with high-risk PE, the primary cause of death is acute\nright  ventricle  failure.  Therefore,  the  first  stage  of  treatment  is\nproviding haemodynamic and respiratory support. The next step of\ntreatment is usually anticoagulation for at least three months, as\nthis can prevent premature death (Kearon 2016b; Konstantinides\n2014).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nClinical recognition of PE is often inaccurate due to the signs and\nsymptoms of PE being non-specific. Unfortunately, there is no test\navailable that is sensitive and specific enough to confirm or exclude\nan acute symptomatic PE diagnosis. Therefore, in order to diagnose\nthe disease it is necessary to combine clinical probability, D-dimer\nresults, and imaging testing. In patients assessed for suspected PE,\nit has been shown that adherence to proven diagnostic algorithms\nimproves  patient  prognosis  (Kearon  2012;  Konstantinides  2014;\nRoy 2006). The clinical probability of the patient having PE is the\nfirst  thing  to  be  assessed  and  with  this  information  physicians\ncan  identify  patients  who  require  anticoagulant  treatment  whilst\nwaiting on the results of the diagnostic tests. Clinical decision rules\n(CDR) have been proposed that combine items from the patient's\nclinical history, initial examination and sometimes from the chest\nx-rays or laboratory tests. The Wells and Geneva scores are the most\nextensively validated CDRs (Wells 2000).\n**BLOCK**fs== 74.1**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFor Preview Only\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nPE is relatively common worldwide, and its incidence is increasing\n(Alotaibi 2016; Belohlavek 2013). PE represents the most common\ncause  of  vascular  death  after  myocardial  infarction  and  stroke,\nand  is  the  leading  preventable  cause  of  death  in  hospitalised\npatients (Tapson 2008). No exact worldwide epidemiological data\nare  available,  and  most  PE  cases  are  undiagnosed  and  thus\nuntreated  (Cohen  2007).  In  addition,  many  countries,  especially\nthose  classed  as  developing  countries,  lack  population-based\nestimates for thrombotic conditions (Wendelboe 2016). However,\nthe incidence of PE is estimated to be approximately 60 to 70 per\n100,000  of  the  general  population  in  Europe  (Belohlavek  2013).\nIn the US, the frequency of PE increased from 1998 to 2006, with\nthe  rate  of  PE  detection  nearly  doubling  without  any  change  in\nmortality  (Murphy  2017).  With  better  technology,  clinicians  are\nbetter  equipped  to  detect  previously  missed  pulmonary  emboli,\nbut  these  are  not  necessarily  clinically  relevant  (Doherty  2017;\nWiener 2013). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) estimate between 60,000 to 100,000 deaths per annum from\nPE  in  the  US  (CDC  2015),  which  represents  0.4%  of  all  deaths\nin  the  country  per  annum  (Murphy  2017).  The  mortality  data\nfrom  Australia  and  the  UK  show  a  similar  frequency  to  the  US,\nrepresenting 0.2% (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2015), and 0.4%\n(British Lung Foundation 2015; Office for National Statistics 2013)\nof all deaths, respectively.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nPE  is  now  recognised  as  a  complex  (multifactorial)  disease.  It\ninvolves  both  environmental  exposures  (e.g.  clinical  risk  factors)\nas  well  as  genetic  and  environmental  interactions.  When  PE\nis  associated  with  precipitating  risk  factors  (such  as  surgery,\ncancer,  trauma,  immobilisation,  pregnancy,  or  oral  contraceptive\nuse),  it  is  classified  as  provoked  or  secondary  (Kearon  2016a;\nKonstantinides 2014). When there are no precipitating factors, it is\nknown as unprovoked (Kearon 2016a), spontaneous, or idiopathic.\nOn  the  other  hand,  there  are  several  conditions,  only  present  in\nfemales,  that  are  well-established  risk  factors  for  VTE.  Relevant\nexamples  include  pregnancy  and  the  postpartum  period  (James\n2006;  Kujovich  2004;  Marik  2008;  Morris  2010),  the  use  of  oral\ncontraceptives, which are the most common cause of thrombosis\nin  young  women  (Peragallo  Urrutia  2013;  Stegeman  2013),  and\nhormone replacement therapy (Cushman 2004).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nEpidemiology\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAccording to the short-term prognosis, PE can be classified as low-\nrisk, intermediate-risk or high-risk (Merli 2017). High-risk PE is an\nacute  PE  with  obstructive  shock  or  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)\nlower than 90 mmHg. Intermediate-risk PE is an acute PE without\nsystemic  hypotension  (SBP  ≥  90  mm  Hg),  but  with  either  right\nventricle dysfunction or myocardial necrosis (Murphy 2018). If a PE\nhas none of these severe features, it is called low-risk PE.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nDescription of the prognostic factor\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nA prognostic factor is a characteristic in people with a given health\ncondition  (a  start  point)  that  is  associated  with  a  subsequent\nclinical  outcome  (an  endpoint)  (Hemingway  2013;  Riley  2013).\nTherefore,  prognostic  factors  distinguish  groups  of  people  with\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nSex as a prognostic factor for mortality in adults with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (Review)\nCopyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The  importance  of\nprognosis  research  is  increasingly  recognised,  as  chronic  health\nconditions and diseases are increasingly common and costly.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHealth  equity  is  the  absence  of  avoidable  and  unfair  differences\nin  health  (Welch  2020).  Sex,  gender,  and  sexual  orientation  may\ncontribute  to  health  inequalities  and  health  inequities  (Evans\n2003;  Welch  2020).  'Sex'  refers  to  \"the  biological,  genetic  and\nphysiological  processes  that  generally  distinguish  females  from\nmales, while 'gender' refers to the roles, relationships, behaviours\"\nand other traits that societies ascribe typically to women, men, and\npeople of diverse gender identities (e.g. transgender) (CIHR 2012;\nHeidari 2016).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nin-hospital mortality was significantly higher in females compared\nto males (Agarwal 2015). However, in another study, male patients\nwere seen to have a higher risk of 30-day death compared to female\npatients (Aujesky 2005). Conversely, three other studies found no\nsignificant association between sex and prognosis (Jimenez 2010;\nKeller 2019; Panigada 2016).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTherefore,  it  is  critical  to  determine  if  there  are  sex  differences\nin  the  clinical  course  of  patients  treated  for  PE,  as  this  may\ninform  different  approaches  for  its  detection,  monitoring  and\nmanagement  between  males  and  females.  The  determination\nof  the  prognostic  value  of  sex  can  be  particularly  important  to\nsupport decisions when the benefit-risk balance of an intervention\nis not clear. Some examples identified in recent clinical guidelines\n(Kearon 2016b; Konstantinides 2019) are as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthe  optimal  anticoagulant  drug(s)  and\nregimen  (Kearon  2016b),  particularly  in  patients  with  renal\ninsufficiency and creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min\n(Konstantinides 2019);\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• the  decision  to  administer  reduced-dose  thrombolysis  and\nin  patients  with\nreperfusion  modalities\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncatheter-based\nintermediate- or high-risk PE (Konstantinides 2019);\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\nfor  early  discharge\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn  addition,  the  predictors  of  early  PE-related  death  remain  to\nbe  determined,  and  these  predictors  would  be  useful  to  identify\npossible candidates for reperfusion treatment among patients with\nintermediate-risk  PE  (Konstantinides  2019).  To  know  the  role  of\nsex as a prognostic factor in patients with PE is also essential for\nprofessionals involved in drug discovery and development and for\nauthorities responsible for the regulation and implementation of\ndrug development programmes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn this review, we will assess the potential role of sex (i.e. being a\nmale or a female) as a prognostic factor in patients with PE.

Although  sex  differences  in  arterial  disease  have\nreceived substantial attention, there are still very few studies that\nhave  explored  sex  differences  within  VTE  (Blanco-Molina  2014).\nThere are inconsistent data in studies of patients with proven acute\nPE, in regard to the relationship between sex and adverse outcome\nrates.

Furthermore, all-cause mortality\nis  an  objective  endpoint  and  is  not  susceptible  to  be  biased  by\nthe  outcome  assessor.  We  have  also  defined  different  follow-up\ndurations because we expect delayed effects of PE.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe  defined  all  mortality  outcomes  as  binary  variables  (dead  or\nalive),  instead  of  using  survival  methods.  We  took  this  decision\nas  the  quality  of  life  of  patients  in  the  hospital  can  be  very  poor,\nso patients who die in the hospital do not benefit if the duration\nof their survival is prolonged (Schoenfeld 2005); thus, the critical\noutcome is mortality and not patient survival. Secondly, some PE\npatients  may  be  treated  in  the  ICU:  survival  analysis  should  be\navoided  in  the  ICU  context  (Schoenfeld  2005)  because  Kaplan-\nMeier survival analysis assumes that censoring is non-informative;\nthat  is,  it  considers  that  the  hazard  of  death  remains  unchanged\nwhen  a  censoring  event  occurs  (Wolkewitz  2014).  However,  this\nassumption  is  incorrect  in  the  ICU,  as  discharged  patients  are\nusually  in  a  better  health  condition  than  patients  who  stay.  The\nassumption that censoring is non-informative therefore generates\nartificially  reduced  survival  plots  (Schoenfeld  2005).  There  are\nstatistical  solutions  to  treat  discharge  as  a  competing  event  for\ndeath  in  the  ICU  (Wolkewitz  2014),  but  we  believe  that  from  a\nclinical  point  of  view,  the  relevant  outcome  is  mortality  and  not\nsurvival.\n**BLOCK**fs== 74.1**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFor Preview Only\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe  will  include  studies  involving  patients  with  PE  managed\nin  any  setting.  Summaries  of  prognosis  are  not  meaningful\nunless associated with a particular strategy for treatment so that\nprognostic studies can aid decisions about treatment. This implies\nthat  ideally,  prognostic  factors  should  be  evaluated  either  in  a\ncohort  of  patients  treated  the  same  way,  or  in  a  randomised\ntrial (Altman 2001). We acknowledge that combining studies with\npatients  with  PE  managed  in  any  setting  assumes  that  all  the\ntreatments are equally effective and that the prognosis of patients\nis  independent  of  the  setting.  This  may  not  be  true.  Thus,  the\nvariation in the effects of the treatments may be a relevant source of\nheterogeneity in this review. We also acknowledge that differences\nin hospital admission rates are likely to be related to the hospital-\nand  country-specific  availability  of  hospitals,  admission  policies,\ninsurance  systems,  and  other  factors.  Therefore,  the  patients\nadmitted may not be homogenous. However, we consider that our\nsynthesis will still provide relevant information. Moreover, we will\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe will not consider all-cause mortality in the ICU or PE mortality\nin  the  ICU  because  they  would  only  be  useful  if  the  majority  of\npatients  were  still  in  the  ICU  at  the  time  of  analysis  (Finkelstein\n1994; Schoenfeld 2005).

If  results  from\nmultivariable  analyses  in  the  primary  studies  are  reported  in\nanother form, we will attempt to convert these to ORs at a particular\ntime  point  (See  'Data  extraction  and  management'  above).

Moreover,  ORs  tend  to\nbe  interpreted  as  RRs  by  clinicians  (Deeks  2000).  This  can  be\nmisleading,  as  the  OR  is  similar  to  the  RR  for  outcomes  with  a\nlow  incidence  (<  10%),  but  the  OR  exaggerates  the  effect  when\nthe  incidence  of  the  outcome  increases  (Zhang  1998).  This  may\nbe the case in our review, because all-cause mortality in patients\nwho  are  treated  for  PE  is  30%  in  high-income  countries  (Klok\n2010; Ng 2011), while the PE-related mortality in patients treated\nfor  PE  is  estimated  between  2%  and  10%  (Belohlavek  2013;  den\nExter 2013; Konstantinides 2016). To facilitate interpretation of the\nresults, we will undertake each meta-analysis based on ORs, and\nexpress  the  meta-analysis  as  an  OR.  However,  the  'Summary  of\nfindings' table(s) will also present illustrative comparative risks and\nthe absolute risk reductions (ARR) for the effect of the prognostic\nfactor. To calculate the ARRs we will consider a range of different\nprevalences of the prognostic factor (being a female) and different\nrisks of the outcome in the entire cohort. See 'Transformations of\nreported data and assumptions made' for details on the formula we\nwill use to convert the data.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSubgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe  plan  to  investigate  if  the  following  prespecified  factors  can\nexplain heterogeneity If there are at least two studies per subgroup:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n• Assessment of clinical heterogeneity\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe  plan  to  combine  results  in  a  meta-analysis  independently  of\ntheir RoB and the factors considered for adjustment. However, we\nwill  assess  the  impact  of  this  decision  by  sensitivity  analysis.  We\nalso  plan  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  the  statistical  model  used\nto  pool  data  on  the  prognostic  effect  estimate  (see  'Sensitivity\nanalysis').\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe  DerSimonian  and  Laird  (DL)  method  is  the  most  commonly\nused random-effects model, and is available in Review Manager 5\nstatistical software (Review Manager 2014). However, this method\nhas  long  been  challenged  (Veroniki  2019)  because  it  produces  a\n95%  CI  that  is  too  narrow  (and  P  values  that  are  typically  too\nsmall)  under  two  circumstances  that  this  review  will  probably\nmeet: a small number of studies and the presence of substantive\ndifferences  among  study  estimates  (Cornell  2014;  Riley  2019).\nTherefore,  we  plan  to  use  the  Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman\n(HKSJ) method for random effects meta-analysis, as it has shown\nto  consistently  result  in  more  adequate  error  rates  than  the  DL\nmethod, especially when the number of studies is small (IntHout\n2014). However, we will take into consideration that even with the\nHKSJ  method,  extra  caution  is  needed  when  there  are  less  than\nsix  studies  of  very  unequal  sizes  (IntHout  2014).  We  plan  to  use\nthe Cochrane Review Manager 5 software (Review Manager 2014)\nfor  organising  the  text  of  the  review.  We  will  use  the  'metareg'\ncommand  in  Stata  to  perform  the  meta-analysis  with  the  HKSJ\nmethod (Harbord 2008).\n**BLOCK**fs== 74.1**p== 16.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFor Preview Only\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIf  we  find  relevant  unexplained  statistical  heterogeneity,  we  will\nstill  meta-analyse  the  data,  but  we  will  downgrade  the  certainty\nof the prognostic effect estimate as part of the GRADE assessment\n(see  below).

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD013835.pub2.   Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.   Venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  is  a  common  cardiovascular disease  that  involves  the  formation  of  a  blood  clot  (thrombus) in  a  vein  (Bartholomew  2017).  VTE  can  manifest  as  pulmonary embolism  (PE)  or  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT).  Pulmonary embolism  (PE)  occurs  when  venous  thrombi  dislodge  from  their sites of formation and embolize to the pulmonary artery circulation system  (Konstantinides  2014).  About  50%  of  the  patients  with pelvic  vein  thrombosis  or  proximal  leg  DVT  develop  PE,  which is  often  asymptomatic  (Kearon  2012).  About  90%  of  pulmonary emboli  originate  from  the  lower  extremities,  with  most  involving the proximal veins (Lee 2016). Acute PE is the most severe clinical presentation of VTE (Konstantinides 2014).   In patients with acute symptomatic PE, initial treatment decisions should  be  driven  by  their  risk  of  short-term  mortality  and  other adverse outcomes. When patients have a high-risk for PE associated complications  (i.e.  haemodynamically  unstable  patients)  they need  to  be  admitted  to  an  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  and  be given  early  recanalisation  (i.e.  thrombolysis,  percutaneous  or surgical  embolectomy)  in  addition  to  standard  anticoagulation (Konstantinides  2014).  In  normotensive  patients,  there  is  a  need for further risk stratification in order to differentiate patients who have  a  low-risk  of  early  PE  complications  from  those  with  an intermediate-high  risk  of  PE  complications.  Low-risk  PE  patients may  not  need  to  be  admitted  to  hospital,  and  thus  could  take advantage  of  either  full  outpatient  anticoagulant  therapy  or  a shortened hospital stay. Conversely, intermediate- or high-risk PE patients have a higher risk of PE complications due to preserved systemic arterial pressure; therefore, these patients could benefit from  an  intensification  of  therapy  (Barrios  2018).  Several  issues should  be  taken  into  consideration  during  risk  stratification, including  the  risk  of  bleeding  from  anticoagulants  or  thrombotic therapy, the risk of early venous thromboembolism recurrence and the consequences of these risks.   In patients with high-risk PE, the primary cause of death is acute right  ventricle  failure.  Therefore,  the  first  stage  of  treatment  is providing haemodynamic and respiratory support. The next step of treatment is usually anticoagulation for at least three months, as this can prevent premature death (Kearon 2016b; Konstantinides 2014).   Clinical recognition of PE is often inaccurate due to the signs and symptoms of PE being non-specific. Unfortunately, there is no test available that is sensitive and specific enough to confirm or exclude an acute symptomatic PE diagnosis. Therefore, in order to diagnose the disease it is necessary to combine clinical probability, D-dimer results, and imaging testing. In patients assessed for suspected PE, it has been shown that adherence to proven diagnostic algorithms improves  patient  prognosis  (Kearon  2012;  Konstantinides  2014; Roy 2006). The clinical probability of the patient having PE is the first  thing  to  be  assessed  and  with  this  information  physicians can  identify  patients  who  require  anticoagulant  treatment  whilst waiting on the results of the diagnostic tests. Clinical decision rules (CDR) have been proposed that combine items from the patient's clinical history, initial examination and sometimes from the chest x-rays or laboratory tests. The Wells and Geneva scores are the most extensively validated CDRs (Wells 2000).   PE is relatively common worldwide, and its incidence is increasing (Alotaibi 2016; Belohlavek 2013). PE represents the most common cause  of  vascular  death  after  myocardial  infarction  and  stroke, and  is  the  leading  preventable  cause  of  death  in  hospitalised patients (Tapson 2008). No exact worldwide epidemiological data are  available,  and  most  PE  cases  are  undiagnosed  and  thus untreated  (Cohen  2007).  In  addition,  many  countries,  especially those  classed  as  developing  countries,  lack  population-based estimates for thrombotic conditions (Wendelboe 2016). However, the incidence of PE is estimated to be approximately 60 to 70 per 100,000  of  the  general  population  in  Europe  (Belohlavek  2013). In the US, the frequency of PE increased from 1998 to 2006, with the  rate  of  PE  detection  nearly  doubling  without  any  change  in mortality  (Murphy  2017).  With  better  technology,  clinicians  are better  equipped  to  detect  previously  missed  pulmonary  emboli, but  these  are  not  necessarily  clinically  relevant  (Doherty  2017; Wiener 2013). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate between 60,000 to 100,000 deaths per annum from PE  in  the  US  (CDC  2015),  which  represents  0.4%  of  all  deaths in  the  country  per  annum  (Murphy  2017).  The  mortality  data from  Australia  and  the  UK  show  a  similar  frequency  to  the  US, representing 0.2% (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2015), and 0.4% (British Lung Foundation 2015; Office for National Statistics 2013) of all deaths, respectively.   PE  is  now  recognised  as  a  complex  (multifactorial)  disease.  It involves  both  environmental  exposures  (e.g.  clinical  risk  factors) as  well  as  genetic  and  environmental  interactions.  When  PE is  associated  with  precipitating  risk  factors  (such  as  surgery, cancer,  trauma,  immobilisation,  pregnancy,  or  oral  contraceptive use),  it  is  classified  as  provoked  or  secondary  (Kearon  2016a; Konstantinides 2014). When there are no precipitating factors, it is known as unprovoked (Kearon 2016a), spontaneous, or idiopathic. On  the  other  hand,  there  are  several  conditions,  only  present  in females,  that  are  well-established  risk  factors  for  VTE.  Relevant examples  include  pregnancy  and  the  postpartum  period  (James 2006;  Kujovich  2004;  Marik  2008;  Morris  2010),  the  use  of  oral contraceptives, which are the most common cause of thrombosis in  young  women  (Peragallo  Urrutia  2013;  Stegeman  2013),  and hormone replacement therapy (Cushman 2004).   According to the short-term prognosis, PE can be classified as low- risk, intermediate-risk or high-risk (Merli 2017). High-risk PE is an acute  PE  with  obstructive  shock  or  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP) lower than 90 mmHg. Intermediate-risk PE is an acute PE without systemic  hypotension  (SBP  ≥  90  mm  Hg),  but  with  either  right ventricle dysfunction or myocardial necrosis (Murphy 2018). If a PE has none of these severe features, it is called low-risk PE.   Description of the prognostic factor   A prognostic factor is a characteristic in people with a given health condition  (a  start  point)  that  is  associated  with  a  subsequent clinical  outcome  (an  endpoint)  (Hemingway  2013;  Riley  2013). Therefore,  prognostic  factors  distinguish  groups  of  people  with   a  different  average  prognosis  (Riley  2013).  The  importance  of prognosis  research  is  increasingly  recognised,  as  chronic  health conditions and diseases are increasingly common and costly.   Health  equity  is  the  absence  of  avoidable  and  unfair  differences in  health  (Welch  2020).  Sex,  gender,  and  sexual  orientation  may contribute  to  health  inequalities  and  health  inequities  (Evans 2003;  Welch  2020).  'Sex'  refers  to  \"the  biological,  genetic  and physiological  processes  that  generally  distinguish  females  from males, while 'gender' refers to the roles, relationships, behaviours\" and other traits that societies ascribe typically to women, men, and people of diverse gender identities (e.g. transgender) (CIHR 2012; Heidari 2016).   in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in females compared to males (Agarwal 2015). However, in another study, male patients were seen to have a higher risk of 30-day death compared to female patients (Aujesky 2005). Conversely, three other studies found no significant association between sex and prognosis (Jimenez 2010; Keller 2019; Panigada 2016).   Therefore,  it  is  critical  to  determine  if  there  are  sex  differences in  the  clinical  course  of  patients  treated  for  PE,  as  this  may inform  different  approaches  for  its  detection,  monitoring  and management  between  males  and  females.  The  determination of  the  prognostic  value  of  sex  can  be  particularly  important  to support decisions when the benefit-risk balance of an intervention is not clear. Some examples identified in recent clinical guidelines (Kearon 2016b; Konstantinides 2019) are as follows:   the  optimal  anticoagulant  drug(s)  and regimen  (Kearon  2016b),  particularly  in  patients  with  renal insufficiency and creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min (Konstantinides 2019);   • the  decision  to  administer  reduced-dose  thrombolysis  and in  patients  with reperfusion  modalities   catheter-based intermediate- or high-risk PE (Konstantinides 2019);   for  early  discharge   In  addition,  the  predictors  of  early  PE-related  death  remain  to be  determined,  and  these  predictors  would  be  useful  to  identify possible candidates for reperfusion treatment among patients with intermediate-risk  PE  (Konstantinides  2019).  To  know  the  role  of sex as a prognostic factor in patients with PE is also essential for professionals involved in drug discovery and development and for authorities responsible for the regulation and implementation of drug development programmes.   In this review, we will assess the potential role of sex (i.e. being a male or a female) as a prognostic factor in patients with PE. This review will not evaluate the association between gender or sexual orientation and the outcomes of patients with PE.   We  will  assess  the  association  between  sex  (being  a  male  or a  female)  and  mortality  in  patients  with  PE  by  evaluating  the outcomes of all-cause mortality and PE-related mortality. All-cause mortality  is  death  from  any  cause  following  the  diagnosis  of  PE. PE-related mortality is defined as death confirmed by autopsy, or those deaths following a clinically severe PE, in the absence of any alternative diagnosis (Muriel 2014).   • the  criteria   • the  choice  of   for  selecting  patients   PE is the most common cause of vascular death after myocardial infarction and stroke, and the leading preventable cause of death in  hospitalised  patients  (Tapson  2008).  Therefore,  the  effective management  of  PE  is  among  the  top  priorities  for  improving survival rates in patients with thromboembolic disorders.   Prognostic factor research aims to identify factors associated with clinical  outcomes  in  people  with  a  particular  disease  or  health condition  (Hemingway  2013;  Riley  2013).  There  can  be  different uses of the evidence on individual prognostic factors:   1. to  define  modifiable  targets  for  interventions  to  improve   Prognostic  factors  are  relevant  to  patient  management  as  they help  to  stratify  patients  by  different  risk  groups,  thus  helping  to reduce morbidity and mortality (Riley 2013). The identification of prognostic factors is a crucial step within the current drive towards personalised medicine (Riley 2013; Trusheim 2007).   2. to build blocks for prognostic models; and 3. to determine predictors of differential treatment response (Riley   outcomes;   Biological differences between the sexes can result in differential health  risks,  disease  incidence,  and  health  service  needs  (O'Neill 2014).  Sex  differences  in  the  presentation  and  clinical  course  of conditions  may  dictate  different  approaches  to  detection  and management.  Although  sex  differences  in  arterial  disease  have received substantial attention, there are still very few studies that have  explored  sex  differences  within  VTE  (Blanco-Molina  2014). There are inconsistent data in studies of patients with proven acute PE, in regard to the relationship between sex and adverse outcome rates.  For  example,  in  a  study  of  276,484  patients  with  acute  PE,   This  protocol  follows  the  methods  proposed  in  other  Cochrane prognosis  reviews  (Hayden  2014;  Skoetz  2017;  Westby  2018). Moreover,  we  followed  the  guidance  provided  in  Riley  2019  and the general protocol template of the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group  (Cochrane  Prognosis  Methods  Group  2019).  Our  protocol report  adheres  to  the  guideline  for  Preferred  Reporting  Items for  Systematic  Review  and  Meta-Analysis  Protocols  (PRISMA-P) Statement (Shamseer 2015). The review report will conform to the guidance of the PRISMA Statement (Liberati 2009), supplemented with the CHARMS-Prognostic factor checklist (Moons 2014). We will also follow the guidance for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prognostic factor studies (Riley 2019).   Criteria for considering studies for this review   We have formulated the review question according to the PICOTS system. This format is based on the CHARMS checklist and informs   To  determine  whether  sex  (i.e.  being  a  male  or  a  female)  is  an independent  (i.e.  autonomous)  prognostic  factor  for  predicting mortality  in  adults  with  acute  symptomatic  PE.

See Table 1.   We  will  include  all  adults,  hospitalised  or  not,  treated  for  acute symptomatic PE confirmed by objective testing, such as pulmonary angiography, ventilation/perfusion lung scan, or another validated measurement.   • Adult: person aged 16 years or older (in many settings, age 16 is   when patients leave paediatric care and enter adult care)   • PE: defined as the dislodgement of venous thrombi from their site of formation and their embolization to the pulmonary artery circulation system (Konstantinides 2014)   • Acute: the follow-up should start no later than fifteen days after   • Symptomatic: at least chest symptoms must be present, such   • Objective testing confirmation: we will consider the following as  valid  examples  of  objective  testing:  high  probability ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy; positive contrast-enhanced, PE protocol; helical chest computerised tomography for PE; or lower limb compression ultrasonography, positive for proximal DVT   We will include studies regardless if the patients were treated for PE or not, providing the diagnosis for PE was confirmed.   We  will  exclude  studies  with  at  least  one  of  the  following characteristics.   • Studies conducted in animals, cadavers or in vitro • Studies conducted in females or males only, as they do not allow   disease   diagnosis   as dyspnoea or chest pain   • Descriptive  studies  describing  the  course  of  the  condition/   We  will  include  any  longitudinal  study,  randomised  or  non- randomised,  investigating  the  prognostic  significance  of  sex  in adults  with  PE  for  predicting  mortality.  In  practical  terms,  the following  study  designs  will  be  eligible  (Foroutan  2020):  a) observational  studies  (e.g.  cohort  studies,  case-control  studies, or  database  linkage  studies);  and  b)  secondary  analyses  of experimental  studies  (randomised  or  non-randomised)  providing evidence  regarding  prognosis.  For  an  experimental  study  to  be eligible,  it  must  have  used  either  the  control  group  alone  or  the entire study cohort adjusted for the intervention.   We will exclude the following study designs, but we will report them in  the  'Characteristics  of  excluded  studies'  table  if  the  remaining eligibility criteria were met:   (‘exploratory studies’):  studies  aimed  at  investigating  all  associations, usually  in  univariate  analyses,  of  potential  prognostic  factors and  outcomes.  These  studies  are  necessary  to  identify  new prognostic  factors,  but  they  will  not  be  eligible  for  our review  because  they  provide  the  least  conclusive  information regarding the independence of a variable as a valid prognostic factor.  Moreover,  due  to  the  high  number  of  factors  explored, exploratory  studies  often  have  widely  varying  results  with common  spurious  associations,  which  may  overstate  their conclusions (Hayden 2008; Hayden 2014).   interactions  between intervention  and  prognostic for  example,  a randomised controlled trial (RCT) or other study reporting only treatment effect modification data   * Studies to validate a prediction model (that is, to validate the model in patient data not used in the development process) * Studies  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  a  prognostic  model  on   * Studies  to  develop  a  prediction  model  (independently,  if it  reports  any  association  of  sex  with  any  of  our  review outcomes)   • Other studies reporting univariate associations • Phase-3 prognostic studies: studies to understand prognostic pathways.  We  will  exclude  these  studies  because  our  review aims to determine the prognostic role of just one factor.   We  will  not  exclude  any  study  based  on  sample  size,  duration  of follow-up, publication status, publication year or language. We will exclude studies that fulfil all our review eligibility criteria, but do not assess or report our outcomes of interest (see ‘Selection of studies,’ below).   determination of the role of sex   clinical practice and outcomes   Types of prognostic factors   Index prognostic factor   factors:   • Studies conducted with healthy volunteers • Studies where all the participants were children or adolescents (younger  than  age  16).  We  will  exclude  these  studies  because PE  presents  clinical  and  prognostic  peculiarities  in  these  age groups,  as  compared  with  in  adults  (Navanandan  2019;  Zaidi 2017)   • Studies where the participants did not have confirmed PE • Studies including only a subset of the participants relevant to our  review  question  will  not  be  eligible  but  will  be  listed  in the ‘Characteristics of excluded studies’ table if they meet the remaining review criteria, but we are unable to extract the data of interest.   We will include studies that assess the role of sex as a prognostic factor.  Sex,  categorised  as  female  or  male,  relates  to  a  set  of biological  attributes  in  humans  and  animals  (Heidari  2016).  In particular,  sex  refers  to  the  biological,  genetic  and  physiological processes  that  generally  distinguish  females  from  males,  and  is associated with features including chromosomes, gene expression, hormone  function  and  reproductive/sexual  anatomy  (Heidari 2016).  We  will  preferably  include  studies  ascertaining  sex  by genotyping  of  a  blood  sample  (Clayton  2016).  However,  we  will accept any assessment of sex as provided by the study authors.   The concepts of sex and gender are distinct but interrelated (Doull 2010).  However,  this  review  will  not  assess  the  role  of  gender as  a  prognostic  factor.  Gender  refers  to  the  roles,  relationships,   Appendix  1  details  the  study  design  features  (i.e.  more  than  the reported  study  design  labels)  that  we  have  considered  to  define study design eligibility.   behaviours, relative power, and other traits that societies generally ascribe  to  women  and  men,  as  well  as  people  of  diverse  gender identities (e.g. transgender persons) (Heidari 2016).   We acknowledge that 'sex' and 'gender' are poorly described and reported  in  published  articles  (Doull  2010;  Lopez-Alcalde  2019; Runnels 2014; Welch 2017). If the reporting is unclear or incorrect, we will try to contact the authors for clarification. If no additional information is provided, we will generally assume that the study is considering sex, unless the authors explicitly state that they have evaluated the social aspect.   We  will  consider  all-cause  mortality  and  PE-related  mortality measured at different time points, all of them defined as primary outcomes.  We  provide  the  complete  definition  for  each  outcome according to the criteria adapted from Saldanha 2014.   Please note that we anticipate that we may modify the draft list, if  and  when  we  find  new  evidence  that  justifies  any  changes. Appendix 2 describes the process that we followed in selecting the covariates for adjustment.   The focus of this review will be on the adjusted prognostic value of  sex,  that  is,  its  prognostic  effect  after  adjusting  for  other covariates. Adjustment for the following key covariates, most taken from  the  scale  of  the  Simplified  PESI  (sPESI)  (Jimenez  2010)  for mortality  in  patients  with  PE,  will  be  of  interest:  age,  history  of cancer, current cancer, history of chronic cardiopulmonary disease, current chronic cardiopulmonary disease, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and O2 saturation. We will consider this list to assess the adjustment domain in the 'Risk of bias' tool (see 'Assessment of risk of bias in included studies').

For example, from the recruitment, from the diagnosis of PE, from the allocation to the study arm, from the admission to the hospital, from the admission to the ICU or from the start of the treatment. We will preferably use the start of the PE diagnosis, but if this information is not available, we will consider the time as provided by the study authors. We will assess the impact of this decision by sensitivity analysis.   hHowever, we will admit any definition as provided by the authors   iExcept for those participants that died or were discharged within this period   PE: pulmonary embolism   jExcept for those participants that died within this period   for  this We  attempted  to  select  a review  by  searching  the  COMET  initiative  database  (www.comet- initiative.org).  We  found  one  defined  and  published  set,  but  this focused on trials in children and therefore was not addressing our review question. As a consequence, we have selected the outcomes listed above based on the following criteria:   1. the outcome must be critical from a patient perspective; 2. the outcome must support decision-making in the management   try to explore the role of the region where the studies were carried out by subgroup analysis.   Search methods for identification of studies   Electronic searches   The  Cochrane  Vascular  Information  Specialist  aims  to  identify all  relevant  studies  regardless  of  language  or  publication  status (published, unpublished, in press, or in progress).   The Information Specialist will search the following databases for relevant studies:   • the  Cochrane  Vascular  Specialised  Register  via  the  Cochrane   • the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via   the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO);   • Medline  (Ovid  MEDLINE®  Epub  Ahead  of  Print,  In-Process  & Other  Non-Indexed  Citations,  Ovid  MEDLINE®  Daily  and  Ovid MEDLINE®) (1946 onwards);   The Information Specialist has devised a draft search strategy for MEDLINE which is displayed in Appendix 3.This will be used as the basis for search strategies for the other databases listed.   The Information Specialist will search the following trials registries:   • The  World  Health  Organization  International  Clinical  Trials   of patients with PE.   Register of Studies (CRS-Web);   • ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov).   Registry Platform (who.int/trialsearch);   • Embase Ovid (from 1974 onwards); • CINAHL Ebsco (from 1982 onwards).   We  chose  'all-cause  mortality'  as  a  primary  outcome  because it  has  the  greatest  clinical  relevance  and  is  the  most  important outcome for individuals with PE. Furthermore, all-cause mortality is  an  objective  endpoint  and  is  not  susceptible  to  be  biased  by the  outcome  assessor.  We  have  also  defined  different  follow-up durations because we expect delayed effects of PE.   We  defined  all  mortality  outcomes  as  binary  variables  (dead  or alive),  instead  of  using  survival  methods.  We  took  this  decision as  the  quality  of  life  of  patients  in  the  hospital  can  be  very  poor, so patients who die in the hospital do not benefit if the duration of their survival is prolonged (Schoenfeld 2005); thus, the critical outcome is mortality and not patient survival. Secondly, some PE patients  may  be  treated  in  the  ICU:  survival  analysis  should  be avoided  in  the  ICU  context  (Schoenfeld  2005)  because  Kaplan- Meier survival analysis assumes that censoring is non-informative; that  is,  it  considers  that  the  hazard  of  death  remains  unchanged when  a  censoring  event  occurs  (Wolkewitz  2014).  However,  this assumption  is  incorrect  in  the  ICU,  as  discharged  patients  are usually  in  a  better  health  condition  than  patients  who  stay.  The assumption that censoring is non-informative therefore generates artificially  reduced  survival  plots  (Schoenfeld  2005).  There  are statistical  solutions  to  treat  discharge  as  a  competing  event  for death  in  the  ICU  (Wolkewitz  2014),  but  we  believe  that  from  a clinical  point  of  view,  the  relevant  outcome  is  mortality  and  not survival.   We  will  include  studies  involving  patients  with  PE  managed in  any  setting.  Summaries  of  prognosis  are  not  meaningful unless associated with a particular strategy for treatment so that prognostic studies can aid decisions about treatment. This implies that  ideally,  prognostic  factors  should  be  evaluated  either  in  a cohort  of  patients  treated  the  same  way,  or  in  a  randomised trial (Altman 2001). We acknowledge that combining studies with patients  with  PE  managed  in  any  setting  assumes  that  all  the treatments are equally effective and that the prognosis of patients is  independent  of  the  setting.  This  may  not  be  true.  Thus,  the variation in the effects of the treatments may be a relevant source of heterogeneity in this review. We also acknowledge that differences in hospital admission rates are likely to be related to the hospital- and  country-specific  availability  of  hospitals,  admission  policies, insurance  systems,  and  other  factors.  Therefore,  the  patients admitted may not be homogenous. However, we consider that our synthesis will still provide relevant information. Moreover, we will   We will not consider all-cause mortality in the ICU or PE mortality in  the  ICU  because  they  would  only  be  useful  if  the  majority  of patients  were  still  in  the  ICU  at  the  time  of  analysis  (Finkelstein 1994; Schoenfeld 2005). Thus, we will consider all-cause mortality to include all deaths at the hospital, inclusive of ICU deaths.   Searching other resources   We  will  use  the  Web  of  Science  database  from  Clarivate (clarivate.com/products/web-of-science)  to  track  articles  that have  cited  the  primary  reference  for  each  study included in  this  review.  We  will  also  search  the  publisher  web  sites, PubMed  (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)  and  the  Retraction Watch  database  (www.retractionwatch.com)  for  retractions  and comments related to references of included studies.   We  will  search  for  conference  abstracts  of  major  symposia  from 2010.   1. Meetings of the OSSD: 5th edition (2010) to 14th edition (2019) 2.

We will contact experts on the topic (including authors of included studies, authors of systematic reviews) to identify any additional, unreported or ongoing studies.   We will handsearch documents of the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD).   7. Acute Cardiovascular Care (ACC): 2010 to 2019 8. European Society of Cardiology (ESC): 2010 to 2019   We will use the CHARMS-PF guidance to extract data (Riley 2019). This  form  adapts  the  original  CHARMS  checklist  (CHecklist  for critical  Appraisal  and  data  extraction  for  systematic  Reviews  of prediction Modelling Studies) for prognostic factor studies (Moons 2014), based on the experience of conducting systematic reviews of  prognostic  factor  studies  (Riley  2019).  We  will  extract  key information from each primary study.   • Dates, country and setting in which the study was conducted • Study design • Eligibility criteria • Participants details • Pulmonary embolism diagnostic criteria • Treatment details • Details of the prognostic factor:   (for  example,  self-reported  or  by   • Definition of start points • Outcomes reported • For  each  review  outcome,  we  will  extract  the  information  as described in the 'Types of outcome measures' section (Saldanha 2014)   genotyping of blood sample)   * Sex definition * Sex  measurement   • Duration of study follow-up • Type of analysis:   If  necessary,  we  will  ask  the  study  authors  for  clarification.  If  we cannot clarify the issues and we cannot exclude the study for any reason we will put these studies into 'awaiting classification'.   We will use the EPPI-Reviewer web-based software (Park 2018) to implement the selection process. We will complete a PRISMA flow chart to describe the selection process (Liberati 2009). We will also create  tables  describing  the  characteristics  of  excluded  studies. These  tables  will  detail  the  main  reason  for  exclusion  for  studies that a reader might otherwise expect to see included in the review.   Two  of  six  review  authors  (BF,  CAQL,  DJ,  ES,  JLA,  RP),  will independently  check  all  titles  and  abstracts  for  inclusion.  We will  classify  the  titles  and  abstracts  into  four  groups:  'obviously irrelevant', 'potentially eligible', 'potentially excluded' or 'unclear'. We  will  obtain  the  full-text  version  of  those  records  classified  as 'potentially eligible', 'potentially excluded' or 'unclear'. Two of six review  authors  (BF,  CAQL,  DJ,  ES,  JLA,  RP)  will  independently assess  the  eligibility  of  each  selected  full-text  article.  We  will resolve disagreements by consensus. In the case of disagreement, a  third  review  author  (one  of  AM,  DJ,  JLA  or  JZ)  will  serve  as  a neutral arbiter. There will be no restriction on language or date of publication of the papers.   We will exclude studies that fulfil all our review eligibility criteria, except the outcomes, i.e. studies in which no outcome of interest for the review was assessed or reported. For example, we will exclude a phase-2 prognostic study that aimed to determine whether sex is  an  independent  prognostic  factor  for  predicting  the  length  of stay  of  patients  with  PE.  We  acknowledge  that  the  exclusion  of studies  based  on  the  reporting  of  the  outcomes  will  hamper  our evaluation  of  the  risk  of  bias  derived  from  selective  outcome reporting.  However,  we  anticipate  that  including  all  prognostic studies  independently  of  the  outcome  reported  will  generate  a workload  that  unaffordable  to  the  team  resources.  On  the  other hand, we will not exclude studies based on their timing. For studies reporting several follow-ups for the same outcome, we will choose the most appropriate one for analysis.   If  there  are  multiple  reports  of  the  same  study  or  data  sets  that overlap, we will collate them so that each study (not each report), is the unit of interest in the review. We will extract data from the data set with the largest sample size, most detailed results and the most appropriate follow-up.   of association (if available) • Methods used to handle missing data • Attrition:   * Loss to follow-up * Reasons   estimate the prognostic association   (RRs) hazard ratios (HRs)   adopted)   Two  of  five  review  authors  (BF,  CAQ,  DJ,  ES  and  JLA)  will independently  extract  data  of  each  included  study.

A third review  author  (AM)  will  check  the  accuracy  of  the  numeric  data in the review. We will try to obtain crucial missing information or clarification from study authors or organisations.

We  will pilot  the  data  extraction  form  with  five  studies  for  usability.  We will  summarise  the  information  retrieved  in  a  table  detailing  the characteristics of each included study.   The two key elements that must be extracted from each primary study  to  estimate  the  effect  of  a  prognostic  factor  with  a  meta- analysis are the prognostic factor effect estimate and its precision (that  is,  the  SE  or  the  95%  CI)  (Riley  2019).  If  needed,  we  plan to  undertake  transformations  of  reported  data  to  use  data  from as many studies as possible. Thus, we will attempt to restore the missing  information  and  to  standardise  the  data  to  our  desired format.   Tool to assess the risk of bias   We will use the QUIPS (Quality In Prognosis Studies) tool to assess the  risk  of  bias  (RoB)  (Hayden  2013;  Riley  2019).  The  tool  has  six domains (with signalling questions related to each domain that can inform judgments of RoB in prognostic research):   For each study, we will label the six domains for each prognostic factor-outcome combination. Therefore, we will assess the RoB per outcome. We will make a judgement for each domain choosing one of the following options (Riley 2019):   • Low risk: the criterion is adequately fulfilled in the study • High risk: the criterion is not adequately fulfilled in the study • Moderate risk: there is not sufficient information provided to be   able to make a clear judgement on the RoB.   We will detail and justify judgements on RoB in a 'Risk of bias table' for  each  included  study.  We  will  also  generate  RoB  graphs  and figures.   Overall assessment of the risk of bias and incorporation into analyses   All  the  tool  domains  will  be  'key  domains'  for  RoB.  Thus,  we will  summarise  the  RoB  for  each  prognostic  factor-outcome combination  in  two  different  manners,  'within  each  study'  and 'across studies' (Higgins 2011).   We will present the associations consistently, that is, associations above  one  will  indicate  a  worse  prognosis  for  women  (higher mortality). If necessary, we will recalculate the associations to be in the same direction.   To  convert  the  data,  we  plan  to  follow  the  guidance  described in  Westby  2018  ('Measures  of  association'  section),  Riley  2019 ('Methods to restore the missing information upon data extraction' section),  and  the  Cochrane  Handbook  Section  7.7  (Higgins  2011) and Section 12.5.4 (Schünemann 2011). If needed, we will perform the  conversions  with  the  calculator  available  in  Review  Manager 5.3 (Review Manager 2014). Before concluding that the necessary information to calculate a prognostic association is not available, we will consult Cochrane Prognosis Methods.   As  stated  below  in  'Type  of  measure  of  association',  we  will attempt  to  consider  the  OR  and  its  95%  CI  as  the  common measure of prognostic association in all the studies. We will also try  to  convert  the  combined  OR  to  an  absolute  risk  reduction (ARR)  to  facilitate  its  interpretation.  To  compute  the  ARR  from an  OR,  we  will  use  the  Absolute  Risk  Calculator  provided  by the  Health  Information  Research  Unit  at  McMaster  University (hiru.mcmaster.ca/AbsoluteRiskCalculator). We will also obtain the lower  and  upper  limits  of  the  CI  95%  of  the  ARR  by  applying  the same  formula  to  the  lower  and  upper  confidence  limits  of  the adjusted OR.   1.

Statistical analysis and reporting   Moderate risk of bias for one or more key domains (and no domain is rated as high risk)   Plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results   Within each study across different domains   High risk of bias for one or more key domains   Plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results   Plausible bias unlikely to se- riously alter the results   Low risk of bias for all key domains   Moderate risk of bias   High risk of bias   Low risk of bias   Across studies   Most information is from studies at low risk of bias   Most information is from studies at low or moderate risk of bias   The proportion of information from studies at high risk of bias is sufficient to affect the interpretation of results   Risk of bias for each prognostic factor-outcome combination   We will describe the RoB among the included studies in the results section.  Also,  we  will  consider  the  RoB  across  studies  for  each prognostic  effect  estimation,  as  part  of  the  determination  of  the quality of the evidence with the GRADE system (Guyatt 2011).   We will meta-analyse studies independently of their RoB, but we will explore the effect of this decision by carrying out a sensitivity analysis.   If  a  study  provides  adjusted  estimates  but  not  adjusted  for  our minimal set of adjustment factors, we will meta-analyse the study, but we will 'penalise' the estimate as part of the RoB assessment (we will assess the impact of this decision by sensitivity analysis). If less than four of the key factors are adjusted for in the study, it will be assessed as high risk of bias in the adjustment domain of the risk of bias tool. However, if four or more of the key factors are adjusted for, the study will be defined as low risk of bias for this domain. If the study only adjusted for PESI/sPESI but did not detail for which individual factors they had adjusted, we will mark the RoB domain as moderate.   If  the  same  study  presents  different  estimates  for  the  same outcome, each of them adjusted for different factors, we will extract for meta-analysis the estimate that has adjusted for the maximum number of our key covariates. If there are several estimations, all of  them  having  adjusted  for  our  key  covariates,  we  will  consider the  estimate  adjusted  for  more  of  our  key  covariates  in  total.  We assume that this will minimise the risk of confounding bias in the estimation.   Concerning  the  dichotomisation  of  our  key  covariates,  we  will accept any cut-off used by the primary authors. We acknowledge that  different  cut-offs  for  the  same  covariate  will  occur  among studies and that this situation may affect the prognostic estimate obtained in our review. Thus, we will perform sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of our decision by excluding studies that have adjusted  for  PESI  (or  PESI  simplified)  measured  as  a  categorical variable.   Two of five review authors (AM, BF, DJ, ES, JLA) will independently appraise  all  the  domains  of  the  QUIPS  tool  for  each  included study. We will agree on the final judgements for each domain via consensus.  A  second  review  author  (JLA  or  JZ)  will  intervene  if there are disagreements. A third review author (AM) will check the final  decisions.  If  the  study  report  does  not  provide  information for  a  domain,  or  this  information  is  not  clear,  we  will  follow  a three-stage process. First, we will consult other publications that may have used the same data set (which is frequent in prognostic studies based on large existing cohorts) (Riley 2019). Second, if we cannot  solve  the  doubt,  we  will  attempt  to  contact  the  authors for clarification. Third, if we do not clarify the issue, we will make judgments based on the available information and the consensus between  the  review  authors.  We  will  not  be  blinded  to  study authors, institution or journal of publication.   5. The  core  set  of  other  (adjustment)  prognostic  factors  that  are deemed  necessary  for  the  primary  studies  to  adjust  for  (see 'Comparator prognostic factors' and Appendix 3).   1. Study participation 2. Attrition 3. Definitions of sufficiently valid and reliable measurement of the index prognostic factors (see 'Types of prognostic factors') 4. Definitions of sufficiently valid and reliable measurement of the   As  suggested  in  Riley  2019,  we  will  define  in  advance  criteria  to assess  the  signalling  items  and  domains  for  our  specific  review question,  as  this  will  probably  facilitate  reproducibility  in  our judgements. In particular, we will use our data extraction template in  EPPI-reviewer  (Park  2018)  to  define  the  following  key  aspects, many of them already pre-defined in this protocol:   We will attempt to consider the OR and its 95% CI as the measure of  prognostic  association  in  all  the  studies.  We  have  chosen  this measure  because  we  anticipate  that  the  OR  will  be  the  most common  measure  used  in  the  primary  studies:  it  is  the  only measure  for  dichotomous  outcomes  that  can  be  estimated  from case-control studies, and OR is obtained when logistic regression is  used  to  adjust  for  confounders  (Reeves  2011).  If  results  from multivariable  analyses  in  the  primary  studies  are  reported  in another form, we will attempt to convert these to ORs at a particular time  point  (See  'Data  extraction  and  management'  above).  If  we find a study reporting a hazard ratio (HR), we will not attempt to convert the HR to OR and we will perform meta-analysis based on HRs.   outcomes (see 'Types of outcomes')   Direction of the associations   Dealing with missing data   Unit of analysis issues   The  prognostic  factor  (sex)  and  outcome  (mortality)  will  both  be considered  at  the  patient  level.  Thus,  we  do  not  anticipate  that there  will  be  unit  of  analysis  errors  (Deeks  2011).  However,  in the  case  that  we  find  any  unit  of  analysis  error  which  cannot be  handled,  we  will  meta-analyse  the  estimation,  but  take  into account  the  associated  RoB  as  part  of  the  domain  'Statistical analysis and reporting' of the RoB assessment.   We plan to include all the studies that investigated the role of sex as a prognostic factor in patients with PE regardless of the presence of missing data. We plan to contact study authors to request missing data.  For  all  the  review  outcomes  we  will  consider  the  follow-up to start after PE diagnosis. However, if the study reports only the follow-up from other time points, such as the start of the treatment or the start of the symptoms, we will use this data for the analyses.   We  acknowledge  that  the  presence  of  different  strategies  in  the included studies to handle missing participant data may introduce heterogeneity in the results. We plan to repeat the meta-analysis to assess the effect of excluding studies that did not adopt multiple imputation techniques to deal with missing values.   We will present the associations consistently, that is, associations above  one  will  indicate  a  worse  prognosis  for  women  (higher mortality). See 'Data extraction and management' for how we will recalculate associations to be in the same direction.   We will extract the adjusted measure of association for each study and prognostic effect estimate. We acknowledge that the studies providing the adjusted prognostic effect of a particular factor can differ in the set of adjustment covariates or in the cut-off used to dichotomise  the  covariates.  This  makes  the  interpretation  of  the meta-analysis challenging (Riley 2019). We agree that age, history of cancer, history of chronic cardiopulmonary disease, heart rate, systolic  blood  pressure,  and  O2  saturation  will  be  the  core  set  of adjustment factors for each review outcome.   We expect that heterogeneity between the included studies will be common  (Riley  2013).  We  plan  to  synthesise  all  the  associations found about the prognostic effect of sex with mortality outcomes in patients with PE. We do not expect to meta-analyse the prognostic within relevant subgroups. However, we will assess the presence of heterogeneity following a two-step process.   • Visual inspection of the funnel plot: we will interpret as a strong potential for small-study effects the apparent asymmetry of the funnel  plot  with  a  higher  proportion  of  smaller  studies  in  one particular direction (Riley 2019).   • Use of test for asymmetry; we will also test for asymmetry at the 10% level using the Peters' test for ORs (Peters 2006; Riley 2019; Sterne 2011).   Data synthesis   • Identification of heterogeneity   • Quantification of heterogeneity   Data synthesis and meta-analysis approaches   • there are enough studies (at least two studies); • the studies are sufficiently homogeneous:   We plan to combine the results from individual studies in a meta- analysis to provide a pooled prognostic effect estimate only if the following criteria are met:   • Interpretation  of  small-study  effects:  we  will  interpret  the presence  of  small-study  effects  with  caution  as  it  may  be  due chance, heterogeneity, publication bias and selective reporting. All  these  situations  are  frequent  in  prognosis  research  (Kyzas 2007a; Kyzas 2007b; Riley 2019) and it is difficult to disentangle them  (Riley  2019).  We  will  consider  that  small-study  effects are  caused  by  heterogeneity  rather  than  by  publication  bias if  the  smaller  studies  used  fewer  adjustment  factors  for  the analysis.  This  may  explain  why  these  small  studies  presented larger prognostic effects.   We  will  assess  the  statistical  heterogeneity  across  the  meta- analysed results considering the following factors:   We plan to meta-analyse all the studies regardless of their clinical characteristics  and  their  study  design  (as  we  plan  to  evaluate a  potential  association  and  not  causation).  However,  we  will attempt  to  use  subgroup  analyses  to  explore  possible  causes  of heterogeneity  that  are  clinical  or  methodological  (see  'Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity').   * The  Chi2  P  value:  we  will  use  the  chi-squared  test  for identifying  heterogeneity  (Chi2  P  value  <  0.10  will  be significant) (Deeks 2011).   * Visual  inspection  of  the  prognostic  effect  estimates: we  will  display  graphically  the  results  of  clinically and  methodologically  comparable  studies  with  forest plots,  and  we  will  assess  the  possibility  of  statistical heterogeneity visually.   * Use of the Tau2 and the 95% prediction interval: we will also  measure  the  heterogeneity  using  the  estimate  of between-study variance (Tau2) in a random-effects model, as  reliance  on  the  I2  statistic  in  assessing  heterogeneity may  be  misleading  (Rucker  2008).  We  will  also  report an  approximate  95%  prediction  interval  indicating  the potential  true  prognostic  effect  of  a  factor  in  a  new population (Riley 2011; Riley 2019).   * Use  of  the  I2  statistic:  the  I2  statistic  describes  the percentage  of  the  total  variation  across  studies  that  is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance) (Higgins  2003).  We  will  define  an  I2  estimate  greater than or equal to 50% and accompanied by a statistically significant  Chi2  P  value  as  evidence  of  substantial statistical heterogeneity (Chapter 9. Cochrane Handbook) (Section 9.5.2; Deeks 2011).   We  will  try  to  explain  heterogeneity  by  conducting  subgroup analyses  (if  the  number  of  studies  found  is  sufficient).  See 'Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity'.   the studies are clinically similar in terms of population and sex measurement; the  studies  are  methodologically  similar:  we  will consider  that  all  phase-2  prognostic  factor  studies  are methodologically  comparable  studies  to  determine  a prognostic  association  (independently  of  their  design). However,  we  plan  to  explore  if  the  study  design  explains heterogeneity (see subgroup analysis); the outcomes are measured at similar follow-up points; the outcomes are measured with similar measurement tools; the studies have the same type of prognostic effect estimate measure,  that  is,  an  OR  and  95%  CI  (or,  at  least,  this information can be obtained); the  prognostic  effect  estimate  has  been  adjusted  for  at least one factor (independently of the factors considered for adjustment). If a study presents the unadjusted measure only (raw data), we will not include this data for analysis.   We will not assume a common (fixed) prognostic effect of sex on mortality.  We  anticipate  that  the  prognostic  effect  estimates  will vary among studies due to several reasons, in particular, due to the presence of different study populations, designs, prognostic effect measures  (OR  and  RR),  unavailability  of  SE,  different  time  points and  measurement  of  the  outcomes,  various  sets  of  adjustment factors and due to missing data (Riley 2019). Thus, we will assume that there is not a single underlying prognostic effect to estimate and  therefore  the  heterogeneity  among  the  study  effects  cannot be  explained  by  chance  alone  and  follow  a  distribution  across studies (Deeks 2011). However, we still consider that the underlying clinical  questions  will  be  similar  enough  and  pooling  will  be meaningful  if  the  extra  uncertainty  due  to  that  heterogeneity  is adequately  represented  (Cornell  2014).  Therefore,  we  will  apply   We plan to examine the presence of 'small-study effects', that is, the presence of a systematic difference in prognostic effect estimates for small studies and large studies (Riley 2019; Sterne 2011). We will assess publication bias for each meta-analysis (if the meta-analysis includes at least ten studies) by:   Statistical model for meta-analysis   a  random-effects  model,  which  is  an  approach  for  meta-analysis that incorporates study-to-study variability beyond what would be expected by chance (Cornell 2014), and that allows for unexplained heterogeneity across studies (Riley 2019).   The  meaning  of  OR  is  difficult  to  understand  (Boissel  1999; Deeks  2011;  Sackett  1996;  Sinclair  1994).  Moreover,  ORs  tend  to be  interpreted  as  RRs  by  clinicians  (Deeks  2000).  This  can  be misleading,  as  the  OR  is  similar  to  the  RR  for  outcomes  with  a low  incidence  (<  10%),  but  the  OR  exaggerates  the  effect  when the  incidence  of  the  outcome  increases  (Zhang  1998).  This  may be the case in our review, because all-cause mortality in patients who  are  treated  for  PE  is  30%  in  high-income  countries  (Klok 2010; Ng 2011), while the PE-related mortality in patients treated for  PE  is  estimated  between  2%  and  10%  (Belohlavek  2013;  den Exter 2013; Konstantinides 2016). To facilitate interpretation of the results, we will undertake each meta-analysis based on ORs, and express  the  meta-analysis  as  an  OR.  However,  the  'Summary  of findings' table(s) will also present illustrative comparative risks and the absolute risk reductions (ARR) for the effect of the prognostic factor. To calculate the ARRs we will consider a range of different prevalences of the prognostic factor (being a female) and different risks of the outcome in the entire cohort. See 'Transformations of reported data and assumptions made' for details on the formula we will use to convert the data.   Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity   We  plan  to  investigate  if  the  following  prespecified  factors  can explain heterogeneity If there are at least two studies per subgroup:   • Assessment of clinical heterogeneity   We  plan  to  combine  results  in  a  meta-analysis  independently  of their RoB and the factors considered for adjustment. However, we will  assess  the  impact  of  this  decision  by  sensitivity  analysis.  We also  plan  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  the  statistical  model  used to  pool  data  on  the  prognostic  effect  estimate  (see  'Sensitivity analysis').   The  DerSimonian  and  Laird  (DL)  method  is  the  most  commonly used random-effects model, and is available in Review Manager 5 statistical software (Review Manager 2014). However, this method has  long  been  challenged  (Veroniki  2019)  because  it  produces  a 95%  CI  that  is  too  narrow  (and  P  values  that  are  typically  too small)  under  two  circumstances  that  this  review  will  probably meet: a small number of studies and the presence of substantive differences  among  study  estimates  (Cornell  2014;  Riley  2019). Therefore,  we  plan  to  use  the  Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) method for random effects meta-analysis, as it has shown to  consistently  result  in  more  adequate  error  rates  than  the  DL method, especially when the number of studies is small (IntHout 2014). However, we will take into consideration that even with the HKSJ  method,  extra  caution  is  needed  when  there  are  less  than six  studies  of  very  unequal  sizes  (IntHout  2014).  We  plan  to  use the Cochrane Review Manager 5 software (Review Manager 2014) for  organising  the  text  of  the  review.  We  will  use  the  'metareg' command  in  Stata  to  perform  the  meta-analysis  with  the  HKSJ method (Harbord 2008).   If  we  find  relevant  unexplained  statistical  heterogeneity,  we  will still  meta-analyse  the  data,  but  we  will  downgrade  the  certainty of the prognostic effect estimate as part of the GRADE assessment (see  below).  If  we  detect  that  the  meta-analysis  is  inappropriate for  other  reasons,  we  will  not  combine  results.  However,  we  will undertake  a  narrative  analysis  of  studies,  providing  a  descriptive presentation of results with supporting tables.   For the meta-analysis of each prognostic effect estimate we plan to provide the pooled estimate based on the random-effects approach (the average prognostic effect of sex), its Hartung-Knapp 95% CI, the I2, the estimate of Tau2 (between-study variance) and the 95% prediction interval for the prognostic effect in a single population, as done in Westby 2018 and suggested in Riley 2011 and Riley 2019.   If  there  are  enough  studies,  we  will  follow  the  guidance  in  Riley 2019, which states that if restricting the analysis to the subset of studies at low RoB resolves previous issues of small-study effects, then it gives even more credence to focus conclusions on the meta- analysis results based only on the studies with low risk of bias.   managed at the outpatient setting   versus case control studies   by the study authors)   moderate RoB   regions   studies   * Setting:  patients  managed  at  the  hospital  versus  patients   * Measurement of the prognostic factor (sex): measured at the start of PE diagnosis versus measured at the start of PE treatment   * Treated  for  PE:  participants  treated   for  PE  versus participants not treated for PE. It is estimated that in Europe around  30%  of  PE-related  deaths  occur  before  receiving any  treatment  for  PE  (Belohlavek  2013).  Moreover,  these numbers  can  be  even  higher  in  low  resource  settings (Wendelboe 2016)   * Reperfusion  treatment  for  PE:  patients  who  received reperfusion  treatment  for  PE  (thrombolysis  or  surgical embolectomy) versus patients who did not   * Haemodynamic  status:  stable  versus  unstable  (as  defined   * Geographic region: Europe and North America versus other   • Assessment of methodological heterogeneity   * Study  design:  experimental  studies  versus  cohort  studies   * Mean participants' age: less than 45 years versus older than   * Risk of bias: studies with high RoB versus studies with low or   * Study  design:  experimental  studies  versus  observational   An  OR  larger  than  one  will  suggest  that  female  sex  is  associated with  higher  odds  of  mortality.  For  relative  effects,  we  will  define the clinical importance of the observed prognostic associations as follows: small: OR < 1.2; moderate: OR between 1.2 and 2; large: OR > 2. For absolute risk differences, we will consider an absolute risk of 5% (50 per 1000) as the threshold for identifying an important prognostic factor.   Sensitivity analysis   We plan to undertake the following sensitivity analysis if there are sufficient studies.   • We will repeat the meta-analysis to assess the effect of including   only studies with prospective assessment of outcomes.   • We will repeat the meta-analysis to assess the effect of including   only observational studies.   these  restrictions  as  part  of  the  assessment  of  indirectness  with GRADE.   We  will  not  consider  the  phase  of  investigation  of  studies  in  our assessment of the strength of the evidence available, as only phase 2 studies will be eligible.   We will use GRADEproGDT software (GRADEpro-GDT 2015) to create 'Summary of findings' tables with the main results of the review, including  the  certainty  of  the  body  of  evidence  related  to  each outcome. All the review outcomes are critical for decision making, so  they  will  be  included  in  the  table.  The  'Summary  of  findings' table will contain all decisions to down- or upgrade the certainty of the evidence with footnotes, and provide explanations to help the  reader's  understanding  of  the  review  where  necessary.  Two review authors (JLA, ES) will assess the certainty of the evidence found for each outcomes. Another review author (AM) will check the assessments. We have included a template 'Summary of findings' table  in  Table  2.  We  will  create  one  table  for  each  of  the  main comparisons of the review (if there are more than one).   • We will repeat the meta-analysis to assess the effect of excluding the studies that the Index prognostic factor (sex) was measured at the start of PE treatment (instead of diagnosis).   • We  will  repeat  the  meta-analysis  to  assess  the  effect  of excluding  studies  that  have  used  routinely  collected  hospital administrative databases.   • We  will  repeat  the  meta-analysis  to  assess  the  effect  of excluding studies that have adjusted for PESI (or PESI simplified) measured as a categorical variable.   • We will repeat the meta-analysis to assess the effect of excluding   studies with high RoB.   • We will repeat the meta-analysis to assess the effect of excluding studies that have provided an adjusted estimate but that did not adjust for all our core set of covariates.   • We will repeat the meta-analysis to assess the effect of excluding studies  that  did  not  adopt  multiple  imputation  techniques  to deal with missing participant data.   • We will repeat the meta-analysis to assess the effect of using a   fixed-effect model.   • We will repeat the meta-analysis based on the DL method.   We  will  assess  the  certainty  of  the  body  of  evidence  for  each prognostic  effect  estimation  according  to  the  recommendations of  the  Grading  of  Recommendations  Assessment,  Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group (GRADE 2013). We will use the adapted GRADE approach for questions on prognostic factors (Foroutan  2020;  Huguet  2013;  Iorio  2015;  Westby  2018).  GRADE initially considers evidence from phase 2 studies as high certainty. However, this initial certainty of evidence can be modified, based on the following criteria:   A U T H O R S '   C O N C L U S I O N S   We  will  consider  that  the  best  evidence  regarding  a  prognostic factor normally comes from observational studies (cohort studies, registries,  or  database  linkage  studies).  Thus,  we  will  provide  an initial  high-certainty  rating  to  the  body  of  the  evidence  based on  these  studies  (Foroutan  2020;  Iorio  2015).  On  the  other  hand, the  certainty  of  the  evidence  for  secondary  analyses  of  RCTs  will be probably  lower due to the presence of restrictions of patients relevant for our review questions (Foroutan 2020). We will assess   • Criteria  for  downgrading  confidence  in  the  prognostic  effect estimate:  RoB,  inconsistency,  imprecision,  indirectness  and publication bias   • Criteria  for  upgrading  confidence  in  the  prognostic  effect   estimate: large effect   We  would  like  to  thank  the  Cochrane  Prognostic  Methods  group, particularly  Karl  Moons,  Lotty  Hooft  and  Thomas  Debray,  for  the support and guidance in the methodology and for the deliverance of  a  course  on  carrying  out  prognostic  systematic  reviews  at  the Cochrane Associate Centre of Madrid (June 2018).

         "BACKGROUND\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off-label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high-income countries where on-label disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are available. This updates the 2021 version of the review.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the benefits and harms of rituximab as 'first choice' and 'switching' treatment for adults with any form of MS.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and three trials registers on 31 December 2023, together with reference checking and contacting study authors to identify unpublished studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with any form of MS.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe followed standard Cochrane methods. We used RoB 1 to assess risk of bias in RCTs and ROBINS-I in NRSIs. We assessed the certainty of evidence for critical and important prioritised outcomes using GRADE: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching' treatment, relapsing or progressive MS, comparison with placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nIn this update, the number of study participants increased from 16,429 (15 studies) to 37,443 (28 studies; 13 new studies: 1 RCT and 12 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high-income countries (25 studies). Public institutions funded 22 (79%) of the studies. Most studies investigated the effects of rituximab on people with relapsing MS (19 studies; 27,500 (73%) participants). We identified 12 ongoing studies. Rituximab as 'first choice' for active relapsing MS None of the included studies compared rituximab to placebo. One RCT compared rituximab to dimethyl fumarate, with 24 months' follow-up. Rituximab may reduce the recurrence of relapse (odds ratio (OR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.57; 195 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on disability worsening and SAEs. Rituximab may result in little to no difference in upper respiratory tract infections (rate ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for urinary tract, skin, and viral infections. HRQoL, cancer, and mortality were not reported. One NRSI compared rituximab to other DMTs, with 24 months' follow-up. Disability worsening was not reported. Compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, rituximab likely delays relapse (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.39; 1 study, 335 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, rituximab may delay relapse (dimethyl fumarate: HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; 1 study, 206 participants; low-certainty evidence; natalizumab: HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.00; 1 study, 170 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence for relapse is very uncertain when comparing rituximab to fingolimod. The effect on SAEs is uncertain due to very few events in all the comparison groups. No deaths were reported. HRQoL, common infections, and cancer were not reported. Rituximab as 'first choice' for primary progressive MS One RCT compared rituximab to placebo, with 24 months' follow-up. Rituximab likely results in little or no difference in disability worsening (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11; 439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on relapse, SAEs, common infections, cancer, and mortality. HRQoL was not reported. None of the included studies compared rituximab as 'first choice' treatment to other DMTs for primary or secondary progressive MS. Rituximab as 'switching' treatment for relapsing MS One small RCT compared rituximab to placebo, with 12 months' follow-up. Disability worsening was not reported. Rituximab may reduce recurrence of relapses (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93; 1 study, 104 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain regarding SAEs, common infections, cancer, and mortality. HRQoL was not reported. Twelve NRSIs compared rituximab to other DMTs, with 24 months' follow-up. The evidence on disability worsening is very uncertain in comparison with interferons or glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and ocrelizumab. Rituximab likely delays time to relapse in comparison with interferons or glatiramer acetate (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 1 study, 1383 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fingolimod (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 study, 256 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may result in little or no difference compared with natalizumab (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; 3 studies, 1922 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on relapse in comparison with alemtuzumab. There is uncertainty regarding SAEs when comparing rituximab to natalizumab and fingolimod. Rituximab likely increases serious common infections when compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.62; 1 study, 5477 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and natalizumab (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.32; 2 studies, 5001 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence for common infections is very uncertain when comparing rituximab to fingolimod and ocrelizumab. Rituximab may slightly reduce the risk of cancer compared with natalizumab (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99; 2 studies, 6202 participants; low-certainty evidence), whereas the evidence is very uncertain in comparison with fingolimod. The effect of rituximab on mortality is very uncertain due to very few events in all the comparison groups. HRQoL was not reported.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nFor preventing relapses in relapsing MS, rituximab as 'first choice' and 'switching' treatment compares favourably with a wide range of approved DMTs. The protective effect of rituximab against disability worsening is uncertain. There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab on primary progressive MS. There is limited evidence for long-term adverse events of rituximab in people with MS. Evidence for serious adverse events, cancer, and mortality was of very low certainty due to few events. There is an increased risk of serious (hospital-treated) infections with rituximab compared with other DMTs, although the absolute risk is low. High-quality (prospectively registered) NRSIs should be conducted to draw more reliable conclusions about the potential benefits and harms of rituximab in people with MS.",

Clinically,  it  is\ncharacterised by recurrent relapses and disability worsening. The\nclinical course is classified as relapsing MS, secondary progressive\nMS, and primary progressive MS (Lublin 1996). These forms of MS\nwere  used  to  design  trials  of  interventions  over  two  decades.  An\nupdated classification of MS forms was produced in 2013 (Lublin\n2014).  The  concept  of  disease  activity  was  added,  based  on  the\npresence  of  clinical  relapse  or  new  magnetic  resonance  imaging\n(MRI) lesions in the brain. The new classification included: 1. active\nor inactive relapsing MS, with or without worsening; and 2. active or\ninactive primary or secondary progressive disease, with or without\nprogression (Lublin 2014). Worldwide, 85% of people with MS are\ninitially  diagnosed  with  relapsing  MS  and  12%  with  progressive\nMS.  The  remaining  3%  are  given  an  unknown  disease  type  on\ndiagnosis (MSIF 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nRituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of\nadults with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic\nleukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis,\n(FDA\nmicroscopic  polyarteritis,  and  pemphigus  vulgaris\n2020a).

Progressive  multifocal\nleukoencephalopathy  (PML),  a  rare  but  serious  brain  infection\ncaused  by  a  virus,  can  occur  in  rituximab-treated  people  with\nhaematological malignancies or other autoimmune diseases. Most\npeople  with  haematological  malignancies  diagnosed  with  PML\nreceived rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part\nof  a  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  (FDA  2020a).  People\nwith  autoimmune  diseases  diagnosed  with  PML  had  prior  or\nconcurrent immunosuppressive therapy (Berger 2018; FDA 2020a).\nMost  cases  of  PML  were  diagnosed  within  12  months  of  their\nlast  infusion  of  rituximab  (FDA  2020a).  Rituximab  is  listed  as\nhaving  \"no  or  very  low  risk  for  PML\"  by  Yukitake  2018.  Cardiac\nand vascular events (hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias, and\nangina)  have  been  reported  with  rituximab  (FDA  2020a).  Two\nregistry  studies  in  Sweden  showed  no  evidence  of  an  increased\nrisk  of  cancer  with  rituximab  use  in  3585  people  with  rheumatic\ndisease  (Wadstrom  2017),  and  in  4187  people  with  MS  (Alping\n2020). However, the results of one observational study showed an\nassociation between malignant melanoma and breast cancer with\nrituximab use (Caldito 2021).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ntreatments\n(DMTs)  have  been\nSeveral  disease-modifying\ndiscovered  and  approved\nfor  people  with  relapsing  MS.\nInfused  approved  DMTs  include:  alemtuzumab,  mitoxantrone,\nnatalizumab, and ocrelizumab.

Common to all guidelines is a moderate\nor low level of evidence available to assign strength to treatment\nrecommendations, because there are few randomised studies that\ndirectly  compared  different  DMTs  as  'first  choice'  treatment  or\nas  'switching'.  Recommendations  on  the  use  of  rituximab  vary\namong guidelines, reflecting – among other things – the differences\nin  regulatory  agencies'  recommendations  and  different  regional\nor  local  health  policies.  For  example,  the  use  of  rituximab  has\nincreased rapidly within Sweden for treating relapsing MS, since,\nunder  existing  Swedish  free  right  to  prescription  provisions,  the\ntreating hospital assumes responsibility and liabilities associated\nwith off-label use of rituximab (Spelman 2018). The data from the\nnational  Swedish  MS  Registry  showed  an  increasing  prescription\nrate  of  rituximab  in  relation  to  other  DMTs  during  the  years\n2011  to  2016.  In  June  2017,  the  proportion  of  people  with  MS\nstarting  rituximab  as  'first  choice'  treatment  was  more  than\n50% (Berntsson 2018). Rituximab is recommended by the Middle\nEast  and  North  Africa  Committee  (MENACTRIMS)  Consensus  as\nan  off-label  treatment  for  highly  active  MS  and  as  an  escalation\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nRituximab for people with multiple sclerosis (Review)\nCopyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The European guideline does not include\nrecommendations  on  the  use  of  rituximab,  as  regulations  on\nthis treatment vary broadly between different European countries\n(Montalban 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe inflammation in the central nervous system in MS stems from\ncomplex interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells,\nsuch as B cells and myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and\nmicroglia) (Comi 2021; Zhong 2020). The pro-inflammatory role of\nB cells in MS involves antigen presentation to activate pathogenic T\ncells and macrophages, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,\nand  formation  and  maintenance  of  ectopic  lymphoid  organs\nin  the  central  nervous  system  (Greenfield  2018;  Hauser  2015;\nSabatino  2019).  B  cells  are  highly  selective  for  antigens  bound\nto  their  cell  receptor  (BCR)  (Greenfield  2018).  The  antigen–BCR\ncomplex is internalised and processed, its constituent peptides are\nthen complexed with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)\nclass II molecules, and the antigen–MHC complex is transported to\nthe  cell  surface  where  it  can  activate  T  cells  (Th1  and  Th17)  by\ninvolvement  of  the  T  cell  receptor  and  costimulatory  molecules\n(Batista 2009). In MS, priming of T cells is caused by autoreactive B\ncells that demonstrate higher levels of antigen-presenting activity\ncompared  to  B  cells  of  healthy  controls  or  individuals  with\nother  neuroinflammatory  diseases  (Jelcic  2018;  Mathias  2017).\nThe  binding  of  autoantigen  to  BCR  also  causes  aberrant  B  cells\nto produce pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. B cells of\npeople with MS cultured in vitro have been found to secrete higher\nlevels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower levels of regulatory\ncytokines  (Bar-Or  2010;  Duddy  2007).  In  the  milieu  of  pro-\ninflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and lymphotoxin signalling,\nB  cells  support  the  development  of  ectopic  B-cell  follicles  that\nhave  been  detected  in  the  meninges  of  people  with  secondary\nprogressive MS (Serafini 2004).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nRituximab  binds  selectively  to  the  CD20  antigen  expressed  on\nthe  surface  of  pre-B  cells,  mature  and  memory  B  cells,  and\nsome  plasmablasts,  but  not  B-cell  progenitors  (pro-B  cells)\nand  differentiated  plasma  cells  (i.e.  B  cells  that  do  not  express\nCD20)  (Greenfield  2018;  St  Clair  2010).  Therefore,  administration\nof  rituximab  causes  selective  loss  of  circulating  and  tissue-\nbased  B  cells  that  are  responsible  for  antigen  presentation\nand  cytokine  production,  without  affecting  B-cell  reconstitution\nor  pre-existing  humoral  immunity.  Mechanisms  of  B-cell  lysis\ninclude  primarily  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  but\nalso  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  (Greenfield\n2018). Other modes of action of rituximab have been proposed (e.g.\ndepletion of CD20 cells or Epstein-Barr herpesvirus (EBV) reservoir\ndepletion) (Ineichen 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nRituximab  was  detectable  in  the  serum  of  people  three  to  six\nmonths  after  completion  of  treatment  (FDA  2020a).  Following\nintravenous  administration  of  rituximab,  B  lymphocytes  typically\nremain  depleted  in  peripheral  blood  for  six  to  nine  months\n(Greenfield  2018;  Roll  2006).  In  non-blood  tissues,  including  the\ncentral nervous system, the extent and duration of depletion is not\nfully known but is likely to be partial, to depend on the dose, and\nto be modulated by individual factors such as genetic background\n(Greenfield 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nWhy it is important to do this review\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe off-label use of rituximab to treat MS has been reported in most\ncountries (70 of the 102 countries reported in the Multiple Sclerosis\nInternational  Federation's  (MSIF)  Atlas  of  MS)  (Laurson-Doube\n2021).  Several  published  observational  data  have  strengthened\nthe  evidence  for  effectiveness  and  safety  of  rituximab  in  MS,\nand  reported  a  discontinuation  rate  that  was  lower  than  that  of\nother  DMTs  (Granqvist  2018;  Salzer  2016).  The  identification  of\nbeneficial and adverse effects of rituximab for both relapsing MS\nand  progressive  forms  of  MS,  including  switching  drug  regimens,\nincreases  the  importance  of  this  review  mainly  for  low-  and\nmedium-income countries.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nGiven  that  the  period  of  patent  protection  has  expired,  it  is\nextremely  unlikely  that  a  registration  trial  of  rituximab  for  MS\nwill ever been undertaken. Therefore, evidence on beneficial and\nadverse  effects  of  rituximab  for  MS  will  not  be  provided  by\nrandomised  trials.  Considering  that  rituximab  is  widely  used  as\noff-label  treatment  in  people  with  MS,  we  have  a  duty  to  people\nwith MS, practitioners, and policymakers to provide these groups\nwith a summary of available evidence that includes controlled non-\nrandomised studies (Reeves 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOcrelizumab  and  ofatumumab,  which  are  anti-CD20  monoclonal\nantibodies similar to rituximab, have been approved as treatments\nfor  relapsing  and  active  progressive  forms  of  MS,  but  these\nmedicines  are  not  available  in  low-income  countries  due  to\nprohibitive costs. Rituximab is a relatively inexpensive treatment,\ncheaper than any other approved DMTs for MS, and it is a feasible\noption in resource-limited settings (Mathew 2020). With increasing\nincidence  and  prevalence  of  MS  globally,  especially  in  low-  and\nmiddle-income countries, it is essential to ensure that people with\nMS  have  timely  access  to  safe  and  effective  treatments  (Lancet\nNeurology 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe  considered  that  a  new  review  was  more  appropriate,\nrather  than  updating  the  previous  Cochrane  Review  (He  2013),\nbecause  changes  to  the  review  methods  were  substantive.  We\ndecided  to  add  non-randomised  studies  to  the  review  that  was\npreviously  restricted  to  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  to\nwiden the evidence base, making use of the Risk Of Bias in Non-\nrandomised  Studies  –  of  Interventions  tool  (ROBINS-I)  in  critical\nevaluation  of  the  validity  of  non-randomised  studies.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off-label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high-income countries where on-label disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are available.   To assess beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' for adults with MS.   We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registers for completed and ongoing studies on 31 January 2021.   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with MS.   We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE for: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching', relapsing or progressive MS, comparison versus placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs.   We included 15 studies (5 RCTs, 10 NRSIs) with 16,429 participants of whom 13,143 were relapsing MS and 3286 progressive MS. The studies were one to two years long and compared rituximab as 'first choice' with placebo (1 RCT) or other DMTs (1 NRSI), rituximab as 'switching' against  placebo  (2  RCTs)  or  other  DMTs  (2  RCTs,  9  NRSIs).  The  studies  were  conducted  worldwide;  most  originated  from  high-income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two studies. We identified 14 ongoing studies.   Rituximab versus placebo: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.   Rituximab versus other DMTs: one NRSI compared rituximab with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, or fingolimod in active relapsing MS at 24 months' follow-up. Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.39; 335 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Rituximab may reduce relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence) and natalizumab (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.00; 170 participants; low-certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference on relapse compared with fingolimod (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.69; 137 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported no deaths over 24 months. The study did not measure disability worsening, SAEs, HRQoL, and common infections.   One  RCT  compared  rituximab  with  placebo  in  primary  progressive  MS  at  24  months'  follow-up.  Rituximab  likely  results  in  little  to  no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11; 439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Rituximab may result in little to no difference in recurrence of relapses (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.99; 439 participants; low-certainty evidence), SAEs (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; 439 participants; low-certainty evidence), common infections (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.73; 439 participants; low-certainty evidence), cancer (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.59; 439 participants; low-certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.77; 439 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study did not measure HRQoL.   Rituximab versus other DMTs: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.   One  RCT  compared  rituximab  with  placebo  in  relapsing  MS  at  12  months'  follow-up.  Rituximab  may  decrease  recurrence  of  relapses compared with placebo (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93; 104 participants; low-certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to placebo on SAEs (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.92; 104 participants; very low-certainty evidence), common infections (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.24; 104 participants; very low-certainty evidence), cancer (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not measure disability worsening and HRQoL.   Five NRSIs compared rituximab with other DMTs in relapsing MS at 24 months' follow-up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate on disability worsening (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.42; 1 NRSI, 853 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 1 NRSI, 1383 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and fingolimod (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 NRSI, 256 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to natalizumab on relapses (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.0; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Rituximab likely increases slightly common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.62; 1 NRSI, 5477 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and compared with natalizumab (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.32; 2 NRSIs, 5001 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Rituximab may increase slightly common infections compared with fingolimod (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.77; 3 NRSIs, 5187 participants; low-certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference compared with ocrelizumab (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.40; 1 NRSI, 472 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab on mortality compared with fingolimod (OR 5.59, 95% CI 0.22 to 139.89; 1 NRSI, 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and natalizumab (OR 6.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 166.58; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The included studies did not measure SAEs, HRQoL, and cancer.   For preventing relapses in relapsing MS, rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' may compare favourably with a wide range of approved DMTs. A protective effect of rituximab against disability worsening is uncertain. There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive MS.   The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on SAEs. They are relatively rare in people with MS, thus difficult to study, and they were not well reported in studies. There is an increased risk of common infections with rituximab, but absolute risk is small.   Rituximab is widely used as off-label treatment in people with MS; however, randomised evidence is weak. In the absence of randomised evidence,  remaining  uncertainties  on  beneficial  and  adverse  effects  of  rituximab  for  MS  might  be  clarified  by  making  real-world  data available.   P L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y   – Rituximab may offer moderate-to-large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Compared with no medicines, the desirable effects would be greater.   – There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for preventing disability worsening in all forms of MS.   – Serious harmful effects are relatively rare in people with MS making them difficult to study, and they were also not well reported in studies.   Rituximab is a medicine administered by intravenous (by a vein) infusion that can suppress certain immune cells. The immune system fights infections and consists of many immune cells; it is affected in MS.   Rituximab is currently used in many low- to middle-income countries that have major barriers for accessing approved medicines for MS. However, rituximab is not always reimbursed by health systems because it is not licensed for MS by marketing authorities.   Rituximab is considered a feasible treatment option as it is considered a highly effective treatment (similar to other approved medicines used to treat MS) but has considerably lower cost and less frequent dosing. Treatment with rituximab requires specialist care and infusion facilities, but other approved medicines do too.   We  aimed  to  investigate  the  beneficial  and  unwanted  effects  of  rituximab  for  people  with  MS,  when  is  used  as  a  'first  choice'  or  as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated).   We wanted to find out if rituximab was better than other medicines to prevent disability worsening and recurrence of relapse, and to improve well-being.   We also wanted to find out if rituximab was associated with any unwanted or harmful effects, for example, serious harmful effects, common infections, cancer, and mortality (death).   We searched for studies that investigated rituximab compared with all other approved medicines for MS. We searched the literature up to January 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and quality.   We found 15 studies that involved about 16,000 people with MS and lasted one or two years. The biggest study was of 6421 people and the smallest study was of 27 people. The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high-income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two included studies.   –  likely  results  in  a  large  reduction  in  the  number  of  people  who  have  relapses  compared  with  interferon  beta  or  glatiramer  acetate (evidence from one study in 335 people);   – may reduce the number of people who have relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, but the evidence is uncertain (evidence from one study).   There was no usable information on disability worsening, well-being, and serious harmful effects.   – likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening over 24 months compared with pretend treatment (evidence from one study of 439 people);   – the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of rituximab on well-being and serious harmful effects.   –  likely  results  in  a  large  reduction  in  the  number  of  people  who  have  relapses  compared  with  interferon  beta  or  glatiramer  acetate (evidence from one study of 1383 people), and fingolimod (evidence from one study of 256 people). The evidence is very uncertain on the comparison of rituximab with natalizumab;   – likely increases slightly the number of people who have common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 5477 people), and natalizumab (evidence from two studies of 5001 people). The evidence is uncertain for the comparisons of rituximab with fingolimod and ocrelizumab.   There was no usable information on well-being and serious harmful effects.   Only three small studies investigated rituximab in secondary progressive MS. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening, well-being, and serious harmful effects.   – Limited confidence about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening in all forms of MS.   – Limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive forms of MS.   – Studies were short with a median duration of 24 months.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system. The global prevalence of MS is estimated at 36 per 100,000 people, which means there are 2.8 million adults living with MS worldwide. MS is present in all regions of the world, but  prevalence  is  noticeably  higher  in  Europe  and  the  Americas. There are at least twice as many females (69%) with MS as there are males (31%). MS can occur at any age, but the mean age at which MS  is  diagnosed  is  from  30  to  33  years.  MS  is  the  most  common neurological cause of disability for young adults (MSIF 2020).   characterised   pathologically   inflammation, MS demyelination,  and  axonal  and  neuronal  loss.  Clinically,  it  is characterised by recurrent relapses and disability worsening. The clinical course is classified as relapsing MS, secondary progressive MS, and primary progressive MS (Lublin 1996). These forms of MS were  used  to  design  trials  of  interventions  over  two  decades.  An updated classification of MS forms was produced in 2013 (Lublin 2014).  The  concept  of  disease  activity  was  added,  based  on  the presence  of  clinical  relapse  or  new  magnetic  resonance  imaging (MRI) lesions in the brain. The new classification included: 1. active or inactive relapsing MS, with or without worsening; and 2. active or inactive primary or secondary progressive disease, with or without progression (Lublin 2014). Worldwide, 85% of people with MS are initially  diagnosed  with  relapsing  MS  and  12%  with  progressive MS.  The  remaining  3%  are  given  an  unknown  disease  type  on diagnosis (MSIF 2020).   Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of adults with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, (FDA microscopic  polyarteritis,  and  pemphigus  vulgaris 2020a).  Neurologists  have  used to 2016),  myasthenia treat  neuromyelitis  optica gravis  (Banerjee  2018),  autoimmune  encephalitis  (Nepal  2020), autoimmune  neuropathies  and  myopathies  (Fasano  2017),  and MS  (European  Commission  2017;  Sarsour  2020).  This  drug  is marketed  by  Genentech-Biogen  in  the  US  under  the  brand  name Rituxan, and by Roche in Europe under the brand name MabThera.   rituximab  off-label   Rituximab is administered by intravenous infusion at single doses of  500  mg  or  1000  mg,  two  weeks  apart.  The  maintenance  dose is  500  mg  or  1000  mg  every  six  to  12  months.  The  alternative induction  dose,  or  in  cases  of  disease  breakthrough,  is  375  mg/ m2  every  week  for  four  weeks.  However,  a  treatment  protocol has  not  yet  been  established;  induction  and  maintenance  doses may  change  based  on  the  type  of  MS,  MRI  lesion  load,  clinical response,  and  CD19-positive  or  CD20-positive  cell  counts.  The summary  of  product  characteristics  states  that  rituximab  should be  administered  under  the  close  supervision  of  an  experienced physician. Serum rituximab's half-life is reported to be 76.3 hours (Maloney 1997).   The most frequently observed short-term adverse events in people receiving rituximab are infusion-related reactions (FDA 2020a). The majority of these reactions occur during the first infusion or within 24 hours of the infusion. The final report of the Rheumatoid Arthritis Global  Clinical  Trial  Program,  based  on  over  11  years'  follow-   up,  reported  that  rituximab  remained  well  tolerated  over  time and for multiple courses (van Vollenhoven 2015). Under long-term therapy  with  rituximab  or  other  B-cell-depleting  drugs,  and  with alternative  immunomodulatory  agents  for  MS,  immunoglobulin deficiency  syndromes  can  occur  that  may  be  associated  with severe  infections  (Hallberg  2019;  Luna  2020;  Tsao  2019;  van Vollenhoven  2015).  Hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  reactivation  following chemotherapy  that  includes  rituximab  has  been  reported  in people  who  have  either  had  hepatitis  B  or  are  a  carrier of  HBV  (Evens  2011;  Pourcher  2020).  Progressive  multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML),  a  rare  but  serious  brain  infection caused  by  a  virus,  can  occur  in  rituximab-treated  people  with haematological malignancies or other autoimmune diseases. Most people  with  haematological  malignancies  diagnosed  with  PML received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of  a  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  (FDA  2020a).  People with  autoimmune  diseases  diagnosed  with  PML  had  prior  or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy (Berger 2018; FDA 2020a). Most  cases  of  PML  were  diagnosed  within  12  months  of  their last  infusion  of  rituximab  (FDA  2020a).  Rituximab  is  listed  as having  \"no  or  very  low  risk  for  PML\"  by  Yukitake  2018.  Cardiac and vascular events (hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias, and angina)  have  been  reported  with  rituximab  (FDA  2020a).  Two registry  studies  in  Sweden  showed  no  evidence  of  an  increased risk  of  cancer  with  rituximab  use  in  3585  people  with  rheumatic disease  (Wadstrom  2017),  and  in  4187  people  with  MS  (Alping 2020). However, the results of one observational study showed an association between malignant melanoma and breast cancer with rituximab use (Caldito 2021).   treatments (DMTs)  have  been Several  disease-modifying discovered  and  approved for  people  with  relapsing  MS. Infused  approved  DMTs  include:  alemtuzumab,  mitoxantrone, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab. Injectable approved DMTs include: interferon  betas,  glatiramer  acetate,  peginterferon  beta-1a,  and ofatumumab.  Oral  approved  DMTs  include:  cladribine,  dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, fingolimod, monomethyl fumarate, ozanimod,  siponimod,  and  teriflunomide.  Recently  the  US  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved siponimod (FDA 2019a), ozanimod  (FDA  2020b),  and  cladribine  (FDA  2019b)  for  active secondary progressive MS.   Several national and international guidelines on the use of DMTs for MS are available (Table 1). Common to all guidelines is a moderate or low level of evidence available to assign strength to treatment recommendations, because there are few randomised studies that directly  compared  different  DMTs  as  'first  choice'  treatment  or as  'switching'.  Recommendations  on  the  use  of  rituximab  vary among guidelines, reflecting – among other things – the differences in  regulatory  agencies'  recommendations  and  different  regional or  local  health  policies.  For  example,  the  use  of  rituximab  has increased rapidly within Sweden for treating relapsing MS, since, under  existing  Swedish  free  right  to  prescription  provisions,  the treating hospital assumes responsibility and liabilities associated with off-label use of rituximab (Spelman 2018). The data from the national  Swedish  MS  Registry  showed  an  increasing  prescription rate  of  rituximab  in  relation  to  other  DMTs  during  the  years 2011  to  2016.  In  June  2017,  the  proportion  of  people  with  MS starting  rituximab  as  'first  choice'  treatment  was  more  than 50% (Berntsson 2018). Rituximab is recommended by the Middle East  and  North  Africa  Committee  (MENACTRIMS)  Consensus  as an  off-label  treatment  for  highly  active  MS  and  as  an  escalation   therapy for all levels of MS activity in special populations, such as refugees, or in countries where other appropriate options are not available (Yamout 2020). The European guideline does not include recommendations  on  the  use  of  rituximab,  as  regulations  on this treatment vary broadly between different European countries (Montalban 2018).   The inflammation in the central nervous system in MS stems from complex interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, such as B cells and myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia) (Comi 2021; Zhong 2020). The pro-inflammatory role of B cells in MS involves antigen presentation to activate pathogenic T cells and macrophages, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and  formation  and  maintenance  of  ectopic  lymphoid  organs in  the  central  nervous  system  (Greenfield  2018;  Hauser  2015; Sabatino  2019).  B  cells  are  highly  selective  for  antigens  bound to  their  cell  receptor  (BCR)  (Greenfield  2018).  The  antigen–BCR complex is internalised and processed, its constituent peptides are then complexed with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, and the antigen–MHC complex is transported to the  cell  surface  where  it  can  activate  T  cells  (Th1  and  Th17)  by involvement  of  the  T  cell  receptor  and  costimulatory  molecules (Batista 2009). In MS, priming of T cells is caused by autoreactive B cells that demonstrate higher levels of antigen-presenting activity compared  to  B  cells  of  healthy  controls  or  individuals  with other  neuroinflammatory  diseases  (Jelcic  2018;  Mathias  2017). The  binding  of  autoantigen  to  BCR  also  causes  aberrant  B  cells to produce pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. B cells of people with MS cultured in vitro have been found to secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower levels of regulatory cytokines  (Bar-Or  2010;  Duddy  2007).  In  the  milieu  of  pro- inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and lymphotoxin signalling, B  cells  support  the  development  of  ectopic  B-cell  follicles  that have  been  detected  in  the  meninges  of  people  with  secondary progressive MS (Serafini 2004).   Rituximab  binds  selectively  to  the  CD20  antigen  expressed  on the  surface  of  pre-B  cells,  mature  and  memory  B  cells,  and some  plasmablasts,  but  not  B-cell  progenitors  (pro-B  cells) and  differentiated  plasma  cells  (i.e.  B  cells  that  do  not  express CD20)  (Greenfield  2018;  St  Clair  2010).  Therefore,  administration of  rituximab  causes  selective  loss  of  circulating  and  tissue- based  B  cells  that  are  responsible  for  antigen  presentation and  cytokine  production,  without  affecting  B-cell  reconstitution or  pre-existing  humoral  immunity.  Mechanisms  of  B-cell  lysis include  primarily  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  but also  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  (Greenfield 2018). Other modes of action of rituximab have been proposed (e.g. depletion of CD20 cells or Epstein-Barr herpesvirus (EBV) reservoir depletion) (Ineichen 2020).   Rituximab  was  detectable  in  the  serum  of  people  three  to  six months  after  completion  of  treatment  (FDA  2020a).  Following intravenous  administration  of  rituximab,  B  lymphocytes  typically remain  depleted  in  peripheral  blood  for  six  to  nine  months (Greenfield  2018;  Roll  2006).  In  non-blood  tissues,  including  the central nervous system, the extent and duration of depletion is not fully known but is likely to be partial, to depend on the dose, and to be modulated by individual factors such as genetic background (Greenfield 2018).   Why it is important to do this review   The off-label use of rituximab to treat MS has been reported in most countries (70 of the 102 countries reported in the Multiple Sclerosis International  Federation's  (MSIF)  Atlas  of  MS)  (Laurson-Doube 2021).  Several  published  observational  data  have  strengthened the  evidence  for  effectiveness  and  safety  of  rituximab  in  MS, and  reported  a  discontinuation  rate  that  was  lower  than  that  of other  DMTs  (Granqvist  2018;  Salzer  2016).  The  identification  of beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab for both relapsing MS and  progressive  forms  of  MS,  including  switching  drug  regimens, increases  the  importance  of  this  review  mainly  for  low-  and medium-income countries.   Given  that  the  period  of  patent  protection  has  expired,  it  is extremely  unlikely  that  a  registration  trial  of  rituximab  for  MS will ever been undertaken. Therefore, evidence on beneficial and adverse  effects  of  rituximab  for  MS  will  not  be  provided  by randomised  trials.  Considering  that  rituximab  is  widely  used  as off-label  treatment  in  people  with  MS,  we  have  a  duty  to  people with MS, practitioners, and policymakers to provide these groups with a summary of available evidence that includes controlled non- randomised studies (Reeves 2019).   Ocrelizumab  and  ofatumumab,  which  are  anti-CD20  monoclonal antibodies similar to rituximab, have been approved as treatments for  relapsing  and  active  progressive  forms  of  MS,  but  these medicines  are  not  available  in  low-income  countries  due  to prohibitive costs. Rituximab is a relatively inexpensive treatment, cheaper than any other approved DMTs for MS, and it is a feasible option in resource-limited settings (Mathew 2020). With increasing incidence  and  prevalence  of  MS  globally,  especially  in  low-  and middle-income countries, it is essential to ensure that people with MS  have  timely  access  to  safe  and  effective  treatments  (Lancet Neurology 2019).   We  considered  that  a  new  review  was  more  appropriate, rather  than  updating  the  previous  Cochrane  Review  (He  2013), because  changes  to  the  review  methods  were  substantive.  We decided  to  add  non-randomised  studies  to  the  review  that  was previously  restricted  to  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  to widen the evidence base, making use of the Risk Of Bias in Non- randomised  Studies  –  of  Interventions  tool  (ROBINS-I)  in  critical evaluation  of  the  validity  of  non-randomised  studies.  We  now added progressive forms of MS to the review that was previously restricted  to  relapsing  MS.  New  DMTs  have  been  approved  since the  early  2010s  to  treat  relapsing  and  progressive  MS,  therefore, we  added  new  comparisons  including  all  DMTs  that  were  used at  31  January  2021.  We  included  important  new  outcomes  (e.g. mortality, common infections, cancer) that were not addressed in the original review.   To assess beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' for adults with MS.   Specific comparisons included:   • rituximab as 'first choice' treatment compared with placebo or   other DMTs for relapsing forms of MS;   • rituximab as 'first choice' treatment compared with placebo or   other DMTs for progressive forms of MS;   • rituximab  as  'switching'  from  another  DMT  compared  with   placebo or other DMTs for relapsing forms of MS;   • rituximab  as  'switching'  from  another  DMT  compared  with   placebo or other DMTs for progressive forms of MS.   We  included  short-term  (12  to  24  months)  and  long-term  (>  24 months) outcomes reported in the included studies.   We included parallel RCTs and controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) of between-group design (i.e. open-label extension (OLE) studies, controlled clinical trials, controlled cohort studies, regression discontinuity designs, case-control studies, and registries).  We  had  two  main  justifications  for  including  NRSIs  in the  review.  First,  to  provide  evidence  of  the  effects  of  rituximab for which only few RCTs were available. Second, to address long- term outcomes and different populations that are typical of real- world  practice.  We  excluded  studies  of  within-group  design  (e.g. before-after (pre–post) studies with no control group, interrupted time series, and case reports).   We applied no limitations with respect to the length of follow-up or methods of analysis. We included full-text publications, results published in non-commercial trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov record),  and  abstracts  if  sufficient  information  was  available  on study  design,  characteristics  of  participants,  interventions,  and outcomes.   We  included  adults  (aged  18  years  or  older),  of  either  sex,  who were treatment-naive or non-responsive to their current DMT. We accepted any definition of non-response that the included studies used because the criteria for treatment failure, either using clinical or imaging criteria, were still not agreed upon and different criteria were  used  in  clinical  routine  practice.  Diagnostic  criteria  for  MS were  the  Poser  criteria  (Poser  1983),  and  the  McDonald  criteria and  its  revisions  (McDonald  2001;  Polman  2005;  Polman  2011; Thompson  2018).  We  included  all  forms  of  MS  (i.e.  relapsing  MS, secondary progressive MS, and primary progressive MS), regardless of disease duration and disability degree according to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (Kurtzke 1983).   Rituximab  as  'first  choice'  and  as  'switching'  treatment,  as monotherapy or in combination treatments, irrespective of doses, timing,  and  frequency  of  treatment.  We  included  combination treatments only if they were used in all the comparison groups.   We  included  studies  comparing  rituximab  with  placebo  or  with approved  DMTs,  interferons,  peg  interferon,  glatiramer  acetate, natalizumab,  mitoxantrone,  fingolimod,  teriflunomide,  dimethyl fumarate,  cladribine,  alemtuzumab,  daclizumab,  or  ocrelizumab. included  studies  that  assessed  switching  to  rituximab We from  another  DMT  compared  to  placebo  or  any  other  DMT, independently of the reason for switching, method, or time when the switch was made.   Primary outcomes   • Disability  worsening:  number  of  participants  with  sustained disability  worsening  based  on  clinical follow-up  visits. Worsening was defined as at least a 1-point increase on the EDSS (Kurtzke 1983), or a 0.5-point increase if the baseline EDSS score was  more  than  5.5,  confirmed  during  two  consecutive  clinical examinations  separated  by  an  interval  of  at  least  six  months free of attacks and carried out by the same physician. EDSS is an ordinal scale, where a score of 0 is no disability, 3 indicates mild disability, 6 walking stick requirement, 7 wheelchair use, and 10 is death from MS. An advantage of the EDSS over other disability  measures  is  its  international  acceptance  (e.g.  by  the European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA))  as  a  primary  endpoint  in clinical trials (EMA 2015), and its broad use in trials that enables cross-study comparisons (Meyer-Moock 2014). We also assessed time-to-disability worsening.   • Recurrence  of  relapse:  number  of  participants  with  clinical relapse, based on clinical follow-up visits. 'Relapse' was defined as  the  appearance  of  one  or  more  new  symptoms  due  to  MS, or the deterioration of pre-existing symptoms, persisting more than 24 hours in the absence of fever, and preceded by a period of  stability  of  at  least  one  month  (McDonald  2001).  We  also assessed time-to-relapse.   • Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs):  number  of  participants  with SAEs, as defined by the authors of the study. If an insufficient number  of  studies  reported  the  total  number  of  SAEs  and person-years, we used the number of participants with at least one SAE as defined in the study.   Secondary outcomes   The following four outcomes, together with the critical outcomes, were  prioritised  to  form  the  basis  of  the  GRADE  assessment  and were summarised in the review's abstract and in the summary of findings tables.   • Quality  of  life:  number  of  participants  reporting  quality  of  life impairment, assessed according to validated measures (e.g. the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 tool (MSQOL-54), which is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure (Vickrey 1995)).  MSQOL-54  includes  the  generic  36-item  Short-Form quality  of  life  instrument,  supplemented  with  18  MS-specific items that were based on expert opinion and literature review. There  is  no  single  overall  score  for  MSQOL-54.  Two  summary scores, physical health and mental health, can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores (scale scores range from 0 to 100 and a higher scale score indicates improved quality of life).   • Number of participants with common infections. • Number of participants with cancer. • Mortality.   • Annualised relapse rate (ARR): mean number of new relapses per participant, adjusted for the duration of follow-up to annualise it.  ARR  is  a  frequently  reported  clinical  outcome  in  trials  on relapsing MS.   • Cognitive  decline:  number  of  participants  with  cognitive worsening,  assessed  according  to  validated  neurocognitive batteries International  Cognitive Assessment  for  Multiple  Sclerosis  (BICAMS)  (Benedict  2020; Langdon 2012).   for  MS  (e.g.  the  Brief   • Number of participants with new or enlarging T2-weighted MRI lesions*.  A  T2-weighted  MRI  sequence  provides  information about the total number of lesions. T2 lesions appear as bright spots on the scan and could correlate to a panel of different MS pathological hallmarks. However, new T2 lesions are used as a measure of disease activity.   • Number  of  participants  with  new  gadolinium-enhancing positive  T1-weighted  MRI  lesions*.  T1-weighted  MRI  lesions, mostly black holes, are believed to represent permanent tissue damage.  Gadolinium-enhancing  T1  lesions  are  a  surrogate  for blood–brain barrier breakdown.   • Number  of  participants  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to adverse events. We also assessed time-to-discontinuation. • Number of participants with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events   (US Department of Health and Human Services 2017).   participants  with   adverse events:  opportunistic  infections,  hypogammaglobulinaemia, cardiovascular events (hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias, and angina), and HBV reactivation.   long-term   • Number  of  participants  with  short-term  adverse  events:   infusion-related reactions.   *We judged MRI lesions as surrogate outcomes, but included them in  the  review  in  the  presumption  that  changes  in  the  surrogate reflect  changes  in  relapse  and  disability  that  are  important  to patients.   We applied no time, language, or publication status restrictions to the search for primary studies.   We designed search strategies for electronic databases according to  methods  suggested  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic Reviews  of  Interventions  (Lefebvre  2019).  The  Cochrane  Multiple Sclerosis  and  Rare  Diseases  of  the  Central  Nervous  System Group's Information Specialist designed and executed the search strategies. We searched the following databases and trials registries for  primary  studies,  updated  on  31  January  2021.  The  search strategies  are  documented  in  Appendix  1.  For  studies  that  are listed  in  trials  registries  and  not  yet  published  in  full  elsewhere, we  included  them  as  ongoing  studies  for  the  current  review, and  will  add  or  update  data  in  updates  of  the  review  once  they are available as full-text reports.   • Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL,  the   • Embase (Embase.com) (1974 to 31 January 2021). • CINAHL (via EBSCO) (1981 to 31 January 2021).   Trials registries and registry platforms to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies   • World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  International  Clinical  Trials   Registry Platform (ICTRP) (trialsearch.who.int). Institutes  of  Health  clinical   • US  National   trial  register   • European   (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu).   Searching other resources   We reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles, review articles, and textbooks. We contacted study investigators to request missing data.   Data collection and analysis   Selection of studies   We used the search strategy described in the Search methods for identification  of  studies  section  to  obtain  titles  and  abstracts  of studies. Two review authors (GF and JK) independently screened the  titles  and  abstracts  and  discarded  studies  that  were  not applicable;  however,  they  initially  retained  studies  and  reviews that might have included relevant data or information on eligible studies. Two review authors (GF and JK) independently assessed the retrieved abstracts and, when necessary, the full-text articles to  determine  which  studies  satisfied  the  inclusion  criteria.  The two review authors compared multiple reports of the same study and  used  the  most  comprehensive  report.  They  linked  multiple publications as companion reports, but excluded true duplicates. GF  and  JK  resolved  discrepancies  in  judgement  by  discussion, and  reported  excluded  studies  and  their  reasons  for  exclusion  in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. We reported included studies in the Characteristics of included studies table. We created a PRISMA flow chart reporting the selection process (Moher 2009).   Data extraction and management   Two  review  authors  (GF  and  JK)  independently  extracted  data using  a  predefined  data  extraction  form  in  an  Excel  spreadsheet. They  resolved  any  disagreements  by  discussion.  We  requested additional  data  through  correspondence  with  four  study  authors (Filippini  2021a;  Filippini  2021b;  Filippini  2021c;  Filippini  2021d). Authors  of  two  included  studies  provided  us  with  additional outcome data.   Outcome data   We extracted the following data from each included study:   • number of participants who had disability worsening based on   clinical follow-up visits;   • number  of  participants  who  had  clinical  relapses  based  on   clinical follow-up visits;   • number who withdrew due to any adverse event; • measures  and  results  of  critical  and  important  outcomes  that were reported in the included studies (e.g. hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event outcomes).",

         "BACKGROUND\nLow back pain (LBP) is a significant public health issue due to its high prevalence and associated disability burden. Clinical practice guidelines recommend non-pharmacological/non-surgical interventions for managing pain and function in people with LBP.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo provide accessible, high-quality evidence on the effects of non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions for people with LBP and to highlight areas of remaining uncertainty and gaps in the evidence regarding the effects of these interventions for people with LBP.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to 15 April 2023, to identify Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials testing the effect of non-pharmacological/non-surgical interventions, unrestricted by language. Major outcomes were pain intensity, function and safety. Two authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and assessed the quality of the reviews using AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was placebo/sham.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 31 Cochrane reviews of 644 trials that randomised 97,183 adults with LBP. We have high confidence in the findings of 19 reviews, moderate confidence in the findings of two reviews, and low confidence in the findings of 10 reviews. We present results for non-pharmacological/non-surgical interventions compared to placebo/sham or no treatment/usual care at short-term (≤ three months) follow-up. Placebo/sham comparisons Acute/subacute LBP Compared to placebo, there is probably no difference in function (at one-week follow-up) for spinal manipulation (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to 0.21; 2 trials, 205 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Data for safety were reported only for heated back wrap. Compared to placebo, heated back wrap may result in skin pinkness (6/128 participants versus 1/130; 2 trials; low-certainty evidence). Chronic LBP Compared to sham acupuncture, acupuncture probably provides a small improvement in function (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.07; 3 trials, 957 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to sham traction, there is probably no difference in pain intensity for traction (0 to 100 scale, mean difference (MD) -4, 95% CI -17.7 to 9.7; 1 trial, 60 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Data for safety were reported only for acupuncture. There may be no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture for safety outcomes (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.10; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 465 participants; low-certainty evidence). No treatment/usual care comparisons Acute/subacute LBP Compared to advice to rest, advice to stay active probably provides a small reduction in pain intensity (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.41; 2 trials, 401 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to advice to rest, advice to stay active probably provides a small improvement in function (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.49; 2 trials, 400 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Data for safety were reported only for massage. There may be no difference between massage and usual care for safety (risk difference 0, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.07; 1 trial, 51 participants; low-certainty evidence). Chronic LBP Compared to no treatment, acupuncture probably provides a medium reduction in pain intensity (0 to 100 scale, mean difference (MD) -10.1, 95% CI -16.8 to -3.4; 3 trials, 144 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and a small improvement in function (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.06; 3 trials, 144 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to usual care, acupuncture probably provides a small improvement in function (MD 9.4, 95% CI 6.15 to 12.65; 1 trial, 734 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to no treatment/usual care, exercise therapies probably provide a small to medium reduction in pain intensity (0 to 100 scale, MD -15.2, 95% CI -18.3 to -12.2; 35 trials, 2746 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably provide a small improvement in function (0 to 100 scale, MD -6.8, 95% CI -8.3 to -5.3; 38 trials, 2942 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to usual care, multidisciplinary therapies probably provide a medium reduction in pain intensity (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.28; 9 trials, 879 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably provide a small improvement in function (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.19; 9 trials, 939 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to no treatment, psychological therapies using operant approaches probably provide a small reduction in pain intensity (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.11; 3 trials, 153 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to usual care, psychological therapies (including progressive muscle relaxation and behavioural approaches) probably provide a small reduction in pain intensity (0 to 100 scale, MD -5.18, 95% CI -9.79 to -0.57; 2 trials, 330 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but there is probably no difference in function (SMD -0.2, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.02; 2 trials, 330 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between non-pharmacological/non-surgical interventions and no treatment/usual care for safety (very low-certainty evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nSpinal manipulation probably makes no difference to function compared to placebo for people with acute/subacute LBP. Acupuncture probably improves function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to sham acupuncture. There is probably no difference between traction and sham traction for pain intensity in people with chronic LBP. Compared to advice to rest, advice to stay active probably reduces pain intensity slightly and improves function slightly for people with acute LBP. Acupuncture probably reduces pain intensity, and improves function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to no treatment. Acupuncture probably improves function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to usual care. Exercise therapies probably reduce pain intensity, and improve function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to no treatment/usual care. Multidisciplinary therapies probably reduce pain intensity, and improve function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to usual care. Compared to usual care, psychological therapies probably reduce pain intensity slightly, but probably make no difference to function for people with chronic LBP.",

         "RATIONALE\nThe increasing prevalence of myopia is a growing global public health problem, in terms of rates of uncorrected refractive error and significantly, an increased risk of visual impairment due to myopia-related ocular morbidity. Interventions to slow its progression are needed in childhood, when myopia progression is most rapid. This is a review update, conducted as part of a living systematic review.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for slowing myopia progression in children using network meta-analysis (NMA). To generate a relative ranking of interventions according to their efficacy. To produce a brief economic commentary, summarising economic evaluations.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three trial registers. The latest search date was 19 February 2024.\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of optical, pharmacological, light therapy and behavioural interventions for slowing myopia progression in children, up to 18 years old.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nCritical outcomes were progression of myopia (mean difference (MD) in the change in spherical equivalent refraction (SER, dioptres (D)), and axial length (AL, mm) in the intervention and control groups at one year or longer), and difference in the change in SER and AL following cessation of treatment (rebound).\n\n\nRISK OF BIAS\nWe assessed the risk of bias (RoB) for SER and AL using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS METHODS\nWe followed standard Cochrane methods. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for change in SER and AL at one and two years. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to rank the interventions for all available outcomes.\n\n\nINCLUDED STUDIES\nWe included 104 studies (40 new for this update) that randomised 17,509 children, aged 4 years to 18 years. Most studies were conducted in China or other Asian countries (66.3%), and North America (14.4%). Eighty-four studies (80.8%) compared myopia control interventions against inactive controls. Study durations ranged from 12 months to 48 months.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS OF RESULTS\nSince most of the networks in the NMA were poorly connected, our estimates are based on direct (pairwise) comparisons, unless stated otherwise. The median change in SER for controls was -0.65 D (55 studies, 4888 participants; one-year follow-up). These interventions may reduce SER progression compared to controls: repeated low intensity red light (RLRL: MD 0.80 D, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.89; SUCRA = 93.8%; very low-certainty evidence); high-dose atropine (HDA (≥ 0.5%): MD 0.90 D, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.18; SUCRA = 93.3%; moderate-certainty evidence); medium-dose atropine (MDA (0.1% to < 0.5%): MD 0.55 D, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93; NMA estimate SUCRA = 75.5%; low-certainty evidence); low dose atropine (LDA (< 0.1%): MD 0.25 D, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.35; SUCRA = 53.2%; very low-certainty evidence); peripheral plus spectacle lenses (PPSL: MD 0.45 D, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.74; SUCRA = 50.2%; very low-certainty evidence); multifocal soft contact lenses (MFSCL: MD 0.27 D, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.35; SUCRA = 49.9%; very low-certainty evidence); and multifocal spectacle lenses (MFSL: MD 0.14 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.21; SUCRA = 30.8%; low-certainty evidence). The median change in AL for controls was 0.33 mm (58 studies, 9085 participants; one-year follow-up). These interventions may reduce axial elongation compared to controls: RLRL (MD -0.33 mm, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.29; SUCRA = 98.6%; very low-certainty evidence); HDA (MD -0.33 mm, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.30; SUCRA = 88.4%; moderate-certainty evidence); MDA (MD -0.24 mm, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.15; NMA estimate SUCRA = 75.8%; low-certainty evidence); LDA (MD -0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.07; SUCRA = 36.1%; very low-certainty evidence); orthokeratology (ortho-K: MD -0.18 mm, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.14; SUCRA = 79%; moderate-certainty evidence); PPSL (MD -0.13 mm, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.05; SUCRA = 52.6%; very low-certainty evidence); MFSCL (MD -0.11 mm, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.09; SUCRA = 45.6%; low-certainty evidence); and MFSL (MD -0.06 mm, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.04; SUCRA = 26.3%; low-certainty evidence). Ortho-K plus LDA probably reduces axial elongation more than ortho-K monotherapy (MD -0.12 mm, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.09; SUCRA = 81.8%; moderate-certainty evidence). At two-year follow-up, change in SER was reported in 34 studies (3556 participants). The median change in SER for controls was -1.01 D. The ranking of interventions to reduce SER progression was close to that observed at one year; there were insufficient data to draw conclusions on cumulative effects. The highest-ranking interventions were: HAD (SUCRA = 97%); MDA (NMA estimate SUCRA = 69.8%); and PPSL (SUCRA = 69.1%). At two-year follow-up, change in AL was reported in 33 studies (3334 participants). The median change in AL for controls was 0.56 mm. The ranking of interventions to reduce axial elongation was similar to that observed at one year; there were insufficient data to draw conclusions on cumulative effects. The highest-ranking interventions were: ortho-K plus LDA (SUCRA = 94.2%); HAD (SUCRA = 96.8%); and MDA (NMA estimate SUCRA = 88.4%). There was limited evidence on whether cessation of myopia control therapy increases progression beyond the expected rate of progression with age. Adverse events and treatment adherence were not consistently reported. Two studies reported quality of life, showing little to no difference between intervention and control groups. We were unable to draw firm conclusions regarding the relative costs or efficiency of different myopia control strategies in children.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nMost studies compared pharmacological and optical treatments to slow the progression of myopia with an inactive comparator. These interventions may slow refractive change and reduce axial elongation, although results were often heterogeneous. Less evidence is available for two years and beyond; uncertainty remains about the sustained effect of these interventions. Longer term and better quality studies comparing myopia control interventions alone or in combination are needed, with improved methods for monitoring and reporting adverse effects.\n\n\nFUNDING\nCochrane Eyes and Vision US Project is supported by grant UG1EY020522, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health.\n\n\nREGISTRATION\nThe previous version of this living systematic review is available at doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD014758.pub2.",

         "BACKGROUND\nMatched targeted therapies (MTT) given alone or in combination with systemic anti-cancer therapies have delivered proven survival benefit for many people with newly diagnosed cancer. However, there is little evidence of their effectiveness in the recurrent or late-stage setting. With this uncertainty, alongside the perception that late-stage cancers are too genetically heterogenous or too mutationally diverse to benefit from matched targeted therapies, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumours in people with refractory cancer remains a low priority. As a result, next-generation sequencing testing of recurrent or late-stage disease is discouraged. We lack evidence to support the utility of next generation sequencing in guiding matched targeted therapies in this setting.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of matched targeted therapies in people with advanced cancers in randomised controlled trials.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) search portal up to 30th October 2024. We also screened reference lists of included studies and also the publications that cited these studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had enroled participants with advanced/refractory solid or haematological cancers who had progressed through at least one line of standard anti-cancer systemic therapy. To be eligible, all participants should have received matched targeted therapy based on next-generation sequencing carried out on their tumour (tumour tissue, blood or bone marrow).\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe systematically searched medical databases (e.g. MEDLINE, Embase) and trial registers for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Outcomes of interest were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rates (ORR), serious (grade 3 or 4) adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QOL). We used a random-eﬀects model to pool outcomes across studies and compared predeﬁned subgroups using interaction tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment of certainty was used to evaluate the quality of evidence.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified a total of 37 studies, out of which 35 studies (including 9819 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. All included studies compared a matched targeted therapy intervention to standard-of-care treatment, non-matched targeted therapies or no treatment (best supportive care): Matched targeted therapy versus standard-of-care treatment Matched targeted therapy (MTT) compared with standard systematic therapy probably reduces the risk of disease progression by 34% (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.74; 14 studies, 3848 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, MTT might have little to no difference in risk of death (HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 14 studies, 3848 participants; low-certainty evidence) and may increase overall response rates (low-certainty evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference in severe (grade 3/4) adverse events between matched targeted therapy and standard-of-care treatment (low-certainty evidence). There was limited evidence of a difference in quality of life between groups (very low-certainty of evidence). Matched targeted therapy in combination with standard-of-care treatment versus standard-of-care treatment alone Matched targeted therapy in combination with standard-of-care treatment compared with standard-of-care treatment alone probably reduces the risk of disease progression by 39% (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.53-0.70, 14 studies, 2,637 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and risk of death by 21% (HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; 11 studies, 2575 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). The combination of MTT and standard-of-care treatment may also increase overall response rates (low-certainty evidence). There was limited evidence of a difference in the incidence of severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence) and quality of life between the groups (very low-certainty of evidence). Matched targeted therapy versus non-matched targeted therapy Matched targeted therapy compared with non-matched targeted therapy probably reduces the risk of disease progression by 24% (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.89; 3 studies, 1568 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of death by 25% (HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86, 1307 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on overall response rates between MTT and non-MTT. There was no clear evidence of a difference in overall response rates (low-certainty evidence) and severe adverse events between MTT and non-MTT (low-certainty evidence). None of the studies comparing MTT and non-MTT reported quality of life. Matched targeted therapy versus best supportive care Matched targeted therapy compared with the best supportive care (BSC) i.e. no active treatment probably reduces the risk of disease progression by 63% (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; 4 studies, 858 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference in overall survival between groups (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06, 3 studies, 783 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference in overall response rates (very low-certainty of evidence) and incidence of severe adverse events (very low-certainty of evidence) between the groups. Quality of life was reported in a single study but did not provide composite scores. Risk of bias The overall risk of bias was judged low for eight studies, unclear for two studies, and the remaining 27 studies were high risk.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nMatched targeted therapies guided by next-generation sequencing in people with advanced cancer prolongs the time before cancer progresses compared to standard therapies. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that it prolongs overall survival, improves the quality of life or increases adverse events. Importantly, this review supports equitable access to next-generation sequencing technology for all people with advanced cancer and offers them the opportunity to access genotype-matched targeted therapies.",

Phase I, II and III oncology\ntrials  routinely  enrol  people  with  relapsed  or  metastatic  cancer\nwhose disease has become refractory to available treatment and all\nlines of standard therapies have been exhausted.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAlthough  the  primary  aim  of  early  phase  trials  has  been  to\nelucidate  the  safety  profile  of  novel  drugs  and  to  establish\ntheir pharmacokinetic properties, it also provides the participants\nthe  opportunity  to  clinically  benefit  from  these  novel  therapies.\nHowever, despite the promise,  these trials have historically been\ntermed as 'toxicity trials' because of their low likelihood of benefit.\nSince  the  1970s,  the  overall  response  rates  observed  in  phase  I\ntrials  has  increased  from  less  than  5%  to  almost  20%,  or  even\nhigher  (approximately  42%)  when  a  specific  mutation  that  is\nhighly expressed in the cancer, referred as genomic biomarker, is\nused  as  a  surrogate  for  selecting  patients  for  targeted  therapies\n(Adashek  2019;  Hortsmann  2005;  Lipsett  1982).  Therefore,  the\nemergence of targeted therapies in early-phase trials has created\nan  increased  need  for  molecular  diagnosis  for  identifying  these\nmutations.  Next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  technologies  have\nsignificantly  increased  throughput  speed  of  molecular  diagnosis,\nmaking  it  possible  for  DNA  sequencing  to  garner  global  genetic\ninformation about people for whom therapeutic decisions can be\nmade expeditiously.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nRecent  innovation  in  NGS  technology,  together  with  technical\nadvancements in molecular biology, has led to the era of precision\nmedicine. Tumour genomic information can be obtained through\nanalysis  of  biopsies  or  via  non-invasive  methods  using,  for\nexample, liquid biopsies to detect cell-free circulating tumour DNA\n(ctDNA) and circulating tumour cells (CTCs) from many body fluids\nsuch  as  saliva,  blood  and  urine  (Fici  2019).  This  can  be  used\nas  a  screening  tool  for  the  detection  of  specific  mutations  that\nmay confer benefit from molecularly targeted therapeutics. Liquid\ntesting has a significantly faster turnaround for results compared\nto  tissue  biopsies,  making  it  feasible  to  be  performed  in  a  clinic\nsetting.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nMulti-gene  panels  are  commonly  used  to  identify  the  mutational\nstate  of  a  pre-determined  selection  of  genes  within  the\ncancer genome, by searching for specific biomarkers with known\ntherapeutic  interactions.  The  panel  of  genes  being  screened  will\nvary between cancer types, depending on the existing evidence for\ngenetic  interaction.  This  is  one  of  the  main  potential  utilities  of\nthe NGS platform: guiding physicians to select people for targeted\ntherapies.  These  therapies  can  be  matched  to  a  mutation  of\ninterest and inhibit a specific signalling cascade that is key to the\nbehaviour  of  a  certain  cancer.  Thus,  they  may  affect  cancer  cells\nmore than normal cells. Their specific action differs from traditional\nchemotherapy,  which  affects  all  rapidly-proliferating  cells.  The\nthree main classes of targeted therapy include the following (NCI).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n1.

Examples\ninclude  ceritinib,\nwhich  was  approved  for  people  with  Anaplastic  Lymphoma\nKinase  (ALK)  gene  mutation\nin  non-small  cell  lung  cancer\n(NSCLC)  on  the  basis  of  an  overall  response  rate  of  58%\nreported  in  a  phase  I  study  (Chabner  2014).  Molecularly  guided\ntargeted  therapy  has  also  been  used\nin  colorectal  cancer\n(e.g. cetuximab in wildtype KRAS, BRAF and NRAS), breast cancer\n(e.g.  alpelisib  in  PIK3CA  mutation),  and  urothelial  carcinoma\n(e.g. erdafitinib in FGFR2/3 mutation) (André 2019; De Roock 2010;\nLoriot  2019).  In  the  context  of  haematological  malignancies,  the\nimpact  of  targeted  therapies  has  been  most  marked  in  disorders\ndefined by balanced translocations: e.g. Imatinib against a fusion\nprotein generated by BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukaemia and\nall-trans  retinoic  acid  (ATRA)  against  PML/RARα  fusion  protein  in\nacute  pro-myelocytic  leukaemia.  More  recently,  inhibitors  of  the\nFMS-like  tyrosine  kinase  3  (FLT3)  and  isocitrate  dehydrogenase\nenzymes (IDH1/2) have been licenced in FLT3- and IDH1/2-mutated\nacute myeloid leukaemia (Thol 2020; Wertheim 2012). In addition,\nthe  safety  profile  of  these  therapies  has  often  been  shown  to\nbe more favourable compared to conventional chemotherapy (Le\nTourneau 2015; Schwaederle 2016).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nfor  molecular  screening  has\nUtilisation  of  NGS  platforms\nled  to  a  shift  in  the  paradigm  of  early-phase  trial  design.\nThis  includes  recruitment  of  people  with  different  primary\ncancer  subtypes  but  with  common  molecular  alterations  (basket\ntrials);  or  differentiating  a  single  primary  cancer  into  different\nmolecular  subtypes  (umbrella  trials)  (Park  2019).  Targeted\ntherapies  which  have  already  been  licenced  by  the  US  Food\nand  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  European  Medical  Agency\n(EMA)  for  a  particular  cancer  subtype  can  potentially  be  re-\npurposed  for  other  cancer  subtypes  to  maximise  their  benefit\nby  selecting  people  with  specific  biomarkers.  Examples  of  re-\npurposed  molecularly-targeted  drugs  that  have  been  approved\nfor  other  cancer  subsets  include  trastuzumab  (Herceptin),  a\nmonoclonal  antibody  directed  at  the  human  epidermal  growth\nfactor  receptor  2  (HER2)  receptor,  for  the  treatment  of  people\nwith advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers with\nHER2 positivity, beyond its original licence of HER positive breast\ncancer  (Dean-Colomb  2008;  Zhao  2019).  Additional  examples\ninclude  bevacizumab,  a  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  A\n(VEGF-A)  targeting  therapy,  which  was  first  approved  by  the\nFDA in 2004 for use in advanced metastatic colorectal cancers as an\nangiogenesis inhibitor. Since 2004, broader use of bevacizumab in\na  variety  of  advanced  solid  tumours  (including  non-small  cell\nlung cancer, metastatic breast, renal, ovarian, cervical cancer and\nglioblastoma) has proven effective, and angiogenesis-independent\nuses  of  bevacizumab  for  immunomodulation  are  now  being\nexplored (Garcia 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nNext-generation sequencing for guiding matched targeted therapies in people with relapsed or metastatic cancer (Protocol)\nCopyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Furthermore,  from  a  trial\nperspective, it may also expedite approval for drug development,\nas  reports  have  revealed  that  an  overall  response  rate  of  greater\nthan  30%  with  a  monotherapy  is  likely  to  lead  to  accelerated\napproval by the FDA (Oxnard 2016).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOn  the  contrary,  it  is  important  to  recognise  that  the  use\nof  a  targeted  therapy\nin  people  who  do  not  carry  the\nspecific  mutation  of  interest,  in  some  cases,  may  result  in\na  more  detrimental  outcome.  For  example,  using  cetuximab\n(a  monoclonal  antibody  that  targets  epidermal  growth  factor\nreceptor  (EGFR)  downstream  signalling)  in  combination  with\nradiotherapy\nin  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)-positive  locally\nadvanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma showed inferior\noverall  survival  and  progression-free  survival  than  concurrent\nchemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (Ang 2014). However, it cannot\nbe  assumed  that  matching  a  tumour  mutation  to  a  targeted\ntherapy is going to lead to unequivocal benefit. In 2015, the SHIVA\ntrial  compared  molecularly  targeted  therapy  versus  conventional\ntherapy  in  741  participants  with  metastatic  refractory  solid\ntumours.  The  study  reported  no  significant  improvement  in\nprogression-free  survival  compared  to  standard  (non-targeted)\ntreatment (Le Tourneau 2015). In contrast, a recent meta-analysis\nof 346 phase I trials including 13,203 people found that biomarker-\nbased targeted therapy was associated with an improved median\nprogression free survival (median 5.7 months versus 2.95 months)\n(Schwaederle 2016).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDespite  advances  in  NGS  technology,  there  are  still  significant\ndelays\nidentifying  and  recruiting  people  with  relapsed/\nmetastatic  cancers  who  may  benefit  from  matched  targeted\ntherapy  trials  as  opposed  to  non-matched  therapies.  One  of  the\nmajor  reasons  for  this  has  been  attributed  to  lack  of  resources\nas  sequencing  technology  is  not  readily  available  at  many\ncentres  and  the  anti-cancer  therapies  available  to  people  do  not\ncomprehensively include inhibitors to all common gene mutations.\nFurthermore, there are no data about the commonest actionable\nmutations  in  the  tumour  agnostic  setting.  As  a  result,  there  is\na  lack  of  high  quality  and  reliable  evidence  on  the  effectiveness\nof  NGS-based  matched  targeted  therapies  as  a  valid  therapeutic\noption,  and  the  impact  they  may  have  on  the  quality  of  life  for\nthose participants enrolled in phase I, II and III trials.  Hence, the\naim  of  this  Cochrane  Review  is  to  assess  oncological  outcomes\nand adverse events associated with the use of targeted therapies\ncompared to non-matched therapies in this cohort.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo  evaluate  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  matched  targeted\ntherapies in people with relapsed or metastatic cancer in phase I,\nII and III trials.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nTypes of studies\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe  aim  to  include  phase  I,  II  and  III  randomised  controlled  trials\n(RCTs).    Since  most  early-phase  clinical  trials  may  not  have  a\nrandom  component,  we  will  therefore  include  non-randomised\nstudies  (NRS)  as  long  as  they  compared  people  with  relapsed/\nmetastatic disease who did and did not receive matched targeted\ntherapies.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014872.   Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.   This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows:   To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of matched targeted therapies in people with relapsed or metastatic cancer in phase I, II and III trials.   Worldwide, the burden of cancer incidence and mortality is rapidly increasing, with an annual incidence of 19.3 million new cases and approximately 10 million deaths from cancer globally (GLOBOCAN 2020). In the United Kingdom, cancer accounts for more than one quarter (28%) of all deaths, which is equivalent to 165,000 deaths in the UK per year (Cancer Research UK). Phase I, II and III oncology trials  routinely  enrol  people  with  relapsed  or  metastatic  cancer whose disease has become refractory to available treatment and all lines of standard therapies have been exhausted.   Although  the  primary  aim  of  early  phase  trials  has  been  to elucidate  the  safety  profile  of  novel  drugs  and  to  establish their pharmacokinetic properties, it also provides the participants the  opportunity  to  clinically  benefit  from  these  novel  therapies. However, despite the promise,  these trials have historically been termed as 'toxicity trials' because of their low likelihood of benefit. Since  the  1970s,  the  overall  response  rates  observed  in  phase  I trials  has  increased  from  less  than  5%  to  almost  20%,  or  even higher  (approximately  42%)  when  a  specific  mutation  that  is highly expressed in the cancer, referred as genomic biomarker, is used  as  a  surrogate  for  selecting  patients  for  targeted  therapies (Adashek  2019;  Hortsmann  2005;  Lipsett  1982).  Therefore,  the emergence of targeted therapies in early-phase trials has created an  increased  need  for  molecular  diagnosis  for  identifying  these mutations.  Next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  technologies  have significantly  increased  throughput  speed  of  molecular  diagnosis, making  it  possible  for  DNA  sequencing  to  garner  global  genetic information about people for whom therapeutic decisions can be made expeditiously.   Recent  innovation  in  NGS  technology,  together  with  technical advancements in molecular biology, has led to the era of precision medicine. Tumour genomic information can be obtained through analysis  of  biopsies  or  via  non-invasive  methods  using,  for example, liquid biopsies to detect cell-free circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumour cells (CTCs) from many body fluids such  as  saliva,  blood  and  urine  (Fici  2019).  This  can  be  used as  a  screening  tool  for  the  detection  of  specific  mutations  that may confer benefit from molecularly targeted therapeutics. Liquid testing has a significantly faster turnaround for results compared to  tissue  biopsies,  making  it  feasible  to  be  performed  in  a  clinic setting.   Multi-gene  panels  are  commonly  used  to  identify  the  mutational state  of  a  pre-determined  selection  of  genes  within  the cancer genome, by searching for specific biomarkers with known therapeutic  interactions.  The  panel  of  genes  being  screened  will vary between cancer types, depending on the existing evidence for genetic  interaction.  This  is  one  of  the  main  potential  utilities  of the NGS platform: guiding physicians to select people for targeted therapies.  These  therapies  can  be  matched  to  a  mutation  of interest and inhibit a specific signalling cascade that is key to the behaviour  of  a  certain  cancer.  Thus,  they  may  affect  cancer  cells more than normal cells. Their specific action differs from traditional chemotherapy,  which  affects  all  rapidly-proliferating  cells.  The three main classes of targeted therapy include the following (NCI).   1. Small  molecule  drug  classes,  in  which  molecules  are  small   enough to enter cells and target intracellular kinases.   2. Monoclonal  antibodies,  which  are  too  large  to  enter  cells  but   affect targets outside of cells or targets on the cell surface.   3. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which are complex molecules composed of an antibody linked to a biologically active cytotoxic (anticancer) payload or drug.   For  a  wide  range  of  advanced  solid  and  haematological cancers,  molecularly  guided  targeted  therapy  has  already become  the  standard  of  care.  Examples include  ceritinib, which  was  approved  for  people  with  Anaplastic  Lymphoma Kinase  (ALK)  gene  mutation in  non-small  cell  lung  cancer (NSCLC)  on  the  basis  of  an  overall  response  rate  of  58% reported  in  a  phase  I  study  (Chabner  2014).  Molecularly  guided targeted  therapy  has  also  been  used in  colorectal  cancer (e.g. cetuximab in wildtype KRAS, BRAF and NRAS), breast cancer (e.g.  alpelisib  in  PIK3CA  mutation),  and  urothelial  carcinoma (e.g. erdafitinib in FGFR2/3 mutation) (André 2019; De Roock 2010; Loriot  2019).  In  the  context  of  haematological  malignancies,  the impact  of  targeted  therapies  has  been  most  marked  in  disorders defined by balanced translocations: e.g. Imatinib against a fusion protein generated by BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukaemia and all-trans  retinoic  acid  (ATRA)  against  PML/RARα  fusion  protein  in acute  pro-myelocytic  leukaemia.  More  recently,  inhibitors  of  the FMS-like  tyrosine  kinase  3  (FLT3)  and  isocitrate  dehydrogenase enzymes (IDH1/2) have been licenced in FLT3- and IDH1/2-mutated acute myeloid leukaemia (Thol 2020; Wertheim 2012). In addition, the  safety  profile  of  these  therapies  has  often  been  shown  to be more favourable compared to conventional chemotherapy (Le Tourneau 2015; Schwaederle 2016).   for  molecular  screening  has Utilisation  of  NGS  platforms led  to  a  shift  in  the  paradigm  of  early-phase  trial  design. This  includes  recruitment  of  people  with  different  primary cancer  subtypes  but  with  common  molecular  alterations  (basket trials);  or  differentiating  a  single  primary  cancer  into  different molecular  subtypes  (umbrella  trials)  (Park  2019).  Targeted therapies  which  have  already  been  licenced  by  the  US  Food and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  European  Medical  Agency (EMA)  for  a  particular  cancer  subtype  can  potentially  be  re- purposed  for  other  cancer  subtypes  to  maximise  their  benefit by  selecting  people  with  specific  biomarkers.  Examples  of  re- purposed  molecularly-targeted  drugs  that  have  been  approved for  other  cancer  subsets  include  trastuzumab  (Herceptin),  a monoclonal  antibody  directed  at  the  human  epidermal  growth factor  receptor  2  (HER2)  receptor,  for  the  treatment  of  people with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers with HER2 positivity, beyond its original licence of HER positive breast cancer  (Dean-Colomb  2008;  Zhao  2019).  Additional  examples include  bevacizumab,  a  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  A (VEGF-A)  targeting  therapy,  which  was  first  approved  by  the FDA in 2004 for use in advanced metastatic colorectal cancers as an angiogenesis inhibitor. Since 2004, broader use of bevacizumab in a  variety  of  advanced  solid  tumours  (including  non-small  cell lung cancer, metastatic breast, renal, ovarian, cervical cancer and glioblastoma) has proven effective, and angiogenesis-independent uses  of  bevacizumab  for  immunomodulation  are  now  being explored (Garcia 2020).   The  development  of  highly  specific  molecularly  targeted  agents, and  the  increasing  use  of  genomic  biomarkers  for  selection of  people,  may  provide  therapeutic  value  for  those  people who  harbour  actionable  mutations.  Furthermore,  from  a  trial perspective, it may also expedite approval for drug development, as  reports  have  revealed  that  an  overall  response  rate  of  greater than  30%  with  a  monotherapy  is  likely  to  lead  to  accelerated approval by the FDA (Oxnard 2016).   On  the  contrary,  it  is  important  to  recognise  that  the  use of  a  targeted  therapy in  people  who  do  not  carry  the specific  mutation  of  interest,  in  some  cases,  may  result  in a  more  detrimental  outcome.  For  example,  using  cetuximab (a  monoclonal  antibody  that  targets  epidermal  growth  factor receptor  (EGFR)  downstream  signalling)  in  combination  with radiotherapy in  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)-positive  locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma showed inferior overall  survival  and  progression-free  survival  than  concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (Ang 2014). However, it cannot be  assumed  that  matching  a  tumour  mutation  to  a  targeted therapy is going to lead to unequivocal benefit. In 2015, the SHIVA trial  compared  molecularly  targeted  therapy  versus  conventional therapy  in  741  participants  with  metastatic  refractory  solid tumours.  The  study  reported  no  significant  improvement  in progression-free  survival  compared  to  standard  (non-targeted) treatment (Le Tourneau 2015). In contrast, a recent meta-analysis of 346 phase I trials including 13,203 people found that biomarker- based targeted therapy was associated with an improved median progression free survival (median 5.7 months versus 2.95 months) (Schwaederle 2016).   Despite  advances  in  NGS  technology,  there  are  still  significant delays identifying  and  recruiting  people  with  relapsed/ metastatic  cancers  who  may  benefit  from  matched  targeted therapy  trials  as  opposed  to  non-matched  therapies.  One  of  the major  reasons  for  this  has  been  attributed  to  lack  of  resources as  sequencing  technology  is  not  readily  available  at  many centres  and  the  anti-cancer  therapies  available  to  people  do  not comprehensively include inhibitors to all common gene mutations. Furthermore, there are no data about the commonest actionable mutations  in  the  tumour  agnostic  setting.  As  a  result,  there  is a  lack  of  high  quality  and  reliable  evidence  on  the  effectiveness of  NGS-based  matched  targeted  therapies  as  a  valid  therapeutic option,  and  the  impact  they  may  have  on  the  quality  of  life  for those participants enrolled in phase I, II and III trials.  Hence, the aim  of  this  Cochrane  Review  is  to  assess  oncological  outcomes and adverse events associated with the use of targeted therapies compared to non-matched therapies in this cohort.   To  evaluate  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  matched  targeted therapies in people with relapsed or metastatic cancer in phase I, II and III trials.   Criteria for considering studies for this review   Types of studies   We  aim  to  include  phase  I,  II  and  III  randomised  controlled  trials (RCTs).    Since  most  early-phase  clinical  trials  may  not  have  a random  component,  we  will  therefore  include  non-randomised studies  (NRS)  as  long  as  they  compared  people  with  relapsed/ metastatic disease who did and did not receive matched targeted therapies. Studies reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data will be included in this review.   Types of participants   We will include all adults (aged 18 and over) with advanced solid or  haematological  cancers  who  have  been  enrolled  in  phase  I, II  and  III  trials.  They  must  have  had  a  histological  diagnosis  of malignancy  and  confirmed  evidence  of  unresectable,  metastatic or refractory disease. Histological confirmation could either come from  the  primary  site  (including  resection  or  biopsy  prior  to  the development  of  metastatic  disease)  or  a  site  of  metastasis.  They must also have had next-generation sequencing carried out on their tumour, blood samples or bone marrow.   Types of interventions   We will include studies with the following comparisons.   1. Matched  targeted  therapy  versus  standard-of-care  palliative chemotherapy  (such  as  osimertinib,  epidermal  growth  factor receptor  (EGFR)  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  versus  palliative chemotherapy, i.e. carboplatin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation) (Ayeni 2015).   2. Matched  targeted  therapy  in  combination  with  standard-of- care palliative chemotherapy versus standard-of-care palliative treatment  alone  (such  as  FOLFIRI  with  cetuximab  versus FOLFIRI  alone  in  KRAS  wild-type  metastatic  colorectal  cancer) (Heinemann 2021).   3. Matched targeted therapy versus non-matched targeted therapy (such  as  olaparib,  a  poly(adenosine  diphosphate–ribose) polymerase  (PARP)  inhibitor  in  participants  with  castrate resistant prostate cancer who had alteration in BReast CAncer gene  (BRCA)  versus  those  who  had  alterations  in  other prespecified genes) (De Bono 2020).   4. Matched  targeted  therapy  versus  best  supportive  care,  i.e  no   treatment.   Types of outcome measures   Primary outcomes   1. Overall  survival,  defined  as  the  time  from  trial  enrolment  to death from any cause. Survival will be assessed from the time when participants are enrolled in the study   2. Progression-free  survival,  defined  as  the  time  from  trial enrolment to a composite of disease progression and death   Disease  progression  is  determined  in  solid  organ  tumours  by  the Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours  (RECIST)  criteria, which define whether a tumour is measurable on baseline imaging and  require  the  selection  of  \"target  lesions\"  –  index  lesions  for measuring disease and monitoring response (Eisenhauer 2009). For   people  with  RECIST-measurable  disease,  tumour  measurements on  repeat  imaging  are  separated  into  four  categories:  complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (PR; decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions by at least 30%), progressive  disease  (PD;  increase  in  sum  of  diameters  of  target lesions by at least 20%, or appearance of a new lesion), or stable disease  (SD;  none  of  the  above).  We  will  describe  discrepancies from RECIST criteria qualitatively.   (Cheson  2014));  chronic   Comparable criteria defining CR, PR, SD and PD response categories are  used  in  the  context  of  haematological  malignancies,  as determined  by  disease-specific  response  criteria,  for:  lymphoma (the  Lugano  criteria lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (the international workshop on CLL criteria (Hallek 2018)); acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (the European Leukaemia Net  criteria  (Döhner  2010));  myelodysplastic  syndrome  and myeloproliferative syndromes (the International Working Group's response  criteria  (Savona  2015));  myeloma  (the  International Working  Group  response  criteria  (De  Larrea  2013)).  This  enables progression-free survival to be used as an appropriate endpoint.   Search methods for identification of studies   Electronic searches   We  will  search  the  following  electronic  databases.  The  MEDLINE search strategy is presented in Appendix 1 .   1. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; latest   issue), in the Cochrane Library; 2. MEDLINE via Ovid (2000 to present); 3. Embase via Ovid (2000 to present).   Searching other resources   All  relevant  articles  will  be  identified  on  PubMed  and  we  will conduct  a  further  search  for  newly  published  articles  using  the 'related articles' feature.   Unpublished and grey literature   We will search the following for ongoing trials.   page/mrct).   1. ISRCTN  -  metaRegister  of  Controlled  Trials  (www.isrctn.com/   1. Overall response rate, defined as the percentage of people who   response   (DOR),  defined  as   achieved either a complete response or partial response time   from documentation  of  disease  response  (CR,  PR)  to  disease progression  (PD).  We  plan  to  only  analyse  DOR  separately if  progression-free  survival  has  not  been  reported  or  it  was specifically reported in cancer types such as multiple myeloma 3. Severe adverse events: classified according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NIH 2017)  or  other  established  criteria,  including  percentage  of treatment-related  deaths.  These  guidelines  provide  objective criteria  to  grade  common  adverse  events  from  grade  1  (mild effects,  often  asymptomatic  or  minimally  symptomatic)  to grade 5 (death related to adverse event). We will measure the incidence of grade 3/4/5 toxicity overall (where available), rash, diarrhoea,  and  neutropenia,  as  these  are  known  side  effects of targeted therapies  and chemotherapy/best supportive care. Toxicity will be categorised as follows. a. Haematological: i. anaemia; ii. thrombocytopenia; iii. neutropenia. b. Non-haematological:   i. gastrointestinal  (nausea,  vomiting,  anorexia,  diarrhoea,   liver, proctitis); ii. genitourinary; iii. skin (dermatitis, stomatitis, mucositis, alopecia, allergy); iv. neurological (peripheral and central); v. respiratory; vi. fatigue.   4. Quality  of  life:  measured  using  health-related  quality-of-life questionnaires,  such  as  the  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer Therapy-Generic (FACT-G), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), and any other instrument available (Aaronson 1993; Cella 1993; Kovic 2018).   2. Physicians Data Query (www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq ). 3. ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov). 4. WHO  International  Clinical  Trials  Registry  Platform  (ICTRP)   (www.who.int/ictrp/en/).   these  searches,  we  will  approach   If  ongoing  studies  that  have  not  been  published  are  identified through the  principal investigators, and major co-operative groups active in this area, to ask for relevant data. We will also search conference proceedings and  abstracts  (e.g.  ZETOC  (zetoc.mimas.ac.uk)  and  WorldCat Dissertations.   We  will  handsearch  the  citation  lists  of  included  studies,  key textbooks, and previous systematic reviews, and contact experts in the field, to identify further reports of trials. We will also handsearch the reports of conferences from the following sources.   1. Annual Congress of the European Haematology Association. 2. Annual  Scientific  Meeting  of  the  American  Society  of   3. British Journal of Cancer. 4. British Cancer Research Meeting. 5. Annual  Meeting  of  European  Society  of  Medical  Oncology   6. Annual  Meeting  of  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology   7. Journal of Clinical Oncology. 8. Annals of Oncology. 9. The Lancet Oncology.   Data collection and analysis   Selection of studies   We  will  download  all  titles  and  abstracts  retrieved  by  electronic searching  to  a  reference  management  database  (Covidence)  and remove  duplicates.  Two  review  authors  (FK/TF)  will  examine  the remaining references independently. We will exclude those studies   that  clearly  do  not  meet  the  inclusion  criteria,  and  obtain  copies of  the  full  text  of  potentially  relevant  references.  Independently, three  review  authors  (TF,  PH  and  SL)  will  assess  the  eligibility  of the retrieved reports/publications in duplicate. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third  person  (SB).  We  will  identify  and  exclude  duplicate  reports and collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather  than  each  report,  is  the  unit  of  interest  in  the  review.  We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA  flow  diagram  and  a  'Characteristics  of  excluded  studies' table (Liberati 2009).   Three review authors (FA, TF, SB) will independently extract data from the reports of included studies, resolving any discrepancies via consensus. Data will be collected in duplicate in piloted forms and stored on an online repository. Data to be collected will include the following.   1. Author,  year  of  publication  and  journal  citation  (including   language).   2. Country. 3. Setting. 4. Inclusion and exclusion criteria. 5. Study design, methodology. 6. Participant demographics and characteristics (such as gender, median  age,  comorbidities  and  performance  status);  total number enrolled.   7. Cancer type (solid/haematological). 8. Intervention:  drug  name,  FDA/EMA  licenced  (yes/no),  method of  administration (oral/systemic)  and  dose,  mechanism of  action  (small  molecules/monoclonal  antibody/antibody- drug  conjugates),  schedule  of  administration  (daily/weekly/ monthly),  number  of  participants the randomised intervention arm, concurrent chemotherapy (yes/no).   9. Control:  chemotherapy/  non-matched  targeted  therapy/  no treatment,  dose,  schedule  of  administration  (daily/weekly/ monthly),  number  of  participants  randomised  to  the  control arm.   interest.   12.Outcomes:  primary  and  secondary  outcomes  specified  and   collected, and time points reported.   Where  data  from  the  same  trial  are  presented  in  multiple publications, we will extract all of the information and report this as a single trial whilst listing the other publications in the references. We  will  note  the  time  points  at  which  trials  are  collected  and outcomes are reported.   We  will  assess  and  report  on  the  methodological  risk  of  bias of  included  studies  in  accordance  with  the  Cochrane  Handbook for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2021),  which recommends  the  explicit  reporting  of  the  following  individual elements for RCTs.   2. Bias due to deviations from intended interventions; 3. Bias due to missing outcome data; 4. Bias in the measurement of the outcome; 5. Bias in selection of the reported result.   For non-randomised studies, we will  use the Risk of Bias  in  Non- randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) assessment tool to assess bias due to confounding, participant selection, classification of  interventions,  deviation  from  intended  interventions,  missing data,  outcome  measurement  and  reporting  of  results  (Sterne 2016). Key confounders include: staging of underlying relapsed or metastatic cancer; and presence of comorbidities.   Two  review  authors  (TF,  BH)  will  apply  the  'Risk  of  bias'  tool independently and resolve differences by discussion or by appeal to a third review author (FK). We will judge each item as being at high, low or unclear risk of bias, as set out in the criteria provided by Higgins 2021. We will provide a quote from the study report or a statement as justification for the judgement for each item in the 'Risk of bias' table. We will summarise results in both a 'Risk of bias' graph and a 'Risk of bias' summary.   We  will  report  a  study  to  be  at  low  risk  of  bias  overall  for  the outcome when the study is judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains  for  this  outcome.  We  will  report  a  study  to  have  some concerns overall for the outcome when the study is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain for this outcome, but not to be  at  high  risk  of  bias  for  any  domain.  Similarly  we  will  report  a study to be at high risk of bias overall when study is judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain for this outcome or the study is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the result (Higgins 2021).   When  interpreting  treatment  effects  and  meta-analyses,  we  will take  into  account  the  risk  of  bias  for  the  studies  that  contribute to  that  outcome.  Where  information  on  risk  of  bias  relates  to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the 'Risk of bias' table (Appendix 2).   Measures of treatment effect   We will use the hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the measure of effect for the following time-to-event outcomes.   1. Overall survival. 2. Progression-free survival. 3. Duration of response.   If  the  hazard  ratio  is  not  reported  for  these  outcomes,  we  will estimate  it  from  other  available  statistics,  such  as  response  rate and  toxicity,  and  exact  log  rank  P  value  from  Kaplan  Meier  plot logrank test, with rates of toxicity reported in percentage form only converted  to  numerators  by  taking  the  denominator  as  the  total number evaluated for safety and rounding the resultant conversion to the nearest integer (Parmar 1998; Tierney  2007).   We will use risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs as the measure of effect for the following dichotomous outcomes.   1. Overall response rates: complete response (CR) (incidence over total number evaluated), partial response (PR) (incidence over total number evaluated) and stable disease (SD) (incidence over total number evaluated).   2. Toxicity: incidence of grade 3/4/5 toxicity (as noted above) for   haematological and non-haematological toxicities.   We  will  use  mean  difference  (MD)  and  standard  deviation  (SD) to  report  quality  of  life  with  continuous  scales  of  measurement. We  will  standardise  and  combine  data  where  different  studies used different measurement scales (i.e. using standardised mean difference (SMD)) and SD.   Similarly,  If  the  same  outcome  is  reported  in  some  studies  as dichotomous and in other studies as continuous then we will re- express the odds ratio as the SMD. This method assumes logistic distribution and comparable variability for both intervention and control groups according to the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2021).   The  unit  of  analysis  will  be  the  individual  participant.  The  only unit of analysis issues we may encounter will arise from trials that have multiple intervention arms. Where possible, we will use the summary hazard ratio (from a comparison of the combined arms versus  the  control  arm)  for  meta-analysis.  If  this  is  not  available, we  will  use  random  effects  meta-analysis  to  combine  the  hazard ratios reported for separate groups but will halve the control group in each case to avoid double-counting.   Cluster-randomised trials and cross-over trial designs are unlikely to be used for trials of this therapy, but are technically eligible for inclusion. We will only pool data from cluster-RCTs if the available data have been adjusted (or can be adjusted), to account for the clustering. For cross-over trials, we will only use data from the first phase (i.e. before cross-over) to minimise potential bias from carry- over effects (Higgins 2021).   We will contact study authors to obtain missing data (participant, outcome,  or  summary  data).  Regarding  missing  individuals  from studies,  we  will  conduct  our  analysis  on  an  intention-to-treat principle; otherwise data will be analysed as reported. We will not impute missing data for any of the outcomes.   Where  studies  are  considered  similar  enough  based  on consideration  of  populations  and  interventions  to  allow  pooling of  data  using  meta-analysis,  we  will  assess  the  degree  of heterogeneity  by  visual  inspection  of  forest  plots  (Deeks  2001; Higgins 2003) and quantify heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, as follows.   1. 0% to 40%: might not be important. 2. 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity. 3. 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity. 4. 75% to 100%: represents considerable heterogeneity.   If  there  is  evidence  of  substantial  clinical,  methodological  or statistical  heterogeneity  across  included  studies,  we  will  explore the  possible  sources  (for  example,  differences  in  participants  or interventions).   We will investigate publication bias by visual assessment of funnel plots for the primary outcome if more than 10 studies are included.   Data synthesis   We  expect  that  the  studies  included  in  this  review  will  be heterogenous  due  to  multiple  treatment  arms.  We  will  therefore pool the results from the studies using the random-effects model with  inverse  variance  (DeSimonian  1986)  in  Review  Manager  5 (Review Manager 2020).   For dichotomous and continuous outcomes, we will consider only outcomes reported within 12 months' follow-up in our review.   1. For any dichotomous outcomes (overall response rate, rates of toxicity, adverse events), we will calculate the risk ratio (RR) for each study and these will then be pooled.   2. For  continuous  outcomes  (quality-of-life  questionnaires),  we will  pool  the  mean  differences  (MDs)  between  the  treatment arms at the end of follow-up, if all trials measure the outcome on the same scale; otherwise we will pool standardised mean differences (SMDs).   3. For  time-to-event  data  (overall  survival  and  progression-free survival),  we  will  pool  hazard  ratios  using  the  generic  inverse variance facility in Review Manager 5.   If  any  trials  have  multiple  treatment  groups,  we  will  divide  the ‘shared’  comparison  group  into  the  number  of  treatment  groups and treat the split comparison group as independent comparisons. If  we  are  unable  to  pool  data  statistically  using  meta-analysis, we  will  conduct  a  narrative  synthesis  of  results  adhering  to  the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guideline (Campbell 2020). We will present the major outcomes and results, organised by type of advanced cancer: solid versus haematological cancers. We will then present data from studies in a forest plot without the pooled effect estimate.   Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity   We will perform subgroup analyses in Review Manager, using the formal test for subgroup differences, for the following factors.   1. Type of advanced cancer: solid versus haematological cancers. 2. Previously  approved  therapies:  targeted  therapies  that  have been  previously  licensed  for  other  cancer  types  (i.e.  EMA/FDA approval) versus those that have not.   3. Agent  class:  matched  targeted  therapy  (i.e.  monoclonal antibodies/small  molecules/antibody-drug  conjugates)  versus cytotoxic (i.e. chemotherapy).   4. Adverse  effects:  The  presence  of  grade  3  and  above  toxicities versus  those  that  have  not.  This  will  only  be  conducted  for adverse effect outcomes.   We  will  consider  the  P  value  from  the  test  for  subgroup differences  to  determine  whether  these  factors  significantly modify  the  treatment  effect.  We  will  also  record  whether  the treatment effects for each subgroup favour the same treatment or different  treatment,  and  the  extent  of  heterogeneity  within  each subgroup (Richardson 2019).   Sensitivity  analyses  will  be  conducted  to  investigate  the  impact of  excluding  trials  at  high  risk  of  bias.  Where  our  investigations for heterogeneity identify one study as being the likely sole cause of  heterogeneity,  we  will  conduct  sensitivity  analyses    to  see whether the reported result in the pooled analysis changes after the exclusion of the study.   We  will  present  a  'Summary  of  findings'  table  for  the  following comparisons (see Appendix 3).   1. Matched  targeted  therapy  versus  standard-of-care  palliative   chemotherapy.   2. Matched  targeted  therapy  in  combination  with  chemotherapy   versus standard-of-care palliative chemotherapy.   3. Matched  targeted  therapy  versus  non-matched  targeted   therapy.   4. Matched  targeted  therapy  versus  best  supportive  care,  i.e  no   treatment.   The  table  will  report  the  following  outcomes  (listed  in  order  of priority) for the comparisons listed above.   1. Overall survival. 2. Overall response rate. 3. Overall grade 3/4/5 toxicity. 4. Overall grade 3/4/5 haematological toxicity. 5. Overall grade 3/4/5 non-haematological toxicity. 6. Quality of life, reported using Functional Assessment of Cancer   We  will  present  the  overall  certainty  of  the  evidence  for each  outcome  according  to  the  Grading  of  Recommendations Assessment,  Development  and  Evaluation  (GRADE)  approach, which  takes  into  account  the  risk  of  bias,  consistency  of  effect, imprecision,  indirectness  and  publication  bias  (Granholm  2019; Schünemann  2021).  We  will  use  the  methods  described  in  the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2021);  GRADEPro  GDT  will  be  used  to  create  the  tables.  We  will use the GRADE checklist and GRADE Working Group definitions of the certainty of evidence, as follows (Higgins 2021; Santesso 2020; Schünemann 2021).   1. High  certainty:  we  are  very  confident  that  the  true  effect  lies   close to that of the estimate of the effect.   2. Moderate  certainty:  we  are  moderately  confident  in  the  effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. 3. Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.   4. Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate.  The  true  effect  is  likely  to  be  substantially  different from the estimate of effect.   GRADE assessments will be undertaken by two independent review authors (PH and TF). Where the evidence is based on single studies, or where there is no evidence on a specific outcome, we will include the  outcome  in  the  'Summary  of  findings'  table,  and  grade  or explain accordingly. We will justify and document all assessments of  the  certainty  of  the  body  of  evidence  (e.g.  downgrading  or upgrading  using  GRADE).  We  will  downgrade  the  evidence  from 'high' certainty by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) concerns  for  each  limitation,  and  we  will  note  the  basis  of  our judgement  in  the  table  footnotes.  We  will  interpret  the  results of  graded  evidence  based  on  Cochrane  Effective  Practice  and Organisation of Care guidance (EPOC 2017).

         "BACKGROUND\nEsophageal atresia is one of the most common life-threatening congenital malformations and is defined as an interruption in the continuity of the esophagus with or without fistula to the trachea or bronchi. Definitive treatment is surgical ligation of the fistula if present and esophageal end-to-end anastomosis of the two pouches, thereby reconstructing the continuity of the esophagus. During this procedure, the surgeon may choose to either ligate or preserve the azygos vein, a major draining vein for the esophagus and surrounding structures, but no definitive consensus on the matter exists.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the benefits and harms of preservation of the azygos vein versus ligation of the azygos vein during primary surgical repair of congenital esophageal atresia.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe identified trials from the Cochrane Gut Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews Database (EBMR), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We searched all databases from their inception to 22 May 2024, with no restriction on language of publication.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing preservation of the azygos vein versus ligation of the azygos vein during primary surgical repair of congenital esophageal atresia in infants less than three months of age.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nPairs of two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, screened relevant full-text reports, and identified RCTs for inclusion. We recorded the selection process in a PRISMA flow diagram. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies (using RoB 2) and the certainty of the evidence (using the GRADE approach) according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We contacted the study authors if data were missing or unclear.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nSix trials met the inclusion criteria, including 390 participants in total. We were able to assess all our primary outcomes: all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and anastomosis leakage, as well as two of our three secondary outcomes: sepsis or mediastinitis and esophageal stricture. However, none of the six trials assessed recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula. All trials had either some concerns or high risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was either low or very low. Meta-analyses showed that preservation of the azygos vein may result in a large reduction in mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.73; low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.50; very low-certainty evidence), and anastomosis leakage (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.76; low-certainty evidence) when compared to ligation of the azygos vein in neonates undergoing primary surgical repair of congenital esophageal atresia. Meta-analysis of our secondary outcomes showed that preservation of the azygos vein may result in a large reduction in mediastinitis or sepsis (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.53; very low-certainty evidence). Esophageal stricture was only reported in two studies with 114 participants. The effects on esophageal stricture were unclear (RR 0.75, 96% CI 0.35 to 1.63; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nCurrent evidence suggests that preserving the azygos vein during primary surgical repair for esophageal atresia may result in large reductions in overall mortality, serious adverse events, anastomosis leakage, and sepsis or mediastinitis. No included data suggested that routine ligation of the azygos vein was beneficial. However, all the evidence was of low to very low certainty. Further research is still warranted as the results of this review may not be applicable to all newborns with congenital esophageal atresia.",

It is generally defined as an interruption\nin  the  continuity  of  the  esophagus  with  or  without  fistula  to  the\ntrachea or bronchi (Spitz 2007).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nVarious  classification  systems  for  esophageal  atresia  exist  based\non  the  presence  and  type  of  fistula.  The  most  commonly  used\nclassification  systems  for  esophageal  atresia  were  suggested\nby  Vogt  1929  and  Gross  1953,  dividing  the  malformation  into  six\nor five subtypes, respectively. Despite many anatomical variations,\nmost children (approximately 85%) have esophageal atresia with a\ndistal tracheoesophageal fistula (Gross type C) (Gross 1953; Kluth\n1976; Spitz 2007).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nInternational  surveillance  programs  and  recent  observational\nstudies (from China, Europe, and the USA) have found an overall\nprevalence  of  esophageal  atresia  of  2.4  per  10,000  births,  with\nregional differences ranging from 0.2 to 4.6 per 10,000 (Lupo 2017;\nNassar  2012;  Oddsberg  2012;  Pedersen  2012;  Schmedding  2021;\nWittekindt  2019;  Zhou  2020).  Although  there  is  variation  in  the\nreported  prevalence,  several  European  studies  suggest  that  the\nprevalence appears to be stable over time (Cassina 2016; Oddsberg\n2010; Pedersen 2012). The malformation is most common in males,\nwith a male: female ratio of 1:0.74 (Pedersen 2012).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAt birth, the child presents with typical drooling of saliva, inability\nto  swallow,  choking,  coughing,  cyanotic  attacks  (skin  appearing\nblue  due  to  poor  circulation  or  inadequate  blood  oxygenation),\nand  possibly  a  distended  abdomen,  depending  on  the  type  of\nfistula (Höllwarth 2020). The diagnosis is then usually made by the\ninability  to  pass  a  feeding  tube  into  the  stomach,  followed  by  a\nplain X-ray of the thorax/abdomen (Höllwarth 2020; Morini 2020).\nMost  children  with  esophageal  atresia  are  diagnosed  after  birth,\nalthough  prenatal  diagnostics  have  improved  from  26%  to  36%\nover  the  last  30  years  (Pedersen  2012).  The  postnatal  diagnosis\noccurs at birth in 83.4% of children with esophageal atresia, within\nthe first week in 15.4% of the children, and after the first week of life\nin only 1.2% of children (Pedersen 2012).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe  exact  etiology  is  still  obscure  (Felix  2009;  Harmon  2012).\nAs  most  cases  occur  sporadically,  the  etiology  is  likely  to\nbe  multifactorial,  involving  multiple  genes  and  complex  gene-\nenvironment interactions (Felix 2009 Harmon 2012). Observational\ninfectious\nstudies  suggest\ndiseases, teratogens (e.g., thalidomide), statins, alcohol, smoking,\ncontraceptive  pills,  hormones,  maternal  diabetes,  high  maternal\nage,  and  assisted  pregnancy  (Felix  2009;  Källén  2010;  Oddsberg\n2010).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nfactors  may\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.4**r== 0.6**\ninclude\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs  it  is  an  early  organogenesis  defect,  people  with  esophageal\natresia have a high frequency of associated anomalies (40 to 80%)\n(Oddsberg 2012; Pedersen 2012; Sfeir 2013; Stoll 2009; van Heurn\n2002).  Recent  observational  studies  have  found  that  esophageal\natresia  was  isolated  in  45  to  53%  of  cases,  32  to  47%  had\nmultiple anomalies, and 23.7% had an association or a syndrome\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n(Pedersen  2012;  Stoll  2017).  The  most  commonly  associated\nanomalies  are  congenital  heart  defects  (23  to  29%  of  children\nwith  esophageal  atresia),  other  gastrointestinal  anomalies  (16  to\n21%),  urinary  tract  anomalies  (15  to  16%),  and  limb  anomalies\n(13  to  14%)  (Pedersen  2012;  Stoll  2017).  Up  to  10%  of  people\nwith  esophageal  atresia  have  a  nonrandom  VACTERL  association\ninvolving  a  spectrum  of  abnormalities  (vertebral,  anorectal,\ncardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb) (Pedersen 2012; Stoll\n2017).  Other  associations  that  may  include  esophageal  atresia\nare  the  CHARGE  association,  Feingold  syndrome,  Anophthalmia-\nEsophageal-Genital (AEG) syndrome, PallisterHall syndrome, Opitz\nG  syndrome,  X-linked  Opitz  syndrome,  Edwards  syndrome,\nDowns  syndrome,  and  other  chromosomal  or  non-chromosomal\nsyndromes (Brosens 2014; Pedersen 2012; Spitz 2007; Stoll 2017).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nPrognosis\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nUntreated,  the  child  succumbs  to  starvation,  infections,  and\nrespiratory complication (Höllwarth 2020; Spitz 2007). Survival thus\ndepends  on  surgical  correction.  If  surgery  is  delayed,  prolonged\ntotal  parenteral  nutrition  or  gastrostomy  can  be  necessary  (Patel\n2002).  Esophageal  atresia  is  still  associated  with  increased\nmortality (Cassina 2016; Choudhury 1999; Lilja 2008; Schmedding\n2021;  Sfeir  2013;  Zimmer  2019).  The  mortality  rate  for  newborns\nwith  isolated  esophageal  atresia  ranges  from  4.3%  to  8.1%\n(Pedersen  2012;  Zhou  2020).  The  mortality  rate  increases  with\nthe  presence  of  associated  abnormalities:  to  13.5%  in  children\nwith  VACTERL  association,  23  to  36%  for  newborns  with  heart\ndefects, and 88.5% for children with Edwards syndrome (Pedersen\n2012; Wittekindt 2019; Zhou 2020). The influences of major cardiac\nand  chromosomal  anomalies  are  among  the  most  important\npredictors of death and complications, which warrants the need for\nechocardiography examination and genetic testing in people with\nesophageal atresia (Cassina 2016; Choudhury 1999; Pedersen 2012;\nTan 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nEven after surgical correction, there is an increased mortality risk\n(Tan 2019). In a recent study of 650 people with esophageal atresia\nin Australia, 22 (3.8%) died after discharge from the hospital (Tan\n2019).  Similar  findings  were  reported  in  another  study,  with  17\n(7.1%) late deaths, defined as death occurring more than 30 days\nafter birth out of 240 people (Choudhury 1999). These late deaths\nwere  primarily  due  to  respiratory  compromise,  including  sudden\ninfant death, aspiration, tracheomalacia (a condition in which the\ncartilage of the trachea is misshapen, leading to airway collapse),\nand reactive airway disease (Choudhury 1999; Tan 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nComplications\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nEarly complications\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nCommon  complications  during  the  postoperative  period  include\nesophageal  anastomosis  leak,  fistula  recurrence,  anastomotic\nstrictures,  respiratory  complications,  and  infections  (Acher  2016;\nHarmsen  2017;  Nurminen  2019;  Rayyan  2015).  Anastomotic  leaks\noccur  in  5%  to  17%  of  children  undergoing  surgery  (Allin  2014;\nChittmittrapap 1992; Zimmer 2019), representing one of the most\ncommon  serious  complications.  Anastomotic  leakage  into  the\nmediastinum  can  result  from  the  small,  friable  lower  segment,\nuse of prosthetic materials, anastomotic tension, ischemia of the\nesophageal ends, sepsis, and relatively long distance between the\nupper  and  lower  esophageal  segment  (Lal  2018;  Teague  2016;\nUpadhyaya  2007).

This  makes\nstrictures the main complication after surgical repair of esophageal\natresia (Zimmer 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nChildren  with  esophageal  atresia  have  an  inherent  disorder  in\nesophageal motility and peristalsis, leading to feeding difficulties\nsuch  as  delayed  esophageal  clearance,  gastroesophageal  reflux,\nand  dysphagia  (Faure  2017 Sistonen  2010).  Symptoms  of  feeding\ndifficulties  have  been  reported  in  up  to  80%  of  people  with\nesophageal atresia in follow-up studies (Acher 2016; Gibreel 2017).\nA  recent  review  demonstrated  that  22%  to  63%  of  children\nwith  esophageal  atresia  are  affected  by  gastroesophageal  reflux\n(Krishnan  2016).  The  esophageal  repair  plays  a  significant  role\nin  the  etiology  of  reflux  that  may  displace  the  gastroesophageal\njunction  upward  due  to  esophageal  shortening  (Krishnan  2016).\nOther  possible  etiologies  for  feeding  difficulties  include  delayed\nfeeding  skills  and  behavioral  factors,  esophageal  strictures,\ntracheomalacia due to malformation of the cartilage, or abnormal\ngastric function (Duvoisin 2017; Mahoney 2016; Puntis 1990).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTreatment  of  the  esophageal  atresia  consists  of  surgical\nreconstruction of the continuity of the esophagus. This is achieved\nby performing an end-to-end anastomosis between the esophageal\nsegments  and,  if  present,  ligation  and  division  of  the  fistula\n(Höllwarth  2020).  With  increasing  overall  treatment  success,  the\ngoal  of  surgical  management  of  esophageal  atresia  has  shifted\nfrom  pure  survival  towards  minimizing  postoperative  morbidity\n(Dingemann 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDifferent  surgical  techniques  may  be  used,  and  the  choice  of\noperative  approach  depends  on  the  specific  type  of  esophageal\natresia, the occurrence of associated anomalies, expertise present,\nand the clinical state of the newborn (Lal 2013). An international\nsurvey  investigation  showed  considerable  variability  in  surgical\npractice  and  postoperative  management  among  hospitals  and\ninstitutes (Lal 2013). There is thus no consensus on the best surgical\napproach; open or thoracoscopic techniques are equally used, but\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthe  use  of  the  thoracoscopic  approach  seems  to  be  increasing\n(Dingemann  2020;  Lal  2013).  The  thoracoscopic  approach  is  less\ninvasive, and preliminary studies have shown that it seems to be as\neffective as open surgery in terms of operating time, postoperative\ncare, leaks, and strictures (Borruto 2012; Lal 2013).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\nlong-gap  esophageal  atresia\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTreatment  of  children  with\nis\nconsidered  more  challenging  and  requires  staged  repair  (Foker\n1997).  Management  of  long-gap  esophageal  atresia  includes\nesophageal  myotomy  (circular  or  spiral),  lengthening  or  traction\ntechniques,  esophagus  replacement  by  gastric  transposition,\nor  intestinal  interposition  (Baird  2019;  Bairdain  2015;  Foker\n1997).  To  allow  for  growth  of  the  esophageal  pouches,  delayed\nrepair  (six  weeks  to  months)  is,  therefore,  often  a  part  of  the\nstrategy,  prompting  the  need  for  prolonged  parental  nutrition  or\ngastrostomy (Patel 2002).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nRegardless  of  the  surgical  approach  taken,  the  azygos  vein  is\ntraditionally divided early during surgery to facilitate dissection of\nthe  anatomical  structure  and  to  ease  identification  of  the  vagus\nnerve, the distal esophagus pouch, and the fistula (Harmon 2012;\nSpitz 2007). However, in recent years, it has been hypothesized that\npreservation of the azygos vein might maintain mediastinal venous\ndrainage  and  thereby  decrease  the  number  of  postoperative\ncomplications,  including  anastomotic  leakage  (Cui  2020;  Sharma\n2007).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe  azygos  vein  drains  a  considerable  amount  of  deoxygenated\nblood from the esophagus, the posterior wall of the thorax, and the\nabdomen  towards  the  superior  vena  cava  vein  (Grays  2015).  The\nanatomy of the azygos vein can be variable, but it usually starts at\nthe level of the lumbar vertebrae and unites the ascending lumbar\nveins  with  the  right  subcostal  veins.  As  it  ascends  in  the  thorax\nrunning to the right of the esophagus, it is joined by the intercostal\nveins, the hemiazygos vein, and the bronchial veins, before arching\nover the right main bronchus to join the superior cava vein (Grays\n2015). Importantly, the azygos vein also drains the esophageal veins\nof the thoracic part of the esophagus, as these veins only to a lesser\nextent drain into the intercostal and bronchial veins (Grays 2015).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nHow the intervention might work\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs  the  azygos  is  a  major  draining  vein  for  the  esophageal  and\nbronchial  veins,  as  well  as  the  viscera  within  the  mediastinum\n(Grays 2015), its preservation during surgery might have beneficial\neffects  on  postsurgical  venous  drainage,  and  thereby  decrease\npostoperative  congestion  and  tissue  edema  (Cui  2020).  This  may\nultimately  promote  healing,  as  the  diffusion  of  oxygen  and  other\nnutrients improves in the absence of congestion and tissue edema\nformation  (Scallan  2010).  This,  in  turn,  has  been  hypothesized\nto  decrease  the  risk  of  anastomotic  leak,  esophageal  stricture,\nand potentially even decrease the risk of tracheal and pulmonary\ncomplications (Sharma 2007; Upadhyaya 2007). Furthermore, the\npreservation  of  the  azygos  vein  has  been  proposed  to  prevent\nfistula  recurrence  by  being  interposed  between  the  anastomosis\nand the fistula stump, thereby using the vein to physically separate\nthe two structures (Patkowsk 2009).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nLigation  of  the  vein  provides  easy  access,  which  might  decrease\nthe  risk  of  damaging  the  nerves  and  blood  vessels  during  the\nsurgical repair (Morrow 2020). Consequently, the choice of surgical\napproach towards the azygos vein may influence both short-term\nand long-term complications and morbidity (Cui 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nPreservation of the azygos vein versus ligation of the azygos vein during primary surgical repair of congenital esophageal atresia\n(Protocol)\nCopyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The objectives are as follows:   To assess the benefits and harms of preservation of the azygos vein versus ligation of the azygos vein during primary surgical repair of congenital esophageal atresia.   Esophageal  atresia  is  one  of  the  most  common  life-threatening congenital malformations. It is generally defined as an interruption in  the  continuity  of  the  esophagus  with  or  without  fistula  to  the trachea or bronchi (Spitz 2007).   Various  classification  systems  for  esophageal  atresia  exist  based on  the  presence  and  type  of  fistula.  The  most  commonly  used classification  systems  for  esophageal  atresia  were  suggested by  Vogt  1929  and  Gross  1953,  dividing  the  malformation  into  six or five subtypes, respectively. Despite many anatomical variations, most children (approximately 85%) have esophageal atresia with a distal tracheoesophageal fistula (Gross type C) (Gross 1953; Kluth 1976; Spitz 2007).   International  surveillance  programs  and  recent  observational studies (from China, Europe, and the USA) have found an overall prevalence  of  esophageal  atresia  of  2.4  per  10,000  births,  with regional differences ranging from 0.2 to 4.6 per 10,000 (Lupo 2017; Nassar  2012;  Oddsberg  2012;  Pedersen  2012;  Schmedding  2021; Wittekindt  2019;  Zhou  2020).  Although  there  is  variation  in  the reported  prevalence,  several  European  studies  suggest  that  the prevalence appears to be stable over time (Cassina 2016; Oddsberg 2010; Pedersen 2012). The malformation is most common in males, with a male: female ratio of 1:0.74 (Pedersen 2012).   At birth, the child presents with typical drooling of saliva, inability to  swallow,  choking,  coughing,  cyanotic  attacks  (skin  appearing blue  due  to  poor  circulation  or  inadequate  blood  oxygenation), and  possibly  a  distended  abdomen,  depending  on  the  type  of fistula (Höllwarth 2020). The diagnosis is then usually made by the inability  to  pass  a  feeding  tube  into  the  stomach,  followed  by  a plain X-ray of the thorax/abdomen (Höllwarth 2020; Morini 2020). Most  children  with  esophageal  atresia  are  diagnosed  after  birth, although  prenatal  diagnostics  have  improved  from  26%  to  36% over  the  last  30  years  (Pedersen  2012).  The  postnatal  diagnosis occurs at birth in 83.4% of children with esophageal atresia, within the first week in 15.4% of the children, and after the first week of life in only 1.2% of children (Pedersen 2012).   The  exact  etiology  is  still  obscure  (Felix  2009;  Harmon  2012). As  most  cases  occur  sporadically,  the  etiology  is  likely  to be  multifactorial,  involving  multiple  genes  and  complex  gene- environment interactions (Felix 2009 Harmon 2012). Observational infectious studies  suggest diseases, teratogens (e.g., thalidomide), statins, alcohol, smoking, contraceptive  pills,  hormones,  maternal  diabetes,  high  maternal age,  and  assisted  pregnancy  (Felix  2009;  Källén  2010;  Oddsberg 2010).   factors  may   include   As  it  is  an  early  organogenesis  defect,  people  with  esophageal atresia have a high frequency of associated anomalies (40 to 80%) (Oddsberg 2012; Pedersen 2012; Sfeir 2013; Stoll 2009; van Heurn 2002).  Recent  observational  studies  have  found  that  esophageal atresia  was  isolated  in  45  to  53%  of  cases,  32  to  47%  had multiple anomalies, and 23.7% had an association or a syndrome   (Pedersen  2012;  Stoll  2017).  The  most  commonly  associated anomalies  are  congenital  heart  defects  (23  to  29%  of  children with  esophageal  atresia),  other  gastrointestinal  anomalies  (16  to 21%),  urinary  tract  anomalies  (15  to  16%),  and  limb  anomalies (13  to  14%)  (Pedersen  2012;  Stoll  2017).  Up  to  10%  of  people with  esophageal  atresia  have  a  nonrandom  VACTERL  association involving  a  spectrum  of  abnormalities  (vertebral,  anorectal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb) (Pedersen 2012; Stoll 2017).  Other  associations  that  may  include  esophageal  atresia are  the  CHARGE  association,  Feingold  syndrome,  Anophthalmia- Esophageal-Genital (AEG) syndrome, PallisterHall syndrome, Opitz G  syndrome,  X-linked  Opitz  syndrome,  Edwards  syndrome, Downs  syndrome,  and  other  chromosomal  or  non-chromosomal syndromes (Brosens 2014; Pedersen 2012; Spitz 2007; Stoll 2017).   Untreated,  the  child  succumbs  to  starvation,  infections,  and respiratory complication (Höllwarth 2020; Spitz 2007). Survival thus depends  on  surgical  correction.  If  surgery  is  delayed,  prolonged total  parenteral  nutrition  or  gastrostomy  can  be  necessary  (Patel 2002).  Esophageal  atresia  is  still  associated  with  increased mortality (Cassina 2016; Choudhury 1999; Lilja 2008; Schmedding 2021;  Sfeir  2013;  Zimmer  2019).  The  mortality  rate  for  newborns with  isolated  esophageal  atresia  ranges  from  4.3%  to  8.1% (Pedersen  2012;  Zhou  2020).  The  mortality  rate  increases  with the  presence  of  associated  abnormalities:  to  13.5%  in  children with  VACTERL  association,  23  to  36%  for  newborns  with  heart defects, and 88.5% for children with Edwards syndrome (Pedersen 2012; Wittekindt 2019; Zhou 2020). The influences of major cardiac and  chromosomal  anomalies  are  among  the  most  important predictors of death and complications, which warrants the need for echocardiography examination and genetic testing in people with esophageal atresia (Cassina 2016; Choudhury 1999; Pedersen 2012; Tan 2019).   Even after surgical correction, there is an increased mortality risk (Tan 2019). In a recent study of 650 people with esophageal atresia in Australia, 22 (3.8%) died after discharge from the hospital (Tan 2019).  Similar  findings  were  reported  in  another  study,  with  17 (7.1%) late deaths, defined as death occurring more than 30 days after birth out of 240 people (Choudhury 1999). These late deaths were  primarily  due  to  respiratory  compromise,  including  sudden infant death, aspiration, tracheomalacia (a condition in which the cartilage of the trachea is misshapen, leading to airway collapse), and reactive airway disease (Choudhury 1999; Tan 2019).   Early complications   Common  complications  during  the  postoperative  period  include esophageal  anastomosis  leak,  fistula  recurrence,  anastomotic strictures,  respiratory  complications,  and  infections  (Acher  2016; Harmsen  2017;  Nurminen  2019;  Rayyan  2015).  Anastomotic  leaks occur  in  5%  to  17%  of  children  undergoing  surgery  (Allin  2014; Chittmittrapap 1992; Zimmer 2019), representing one of the most common  serious  complications.  Anastomotic  leakage  into  the mediastinum  can  result  from  the  small,  friable  lower  segment, use of prosthetic materials, anastomotic tension, ischemia of the esophageal ends, sepsis, and relatively long distance between the upper  and  lower  esophageal  segment  (Lal  2018;  Teague  2016; Upadhyaya  2007).  Major  leaks  are  rare  and  usually  manifest  with acute  deterioration  associated  with  pneumothorax  and  sepsis,   which  may  require  emergency  chest  tube  decompression  or surgical intervention (Chittmittrapap 1992).   Recurrent  fistula  can  be  life-threatening  and  is  experienced  by about  3%  to  9%  of  people  with  esophageal  atresia  (Allin  2014; Smithers 2017; Zimmer 2019). Treatment by endoscopic injection of glue, trichloroacetic acid, thermal ablation, or an open surgical intervention can be used for occlusion (Meier 2007; Richter 2008).   advancements   in  preoperative,  operative,   Despite and postoperative  management,  the  overall  burden  of  comorbidities and  long-term  complications  influences  quality  of  life  in  both children  and  their  parents,  notably  in  children  with  tracheal and  esophageal  complications  (Ijsselstijn  2013;  Legrand  2012; Rozensztrauch  2019;  Sistonen  2011;  Witt  2019a;  Witt  2019b). After  surgical  repair,  children  are  at  risk  of  late  complications such  as  strictures  of  the  anastomotic  region,  gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, tracheomalacia, feeding difficulties, pulmonary symptoms,  and  developmental  challenges  (Acher  2016;  Harmsen 2017; Morini 2018; Nurminen 2019; Rayyan 2015).   Reported  rates  of  esophageal  strictures  vary  from  25%  to  75%, occurring  early  postsurgically  or  later  in  childhood  (Allin  2014; Friedmacher  2017;  Koivusalo  2013;  Zimmer  2019).  This  makes strictures the main complication after surgical repair of esophageal atresia (Zimmer 2019).   Children  with  esophageal  atresia  have  an  inherent  disorder  in esophageal motility and peristalsis, leading to feeding difficulties such  as  delayed  esophageal  clearance,  gastroesophageal  reflux, and  dysphagia  (Faure  2017 Sistonen  2010).  Symptoms  of  feeding difficulties  have  been  reported  in  up  to  80%  of  people  with esophageal atresia in follow-up studies (Acher 2016; Gibreel 2017). A  recent  review  demonstrated  that  22%  to  63%  of  children with  esophageal  atresia  are  affected  by  gastroesophageal  reflux (Krishnan  2016).  The  esophageal  repair  plays  a  significant  role in  the  etiology  of  reflux  that  may  displace  the  gastroesophageal junction  upward  due  to  esophageal  shortening  (Krishnan  2016). Other  possible  etiologies  for  feeding  difficulties  include  delayed feeding  skills  and  behavioral  factors,  esophageal  strictures, tracheomalacia due to malformation of the cartilage, or abnormal gastric function (Duvoisin 2017; Mahoney 2016; Puntis 1990).   Treatment  of  the  esophageal  atresia  consists  of  surgical reconstruction of the continuity of the esophagus. This is achieved by performing an end-to-end anastomosis between the esophageal segments  and,  if  present,  ligation  and  division  of  the  fistula (Höllwarth  2020).  With  increasing  overall  treatment  success,  the goal  of  surgical  management  of  esophageal  atresia  has  shifted from  pure  survival  towards  minimizing  postoperative  morbidity (Dingemann 2020).   Different  surgical  techniques  may  be  used,  and  the  choice  of operative  approach  depends  on  the  specific  type  of  esophageal atresia, the occurrence of associated anomalies, expertise present, and the clinical state of the newborn (Lal 2013). An international survey  investigation  showed  considerable  variability  in  surgical practice  and  postoperative  management  among  hospitals  and institutes (Lal 2013). There is thus no consensus on the best surgical approach; open or thoracoscopic techniques are equally used, but   the  use  of  the  thoracoscopic  approach  seems  to  be  increasing (Dingemann  2020;  Lal  2013).  The  thoracoscopic  approach  is  less invasive, and preliminary studies have shown that it seems to be as effective as open surgery in terms of operating time, postoperative care, leaks, and strictures (Borruto 2012; Lal 2013).   long-gap  esophageal  atresia   Treatment  of  children  with is considered  more  challenging  and  requires  staged  repair  (Foker 1997).  Management  of  long-gap  esophageal  atresia  includes esophageal  myotomy  (circular  or  spiral),  lengthening  or  traction techniques,  esophagus  replacement  by  gastric  transposition, or  intestinal  interposition  (Baird  2019;  Bairdain  2015;  Foker 1997).  To  allow  for  growth  of  the  esophageal  pouches,  delayed repair  (six  weeks  to  months)  is,  therefore,  often  a  part  of  the strategy,  prompting  the  need  for  prolonged  parental  nutrition  or gastrostomy (Patel 2002).   Regardless  of  the  surgical  approach  taken,  the  azygos  vein  is traditionally divided early during surgery to facilitate dissection of the  anatomical  structure  and  to  ease  identification  of  the  vagus nerve, the distal esophagus pouch, and the fistula (Harmon 2012; Spitz 2007). However, in recent years, it has been hypothesized that preservation of the azygos vein might maintain mediastinal venous drainage  and  thereby  decrease  the  number  of  postoperative complications,  including  anastomotic  leakage  (Cui  2020;  Sharma 2007).   The  azygos  vein  drains  a  considerable  amount  of  deoxygenated blood from the esophagus, the posterior wall of the thorax, and the abdomen  towards  the  superior  vena  cava  vein  (Grays  2015).  The anatomy of the azygos vein can be variable, but it usually starts at the level of the lumbar vertebrae and unites the ascending lumbar veins  with  the  right  subcostal  veins.  As  it  ascends  in  the  thorax running to the right of the esophagus, it is joined by the intercostal veins, the hemiazygos vein, and the bronchial veins, before arching over the right main bronchus to join the superior cava vein (Grays 2015). Importantly, the azygos vein also drains the esophageal veins of the thoracic part of the esophagus, as these veins only to a lesser extent drain into the intercostal and bronchial veins (Grays 2015).   How the intervention might work   As  the  azygos  is  a  major  draining  vein  for  the  esophageal  and bronchial  veins,  as  well  as  the  viscera  within  the  mediastinum (Grays 2015), its preservation during surgery might have beneficial effects  on  postsurgical  venous  drainage,  and  thereby  decrease postoperative  congestion  and  tissue  edema  (Cui  2020).  This  may ultimately  promote  healing,  as  the  diffusion  of  oxygen  and  other nutrients improves in the absence of congestion and tissue edema formation  (Scallan  2010).  This,  in  turn,  has  been  hypothesized to  decrease  the  risk  of  anastomotic  leak,  esophageal  stricture, and potentially even decrease the risk of tracheal and pulmonary complications (Sharma 2007; Upadhyaya 2007). Furthermore, the preservation  of  the  azygos  vein  has  been  proposed  to  prevent fistula  recurrence  by  being  interposed  between  the  anastomosis and the fistula stump, thereby using the vein to physically separate the two structures (Patkowsk 2009).   Ligation  of  the  vein  provides  easy  access,  which  might  decrease the  risk  of  damaging  the  nerves  and  blood  vessels  during  the surgical repair (Morrow 2020). Consequently, the choice of surgical approach towards the azygos vein may influence both short-term and long-term complications and morbidity (Cui 2020).   In the last decade, randomized clinical trials have begun to study the  strengths  and  limitations  of  preservation  of  the  azygos  vein during  primary  surgical  repair  of  esophageal  atresia  (Cui  2020; Rashid 2012; Zimmer 2019).   We  have  not  identified  any  previous  systematic  review  that assesses  the  effects  of  preservation  of  the  azygos  vein  versus ligation  of  the  azygos  vein  during  primary  surgical  repair  of esophageal  atresia.  No  consensus  on  the  topic  was  achieved in  the  current  guidelines  from  the  European  Reference  Network for  rare  Inherited  and  Congenital  (digestive  and  gastrointestinal) Anomalies  (ERNICA)  (Dingemann  2020).  A  systematic  Cochrane Review  with  meta-analyses  of  randomized  clinical  trials  on  the topic  is  warranted;  it  may  aid  in  achieving  consensus  and potentially help to improve treatment in the future.   To assess the benefits and harms of preservation of the azygos vein versus ligation of the azygos vein during primary surgical repair of congenital esophageal atresia.   adverse event if the trial authors either 1) use the term 'serious adverse  event'  but  do  not  refer  to  ICH-GCP,  or  2)  report  the proportion  of  participants  with  an  event  we  consider  to  fulfil the ICH-GCP definition (e.g. anastomosis leakage or esophageal stricture). If a trial reports several of such events, we will choose the event with the highest proportion reported in each trial to avoid double-counting (Korang 2021a; Korang 2021b).   3. Proportion of participants with anastomosis leakage (as defined   by trialists).   Secondary outcomes   1. Proportion of participants with sepsis or mediastinitis. 2. Proportion of participants with esophageal stricture (as defined   by trialist).   3. Proportion  of  participants  with  recurrent  tracheoesophageal   fistula.   If the trials report multiple time points, we will use the time point at maximum follow-up as our primary time point of interest for all outcomes.   Search methods for identification of studies   Electronic searches   We  will  only  include  randomized  clinical  trials,  irrespective  of publication type, publications status, and language. We will include trials with parallel and cluster designs.   We  will  include  participants  less  than  three  months  of  age  with congenital  esophageal  atresia  undergoing  primary  repair/surgery (as defined by trialists).   The  intervention  group  will  have  preservation  of  the  azygos  vein in  children  whilst  undergoing  surgery  for  esophageal  atresia  (as defined by trialists).   The control group will receive ligation of the azygos vein in children whilst  undergoing  surgery  for  esophageal  atresia  (as  defined  by trialists).   1. All-cause mortality. 2. Proportion  of  participants  with  one  or  more  serious  adverse event. We will define a serious adverse event as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, jeopardized  the  participant,  was  persistent,  led  to  significant disability,  hospitalization,  or  prolonged  hospitalization  (ICH- GCP  2016).  We  expect  the  reporting  of  serious  adverse  events in  many  trials  to  be  heterogeneous  and  not  strictly  according to the recommendations regarding good clinical practice from The  International  Council  for  Harmonisation  of  Technical Requirements  for  Pharmaceuticals  for  Human  Use  (ICH-GCP) (ICH-GCP 2016). Therefore, we will include the event as a serious   We will search for studies using methods described in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews for Interventions (Lefebvre 2021).   We will search the following databases from the inception of each database  to  the  date  of  search  and  place  no  restrictions  on  the language of publication.   • Cochrane Gut Group Specialized Register • Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL)  (via Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews Database (EBMR), from inception; Appendix 1)   • MEDLINE (via Ovid, from 1946; Appendix 2) • Embase (via Ovid, from 1984; Appendix 3 • CINAHL  (Cumulative  Index  to  Nursing  and  Allied  Health   Literature) (EBSCO, from 1984; Appendix 4)   A  Cochrane  Gut  Information  Specialist  developed  the  search strategies. We will not apply an RCT filter in MEDLINE and Embase as the yield from preliminary testing showed fewer than 500 citations in each database (Lefebvre 2021).   To identify unpublished trials, we will search clinical trial registers: ClinicalTrials.gov  (www.ClinicalTrials.gov)  and  the  World  Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; apps.who.int/trialsearch/).   Searching other resources   We will check the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles  for  additional  references.  We  will  contact  experts  in  the field to identify additional unpublished materials. We will search for errata or retractions from included studies published in full text on PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), and report the date on which we searched this in the review.   all  randomized  participants  irrespective  of  the  interventions  that participants actually received.   Two review authors (SKK, SH) will independently screen titles and abstracts identified as a result of the search, and assess these for inclusion.   We will use the following domains to assess the trial methodology for  individually  randomized  trials  (Higgins  2021;  Sterne  2019  b; Appendix 5):   We  will  retrieve  selected  full-text  study  reports/publications,  and two  review  authors  (SKK,  SH)  will  independently  screen  the  full- text papers to identify trials for inclusion, and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreement  through  discussion  or,  if  required,  consult  a  third review author (ULT). We will exclude duplicates and collate multiple reports  of  the  same  study,  so  that  each  study  rather  than  each report  is  the  unit  of  interest  in  the  review.  We  will  record  the selection  process  in  sufficient  detail  to  complete  a  PRISMA  flow diagram  (Moher  2009),  and  'Characteristics  of  excluded  studies' table. We will not impose any language or publication restrictions.   We will use a data collection form to record study characteristics and  outcome  data,  which  we  will  pilot  on  at  least  one  study in  the  review.  One  review  author  (SKK  or  SH)  will  extract  trial characteristics  from  included  trials.  We  will  extract  the  following trial characteristics.   1. Methods:  trial  design,  total  duration  of  trial,  number  of  trial centers and location, trial setting, withdrawals, and date of trial. 2. Participants:  number  of  participants,  mean  age,  age  range, sex,  presence  of  other  anomalies,  diagnostic  criteria,  type of  esophageal  atresia  (Pinheiro  2012),  inclusion  criteria,  and exclusion criteria.   3. Interventions: intervention and comparison. 4. Outcomes:  primary  and  secondary  outcomes  specified  and   collected, and time points reported.   5. Notes: funding for trial, and notable conflicts of interest of trial   authors.   Two review authors (SKK, SH) will independently extract outcome data  from  included  trials.  We  will  note  in  the  'Characteristics  of included studies' table if a study does not report outcome data in a  usable  way.  We  will  resolve  disagreements  by  consensus  or  by consulting a third review author (ULT). One review author (SKK) will enter data into Review Manager software (Review Manager 2020). We will double-check that data are entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the study reports. A second review author (SH) will spot-check study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report.   • bias arising from the randomization process; • bias due to deviations from intended interventions; • bias due to missing outcome data; • bias in measurement of the outcome; and • bias in selection of the reported result.   For  trials  that  allocated  clusters  of  individuals,  we  will  include an additional domain specific to that trial design (Eldridge 2016), i.e. bias arising from the timing of identification or recruitment of individual participants within clusters.   We will use the most recently developed Rob 2 Excel toolto manage the RoB 2 assessments.   Overall risk of bias   The overall rating assigns one of three levels of judgement:   • low risk of bias: the trial is judged to be at low risk of bias for all   domains for this result;   • some concerns: the trial is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain for this result, but is not at high risk of bias for any of the remaining domains;   • high risk of bias: the trial is judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain for this result, or the study is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the result.   Judging  a  result  to  be  at  a  particular  level  of  risk  of  bias  for  an individual domain implies that the result has an overall risk of bias that is at least this severe.   We  will  assess  the  domains  ‘bias  due  to  missing  outcome  data', 'bias in measurement of the outcome', and ‘bias in selection of the reported result' for all of our outcomes.   We will store our RoB 2 evaluation data on local secure computers and provide the links to our evaluation data with the publication of the review. We plan to use the web app 'robvis' to generate a traffic- light plot of our RoB 2 assessments (Sterne 2019 a).   The risk of bias assessments will feed into one domain of the GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of a body of evidence.   Measures of treatment effect   We  will  undertake  risk  of  bias  (RoB)  assessments  according  to Chapter  8  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of Interventions (Higgins 2021; RoB 2 2019). Two review authors (SKK and  SH)  will  each  independently  assess  the  risk  of  bias  in  the included trials. In case of disagreements, a third author (JCJ) will arbitrate.   We  will  assess  the  effect  of  assignment  to  the  intervention, using  RoB  2  (Higgins  2021).  Therefore,  we  will  perform  analysis based  on  the  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  principle,  which  includes   We will enter the outcome data for each trial into the data tables in Review Manager 5.4.1 to calculate the treatment effects (Review Manager 2020).   We will calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 97.5% confidence intervals (CI)  for  dichotomous  outcomes.  We  do  not  have  any  continuous outcomes.   Unit of analysis issues   The  unit  of  analysis  will  be  the  children  participating  in  the individually-randomized trials.   We will analyze cluster-randomized trials according to the Cochrane Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2019). If  results  do  not  control  for  clustering,  we  will  contact  trialists  to request an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC). If we are unable to obtain an ICC from the trialists, we will calculate the ICC using design effects (Killip 2004).   Where a single trial reports multiple intervention groups, we will include only those relevant for our review intervention groups. If there are two experimental intervention groups of interest to our review and a common control intervention group in the same trial that are both relevant to the same meta-analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double-counting while adding data to the meta-analysis.   We  will  contact  investigators  or  study  sponsors  in  order  to  verify key  study  characteristics  and  obtain  missing  numerical  outcome data  where  possible  (e.g.  when  a  study  is  identified  as  abstract only).  Where  this  is  not  possible,  and  we  think  the  missing  data could introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results by conducting a sensitivity analysis.   We  will  use  intention-to-treat  data  if  the  original  report  contains such  data.  If  the  report  does  not  include  such  data,  we  will  not impute  missing  values  for  any  outcomes  in  our  primary  analysis, but we will assess the effects of missing data in our two sensitivity analyses (see Sensitivity analysis).   We  will  assess  our  intervention  effects  with  both  random-effects meta-analyses (DerSimonian 1986), and fixed-effect meta-analyses (DeMets 1987). We will use the more conservative point estimate of the two. The more conservative point estimate is the estimate closest  to  zero  effect  (Jakobsen  2014).  We  use  three  primary outcomes and, therefore, we will consider a P value of 0.025 or less as the threshold for statistical significance (Jakobsen 2014).   If  pooling  is  not  possible,  we  will  describe  the  results  of  the individual trials narratively.   Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity   We plan to conduct the following subgroup analyses.   1. Trials at low risk of bias compared to trials at high risk of bias.   • We  will  pool  trials  assessed  to  have  'some  concerns'  with   trials assessed to be at 'high risk'.   • This  subgroup  is  planned  because  high  risk  of  bias  trials and trials with 'some concerns' usually overestimate positive intervention  effects  and  underestimate  negative  effects (Gluud  2006;  Kjaergard  2001;  Savović  2012;  Savović  2018; Schulz 1995; Wood 2008).   2. Trials at high or uncertain risks of vested interests compared to   trials at low risk of vested interests. • This subgroup will assess for-profit bias (Lundh 2017).   3. Trials  including  newborns  with  isolated  esophageal  atresia including  newborns  with  additional   compared  to  trials congenital malformation.   4. Trials including participants with different types of esophageal   atresia (Pinheiro 2012).   We will visually inspect forest plots to assess signs of heterogeneity and  explore  possible  heterogeneity  in  our  prespecified  subgroup analyses.  We  will  also  inspect  study  characteristics  across  trials to  identify  clinical  heterogeneity.  We  will  assess  the  presence of  statistical  heterogeneity  using  the  Chi2  test  (threshold  P  < 0.10)  and  measure  the  quantities  of  heterogeneity  using  the  I2 statistic  (Higgins  2002;  Higgins  2003).  If  we  detect  moderate  or high  heterogeneity,  we  plan  to  explore  the  possible  causes  (for example, differences in study design, participants, interventions or completeness of outcome assessments). Ultimately, we may decide that a meta-analysis should be avoided (Deeks 2021).   We will use a funnel plot to assess publication bias if we include 10 or more trials. We will visually inspect funnel plots to assess the risk of bias, and test asymmetry with the Harbord test (Harbord 2006).   We  will  pool  data  from  studies  we  judge  to  be  clinically homogeneous  using  Review  Manager  software  or  STATA  (Review Manager 2020; STATA 2019). If more than one study provides usable data in any single comparison, we will perform a meta-analysis.   this  meta-analysis  according   We  will  undertake the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2021). We will use Review Manager 5.4.1 or STATA (Review Manager 2020; STATA 2019).   5. Trials including participants with different types of preoperative risk factors according to the Waterston classification (Pinheiro 2012).   If trials include a mix of the different types of esophageal atresia, we will contact the authors to request separate data for the relevant groups of participants for subgroup analyses three to five.   Sensitivity analysis   To assess the potential impact of missing data, we will perform two sensitivity analyses on the primary outcomes.   ‘Best-worst-case’ scenario: we will assume that all participants lost  to  follow-up  in  the  experimental  group  survived,  had  no serious adverse event, and had no anastomosis leakage. We will assume that all of those with missing outcomes in the control group died, had a serious adverse event, and had anastomosis leakage. 'Worst-best-case’ scenario: we will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the experimental group died, had a serious adverse  event,  and  had  anastomosis  leakage.  We  will  assume that all those participants lost to follow-up in the control group survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no anastomosis leakage.  We  will  present  the  results  of  both  scenarios  in  our review.   Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence   We  will  create  a  summary  of reporting our  primary  outcomes:  all-cause  mortality,  serious  adverse secondary events,  and  anastomosis   leakage;  and   findings   fistula.  We  will  use  the   outcomes  sepsis  or  mediastinitis,  esophageal  stricture,  and recurrent  tracheoesophageal five GRADE  considerations  (study  limitations,  consistency  of  effect, imprecision,  indirectness,  and  publication  bias)  to  assess  the certainty of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes (Atkins  2004).  We  will  use  methods  and  recommendations described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Schünemann 2021), using GRADEproGDT software (GRADEpro GDT). We will justify all decisions to downgrade or  upgrade  the  certainty  of  studies,  report  our  rationale  in footnotes, and make comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.

         "BACKGROUND\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ACVDs), a condition characterised by lipid accumulation in arterial walls, which is often exacerbated by chronic inflammation disorders, is the major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Colchicine, with its first medicinal use in ancient Egypt, is an inexpensive drug with anti-inflammatory properties. However, its role in primary prevention of ACVDs in the general population remains unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the clinical benefits and harms of colchicine as primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Heart Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, Web of Science, and LILACS. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP for ongoing and unpublished studies. We also scanned the reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no limitations on language, date of publication, or study setting. The search results were updated on 31 May 2023.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any setting, recruiting adults without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. We included trials that compared colchicine versus placebo, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and adverse events.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo or more review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and performed risk of bias and GRADE assessments.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified 15 RCTs (1721 participants randomised; 1412 participants analysed) with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 728 weeks. The intervention was oral colchicine compared with placebo, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care or no treatment. Due to biases and imprecision, the evidence was very uncertain for all outcomes. All trials but one had a high risk of bias. Five out of seven meta-analyses included fewer than six trials (71.4%). The objectives of the review were to assess cardiovascular outcomes in the general population, but many of the included trials focused on liver disease. Colchicine compared to placebo Colchicine may reduce all-cause mortality compared to placebo in primary prevention, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.91; 6 studies, 463 participants; very low-certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 11, 95% CI 6 to 67). Colchicine may result in little to no difference in non-fatal myocardial infarction, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.82; 1 study, 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Colchicine may not reduce the incidence of stroke, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.43, 95% CI 0.67 to 8.86; 1 study, 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding adverse events, colchicine may increase the incidence of diarrhoea (RR 3.99, 95% CI 1.44 to 11.06; 8 studies, 605 participants; very low-certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 10, 95% CI 6 to 17), and may have little to no effect on neurological outcomes such as seizure or mental confusion (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.66; 2 studies, 155 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The effect of colchicine on cardiovascular mortality is also very uncertain (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 62.43; 2 studies, 160 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Colchicine may not reduce post-cardiac procedure atrial fibrillation, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.19; 1 study, 100 participants). We found no trials reporting on pericardial effusion, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, or unstable angina. Colchicine compared to methotrexate (immunomodulating drug) Colchicine may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality compared to methotrexate, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.51; 1 study, 85 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found no trials reporting other cardiovascular outcomes or adverse events for this comparison. Colchicine compared to usual care or no treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of colchicine compared with usual care on all-cause mortality in primary prevention (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.27; 2 studies, 729 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding adverse events, colchicine may increase the incidence of diarrhoea compared to usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.56 to 7.03; 2 studies, 729 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NNTH 18, 95% CI 12 to 42). No trials reported other cardiovascular outcomes for this comparison.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis Cochrane review evaluated the clinical benefits and harms of using colchicine for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in the general population. Comparisons were made against placebo, immunomodulating medications, or usual care or no treatment. However, the certainty of the evidence for the predefined outcomes was very low, highlighting the pressing need for high-quality, rigorous studies to ascertain colchicine's clinical impact definitively. We identified numerous biases and inaccuracies in the included studies, limiting their generalisability and precluding a conclusive determination of colchicine's efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events. The existing evidence regarding colchicine's potential cardiovascular benefits or harms for primary prevention is inconclusive owing to the limitations inherent in the current studies. More robust clinical trials are needed to bridge this evidence gap effectively.",

The objectives are as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nTo assess the clinical benefit and harms of colchicine as primary prevention of\ncardiovascular outcomes in the general population.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) include coronary heart disease (CHD), sudden cardiac\ndeath/sudden cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, stroke/transient ischemic attack,\nrheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary\nembolism, and peripheral arterial disease.  From 1990 to 2019, the prevalence of cases\nof total CVDs has been nearly doubled from 271 million (95% uncertainty interval: 257 to\n285 million) to 523 million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million), respectively (Roth 2020). In\naddition, it has been estimated that CVDs caused 18.6 million (95% uncertainty interval:\n17.1 to 19.7 million) deaths in 2019 (Roth 2020). Doubtlessly,  CVDs yield a high socio-\neconomic burden in the general population (Flora 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe main cause of CVDs is atherosclerosis which is the result of cellular-molecular\ninteractions in the artery wall (Gotlieb  1991); therefore, it is a chronic inflammatory\ndisease with autoimmune foundations (Anyfanti 2021; Barrett 2020; Cochain\n2017; Eshghjoo 2021;  Fazeli 2021; Frostegård 2013; Geovanini 2018; Gisterå\n2017; Hansson 2006; Hussain 2020;  Kobiyama 2018; Libby 2019; Liu 2019;  Martinez\n2018; Mizuno 2011; Oikonomou 2020; Ozen 2021; Patel 2021; Pant 2014; Rahman\n2017; Shi 2010; Veronese 2018; Wolf 2019; Zhu 2018). Patients with autoimmune\ndisorders, rheumatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and osteoarthritis have a\nhigher frequency of cardiovascular events as compared to the healthy population (Croca\n2017;  Hannawi 2021; Li 2021; Liu 2018; Semb 2017; Vicente 2021; Yalcinkaya 2021).\nThe incidence of myocardial infarction in people with rheumatoid arthritis seems to be\ncomparable or higher than in people with diabetes mellitus (Ali 2021; Wang 2021).\nTherefore, rheumatoid arthritis should be considered as a prominent risk factor for CVDs\nevents (Ferraz-Amaro 2021), and a multidisciplinary team should be cardiologists ( (Ali\n2021).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nRecently, it has been pointed out a potential relationship between a pro-protein\nconvertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and an autoimmune disease (Ministrini 2021).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.0**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe interrelationship between immunity, inflammation, and atherosclerosis could explain\nthe cardiovascular construct termed residual inflammatory risk (RIR) (Ridker 2018). The\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.0**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nRIR is defined by the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) higher than 2\nmg/l (Ridker 2018), a well-known biomarker of cardiovascular disease (Liuzzo 1994). The\nRIR should not be confused with the residual cholesterol risk (low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol -LDL-C- higher to 100 mg/dl), residual triglyceride risk  (triglycerides higher to\n200 mg/dl and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol -HDL- lower to 40 mg/dl), residual\nlipoprotein a risk (Lp(a)) higher to 50 mg/dl), and residual thrombotic risk without a\npredefined biomarker (Ridker 2018). It has been suggested that, in primary prevention,\nthe evaluation of hs-CRP is a useful prognostic factor as much as other conventional\nmeasurements of cardiovascular risk, i.e.,  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (Ridker 2018). Subclinical inflammation can be better\nmonitored with hs-CRP (Ridker 2018). Therefore, a decrease in inflammatory burden\nshould decrease the risk of future cardiovascular disease (Whayne 2021).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSimilarly, the concept of residual cardiovascular risk (RCR) has been proposed (Vanuzzo\n2011). Hermans et al. 2010, defined it as the \"residual risk of incident vascular events or\nprogression of established vascular damage persisting in patients treated with current\nevidence-based recommended care. This risk includes established risk factors, such as\ndyslipidemia, high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, inflammation,  unhealthy lifestyles, and\nthe risk related to emerging or newer risk factors\" (Hermans 2010).  Both RIR and  RCR\nare unique. The link between inflammation and atherosclerosis has been supported by\nthe use of anti-inflammatory therapies, biological agents, or anti-inflammatory drugs used\nto treat non-atherosclerotic inflammatory diseases and hence reduce cardiovascular\nevents (Arbel 2018; Bäck 2015; Kottoor 2018; Moriya 2019; Roman 2020). Colchicine\nbelongs to the second group of medications (Chistiakov 2018; Dasgeb 2018; Imazio\n2016; Thompson 2019; Whayne 2021). Colchicine's prescription in cardiovascular\nmedicine is a new use for an ancient drug (Chen 2017; Tong 2016).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nColchicine has been used in  gout, familial Mediterranean fever disorders, osteoarthritis\n(Akman 2018; Alarcón 1981; Aran 2011; Cronstein 2013; Das 2002;  Halabe-Cherem\n2009; Kiraz 1998;  Lazaros 2018; Liantinioti 2018; Meneses 2015; Nuki 2008; Plotz 2021;\nRichette 2010; Vilardell 1978),  dermatological disorders (Kaur 2020; Fujii\n2021; Micheletti 2020; Zhao 2021), urological disorders (Sinanoglu 2018; Akman\n2011; Ibrahim 2019),  hepatology (Gong 2004; Rambaldi 2001), respiratory medicine\n(Gomer 2010), gastroenterology (Verne 2003; Rajapakse 2001; Verne 1997), and from\nsecondary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes (Fiolet 2020; Imazio 2005; Imazio\n2005a; Imazio 2011; Imazio 2014; Imazio 2014; Imazio 2014a; Maisch 2004; Nidorf\n2013; Nidorf 2014; Roubille 2020; Siak 2021; Tardif 2019; Xia 2021).  The effect of\ncolchicine is unique since it binds to unpolymerized tubulin heterodimers, forming a stable\ncomplex that effectively inhibits microtubule dynamics, not affecting the glucocorticoid\nsignaling pathway as well arachidonic acid metabolites production and signal transduction\n(Deftereos 2013 ). Reglero-Real 2021 et al have reported the importance of leukocyte\ntrafficking and organ damage and have shown that endothelial cell autophagy remodels\nendothelial cell architecture, restraining neutrophils diapedesis in inflamed tissue.  It\nfollows then that colchicine could protect against damage in peripheral organs by a\nsimilar mechanism.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nThe Cochrane review's scope will be the colchicine use for primary prevention of\ncardiovascular outcomes in the general population.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nColchicine is a tricyclic alkaloid extracted from Colchicum autumnale and Gloriosa\nsuperba (Finkelstein 2010; Imazio 2021; Karamanou 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.0**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis drug is administered in either solid or liquid oral dosage form (FDA 2021; FDA\n2021a). It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (Finkelstein 2010) and is\nmainly metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome P3A4 and P-glycoprotein metabolize\ncolchicine; thus, any drug that binds these proteins influences the colchicine's\npharmacokinetics (Borron 1996; Nuki 2008; Slobodnick  2015). The leukocytes are the\nmain targets of colchicine (Chappey 1993). The drug's half-life is between 41 and 46\nhours for leukocytes and 49 hours for plasma (Chappey 1993).  Colchicine binds to\nalbumin in ~40% (Sabouraud 1994), and it is excreted in unchanged form. As metabolites\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.0**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin the faeces (about 80%) and 10-20% are excreted in the urine, the levels increase with\nliver disease. In patients with kidney impairment, colchicine's clearance is also reduced\n(Liantinioti 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nColchicine has a narrow therapeutic index (Essame\n2020; Finkelstein 2010; Ghawanmeh 2020), and its toxicity is associated with a poor\nprognosis (Essame 2020; Finkelstein 2010). Several drugs inhibit colchicine metabolism;\neither cytochrome P450 or P-glycoprotein: macrolides (mainly clarithromycin),\nantiretroviral therapy,  broad-spectrum oral antifungal agent (ketoconazole, etc.),\ngrapefruit juice, histamine H2-antagonists (cimetidine), steroids (hydrocortisone,\ndexamethasone), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine), calcium-\nchannel blocker (verapamil, diltiazem), and immunosuppressors (cyclosporine A and\ntacrolimus are potent inhibitors). Colchicine's dosage must be reduced and closely\nmonitored in patients with relevant hepatic and/or renal dysfunction (Cocco 2010; Curiel\n2012; Hung 2005; Imai 2020). Thus, the patients receiving colchicine must be monitored\nclosely, especially in elderly patients with kidney failure (Anonymous 2008; Ho 2019).\nColchicine prescribers must know the drug interaction between colchicine and several\ndrugs to reduce the likelihood of fatal and non-fatal colchicine-related side effects\n(Amanova 2014; Borron 1996; Dahan 2009; Davis 2013; Imai 2020; Magro 2021; Rollot\n2004; Slobodnick  2015; Stewart 2020;  Villa Zapata 2020). Colchicine increases the rate\nof diarrhoea and gastrointestinal adverse events that precedes liver, sensory, muscle,\ninfectious, hematologic adverse events, or death (Stewart 2020).  Recently, Dubé et\nal. described two genomic regions associated with gastrointestinal events in patients\ntreated with colchicine. It may benefit some patients with genetic predispositions to lower\ntolerability of treatment with colchicine (Dubé 2021).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAs mentioned above, the colchicine effect, despite its narrow therapeutic window, is to\nprotect the damage of organs by impeding the recruitment of neutrophils and hence\ndecrease the inflammatory burden.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nColchicine binds to the following three proteins: tubulin, cytochrome P450, and P-\nglycoprotein (Slobodnick  2015). The first protein, tubulin, is the main one to explain the\ndrug's clinical benefits and harms. The other two are essential to explain that the\ncolchicine's pharmacokinetic properties as it was described.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nColchicine acts blocking the microtubules' functions (Wilson 1976). Microtubules are the\nmain component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton (Bershadsky 1988) which\npossess essential roles in cell division, shaping, motility, and intracellular transport\n(Forkosh 2020; Janke 2020; Morton 1999; Roll-Mecak 2020, Taylor 1965). The colchicine\ntarget is tubulin; a protein made up of two subunits called alpha and beta (Janke\n2020; Roll-Mecak 2020).  The union colchicine-tubulin yields a microtubule-\ndisassembling  (Chaldakov 2018) which explains the anti-inflammatory benefits of\ncolchicine (Forkosh 2020; Terkeltaub 2009).  The inhibitory action may explain the\nbenefits due to the colchicine effects over macrophages, platelets, endothelial cells, and\nleukocytes, especially neutrophils (Cerquaglia 2005; Cronstein 1995; Imazio 2016; Hu\n2021; Leung 2015; Paschke 2013; Perico 1996; Pircher 2019; Liang 2019; Rudolph\n1977).  Leung et al. have reported diverse molecular mechanisms induced by the\ninhibitory action of colchicine (Leung 2015). These cells play a central role in the\ninflammatory process by several pathways and, thus, in the previous steps of the\natheroma plaque (d'Alessandro 2020;  Ma 2019; Nording 2020; Schrottmaier 2020).\nTherefore, colchicine could prevent cardiovascular events in a primary prevention setting\n(Tsivgoulis 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.0**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis review is critical for the following reasons. First, according to a Cochrane review,\nthere is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of colchicine in the general population\n(Hemkens 2016). Of the 39 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in Hemkens\n2016, 82% (32/39) come from populations with chronic liver diseases, renal and primary\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.0**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\namyloidosis, gout, Behçet's syndrome, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore,\nseveral trials reported no cardiovascular risk profile. Therefore, this Cochrane review is\nrequired to assess the clinical benefits and risks of colchicine in the primary prevention of\ncardiovascular events, either in people with or without cardiovascular risk factors.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSecond, numerous non-Cochrane systematic reviews emphasize the prevention of atrial\nfibrillation (AF) after a post-cardiac procedure. Some included both levels of prevention\n(Lennerz 2017; Papageorgiou 2017; Salih 2017; Verma 2015; Trivedi 2014; Wang 2016).\nHowever, these meta-analyses show inconsistencies: in the measure of evaluation of the\neffect of the intervention, i.e., odds ratio or risk ratio; reported funnel-plots with less than\nten RCTs, lack of assessment of the risk of bias in the included trials or that used out-of-\ndate assessment scales, and without information about the certainty of the evidence.\nTherefore, it is mandatory to specify the role of colchicine in the primary prevention of\ncardiovascular events with Cochrane's methodology.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThird, it is necessary to conduct a critical appraisal of trials in the primary prevention of\npost-pericardiotomy syndrome (Finkelstein 2002; Imazio 2010) and early postoperative\npericardial and pleural effusions (Imazio 2011a; Meurin 2015). According to the\ninformation reported in the clinical practice guidelines of international scientific societies,\nthere is uncertainty about the role of colchicine in the primary prevention of AF post-\ncardiac surgery (Calkins 2017; January 2014; Kirchhof 2016). Fourth, there is uncertainty\nabout the role of colchicine in the scope of the primary prevention of cardiovascular\nevents in rheumatological diseases, which have inflammatory nature with a strong link\nwith atherogenesis. Therefore, critical appraisal of the RCTs will be necessary to\ndetermine the certainty of the evidence. All this will allow us to get firm conclusions to\nfacilitate better decision-making in clinical and epidemiological practice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nTo assess the clinical benefit and harms of colchicine as primary prevention of\ncardiovascular outcomes in the general population.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status. We\nwill only include RCTs with a parallel design and a minimum follow-up of  1 year. The 1-\nyear minimum follow-up is based on the premise that cardiovascular events require\nenough time to develop. The exception will be for studies including people with post-\ncardiac procedure atrial fibrillation, in which case there will not be a minimum follow-up\nrequirement.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe will exclude non-randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, we will not apply any\nlimitation by language, and country. We will include studies reported as full-text, those\npublished as abstract only, and unpublished data. Cross-over and cluster-randomized\ntrials are not suitable due to the nature of the clinical conditions where colchicine is\nprescribed and its intervention's pharmacodynamic properties, especially the very long\nelimination half-life of the colchicine.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe will analyze carefully whether trials were published in predatory journals\n(https://beallslist.net/).

Therefore, a\njudgment of ‘High’ risk of bias within any domain will have a similar implication for the\nresult as a whole, irrespective of which domain is being assessed. ‘Some concerns’ in\nmultiple domains may lead the review authors to decide on an overall judgment of ‘High’\nrisk of bias for that outcome or group of outcomes (Higgins 2019a).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nThe overall risk of bias for the result is the least favorable assessment across the\ndomains of bias:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n1.

For a proper interpretation of the I2, we will follow the\nrelevant Cochrane Handbook's recommendations: \"The importance of the observed value\nof I2 depends on (1) magnitude and direction of effects, and (2) strength of evidence for\nheterogeneity (e.g. P-value from the Chi2 test, or a confidence interval for I2: uncertainty\nin the value of I2 is substantial when the number of studies is small).\" (Deeks 2019).\nHowever, we will consider statistical heterogeneity to be present if I² is greater than 70%\n(Deeks 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.0**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIf there are 10 or more randomized clinical trials by the outcome, we will use the contour\nenhanced funnel plot to differentiate asymmetry that is due to publication bias from that\ndue to other factors (Sterne 2011). We will assess the likelihood of publication bias with\nHarbord's test (Sterne 2011). We will use Stata statistical software to produce\nconventional and contour funnel plots.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe will follow the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews\nof Interventions to summarize study characteristics and\nprepare for synthesis (McKenzie 2019). If data pooling is not feasible, we will show the\ninformation as a narrative summary of the evidence presented in\neither text or tabular form. However, if there is evidence that an effect exists in at least\none study,  we plan to use an albatross plot with combines P values (Harrison\n2017; McKenzie 2019). Albatross plot requires a two-sided P value, sample size, and\ndirection of effect (or equivalently, a one-sided P value and sample size) for each result\n(Harrison 2017; McKenzie 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe will perform meta-analyses with 95% CI using random-effects. In the case of\nstatistical heterogeneity (I² > 70%), we will report the prediction interval (Deeks\n2019; IntHout 2016; Riley 2011). If there were simultaneously statistical heterogeneity\nand three or more trials, we will determine the 95% prediction interval, which takes into\naccount the whole distribution of the effects (Riley 2011). Prediction intervals in meta-\nanalysis show the expected range of true effects in similar studies (Borenstein\n2017; IntHout 2016). The prediction interval will show the distribution of the true effect\nsizes, which does not mean precision of the mean of the effect sizes (Borenstein\n2009, Borenstein 2017). We will estimate the 95% prediction interval with Stata statistical\nsoftware (STATA) (Kontopantelis 2010).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nRegardless of the overall risk of bias, all RCTs will contribute to the primary analyses.

We hypothesize that the following\ncovariates could explain the potential statistical heterogeneity:  rheumatological disorders\n(rheumatoid arthritis or gout), cardiovascular risk factor, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein\nlevel, and rheumatoid arthritis (Deeks 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n1.

Colchicine for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events (Protocol). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews TBD, Issue TBD. Art. No.: CD015003. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD015003.   This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows:   To assess the clinical benefit and harms of colchicine as primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.   Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) include coronary heart disease (CHD), sudden cardiac death/sudden cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, stroke/transient ischemic attack, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and peripheral arterial disease.  From 1990 to 2019, the prevalence of cases of total CVDs has been nearly doubled from 271 million (95% uncertainty interval: 257 to 285 million) to 523 million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million), respectively (Roth 2020). In addition, it has been estimated that CVDs caused 18.6 million (95% uncertainty interval: 17.1 to 19.7 million) deaths in 2019 (Roth 2020). Doubtlessly,  CVDs yield a high socio- economic burden in the general population (Flora 2019).   The main cause of CVDs is atherosclerosis which is the result of cellular-molecular interactions in the artery wall (Gotlieb  1991); therefore, it is a chronic inflammatory disease with autoimmune foundations (Anyfanti 2021; Barrett 2020; Cochain 2017; Eshghjoo 2021;  Fazeli 2021; Frostegård 2013; Geovanini 2018; Gisterå 2017; Hansson 2006; Hussain 2020;  Kobiyama 2018; Libby 2019; Liu 2019;  Martinez 2018; Mizuno 2011; Oikonomou 2020; Ozen 2021; Patel 2021; Pant 2014; Rahman 2017; Shi 2010; Veronese 2018; Wolf 2019; Zhu 2018). Patients with autoimmune disorders, rheumatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and osteoarthritis have a higher frequency of cardiovascular events as compared to the healthy population (Croca 2017;  Hannawi 2021; Li 2021; Liu 2018; Semb 2017; Vicente 2021; Yalcinkaya 2021). The incidence of myocardial infarction in people with rheumatoid arthritis seems to be comparable or higher than in people with diabetes mellitus (Ali 2021; Wang 2021). Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis should be considered as a prominent risk factor for CVDs events (Ferraz-Amaro 2021), and a multidisciplinary team should be cardiologists ( (Ali 2021).   Recently, it has been pointed out a potential relationship between a pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and an autoimmune disease (Ministrini 2021).   The interrelationship between immunity, inflammation, and atherosclerosis could explain the cardiovascular construct termed residual inflammatory risk (RIR) (Ridker 2018). The   RIR is defined by the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) higher than 2 mg/l (Ridker 2018), a well-known biomarker of cardiovascular disease (Liuzzo 1994). The RIR should not be confused with the residual cholesterol risk (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol -LDL-C- higher to 100 mg/dl), residual triglyceride risk  (triglycerides higher to 200 mg/dl and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol -HDL- lower to 40 mg/dl), residual lipoprotein a risk (Lp(a)) higher to 50 mg/dl), and residual thrombotic risk without a predefined biomarker (Ridker 2018). It has been suggested that, in primary prevention, the evaluation of hs-CRP is a useful prognostic factor as much as other conventional measurements of cardiovascular risk, i.e.,  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (Ridker 2018). Subclinical inflammation can be better monitored with hs-CRP (Ridker 2018). Therefore, a decrease in inflammatory burden should decrease the risk of future cardiovascular disease (Whayne 2021).   Similarly, the concept of residual cardiovascular risk (RCR) has been proposed (Vanuzzo 2011). Hermans et al. 2010, defined it as the \"residual risk of incident vascular events or progression of established vascular damage persisting in patients treated with current evidence-based recommended care. This risk includes established risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, inflammation,  unhealthy lifestyles, and the risk related to emerging or newer risk factors\" (Hermans 2010).  Both RIR and  RCR are unique. The link between inflammation and atherosclerosis has been supported by the use of anti-inflammatory therapies, biological agents, or anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat non-atherosclerotic inflammatory diseases and hence reduce cardiovascular events (Arbel 2018; Bäck 2015; Kottoor 2018; Moriya 2019; Roman 2020). Colchicine belongs to the second group of medications (Chistiakov 2018; Dasgeb 2018; Imazio 2016; Thompson 2019; Whayne 2021). Colchicine's prescription in cardiovascular medicine is a new use for an ancient drug (Chen 2017; Tong 2016).   Colchicine has been used in  gout, familial Mediterranean fever disorders, osteoarthritis (Akman 2018; Alarcón 1981; Aran 2011; Cronstein 2013; Das 2002;  Halabe-Cherem 2009; Kiraz 1998;  Lazaros 2018; Liantinioti 2018; Meneses 2015; Nuki 2008; Plotz 2021; Richette 2010; Vilardell 1978),  dermatological disorders (Kaur 2020; Fujii 2021; Micheletti 2020; Zhao 2021), urological disorders (Sinanoglu 2018; Akman 2011; Ibrahim 2019),  hepatology (Gong 2004; Rambaldi 2001), respiratory medicine (Gomer 2010), gastroenterology (Verne 2003; Rajapakse 2001; Verne 1997), and from secondary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes (Fiolet 2020; Imazio 2005; Imazio 2005a; Imazio 2011; Imazio 2014; Imazio 2014; Imazio 2014a; Maisch 2004; Nidorf 2013; Nidorf 2014; Roubille 2020; Siak 2021; Tardif 2019; Xia 2021).  The effect of colchicine is unique since it binds to unpolymerized tubulin heterodimers, forming a stable complex that effectively inhibits microtubule dynamics, not affecting the glucocorticoid signaling pathway as well arachidonic acid metabolites production and signal transduction (Deftereos 2013 ). Reglero-Real 2021 et al have reported the importance of leukocyte trafficking and organ damage and have shown that endothelial cell autophagy remodels endothelial cell architecture, restraining neutrophils diapedesis in inflamed tissue.  It follows then that colchicine could protect against damage in peripheral organs by a similar mechanism.   The Cochrane review's scope will be the colchicine use for primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.   Colchicine is a tricyclic alkaloid extracted from Colchicum autumnale and Gloriosa superba (Finkelstein 2010; Imazio 2021; Karamanou 2018).   This drug is administered in either solid or liquid oral dosage form (FDA 2021; FDA 2021a). It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (Finkelstein 2010) and is mainly metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome P3A4 and P-glycoprotein metabolize colchicine; thus, any drug that binds these proteins influences the colchicine's pharmacokinetics (Borron 1996; Nuki 2008; Slobodnick  2015). The leukocytes are the main targets of colchicine (Chappey 1993). The drug's half-life is between 41 and 46 hours for leukocytes and 49 hours for plasma (Chappey 1993).  Colchicine binds to albumin in ~40% (Sabouraud 1994), and it is excreted in unchanged form. As metabolites   in the faeces (about 80%) and 10-20% are excreted in the urine, the levels increase with liver disease. In patients with kidney impairment, colchicine's clearance is also reduced (Liantinioti 2018).   Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index (Essame 2020; Finkelstein 2010; Ghawanmeh 2020), and its toxicity is associated with a poor prognosis (Essame 2020; Finkelstein 2010). Several drugs inhibit colchicine metabolism; either cytochrome P450 or P-glycoprotein: macrolides (mainly clarithromycin), antiretroviral therapy,  broad-spectrum oral antifungal agent (ketoconazole, etc.), grapefruit juice, histamine H2-antagonists (cimetidine), steroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine), calcium- channel blocker (verapamil, diltiazem), and immunosuppressors (cyclosporine A and tacrolimus are potent inhibitors). Colchicine's dosage must be reduced and closely monitored in patients with relevant hepatic and/or renal dysfunction (Cocco 2010; Curiel 2012; Hung 2005; Imai 2020). Thus, the patients receiving colchicine must be monitored closely, especially in elderly patients with kidney failure (Anonymous 2008; Ho 2019). Colchicine prescribers must know the drug interaction between colchicine and several drugs to reduce the likelihood of fatal and non-fatal colchicine-related side effects (Amanova 2014; Borron 1996; Dahan 2009; Davis 2013; Imai 2020; Magro 2021; Rollot 2004; Slobodnick  2015; Stewart 2020;  Villa Zapata 2020). Colchicine increases the rate of diarrhoea and gastrointestinal adverse events that precedes liver, sensory, muscle, infectious, hematologic adverse events, or death (Stewart 2020).  Recently, Dubé et al. described two genomic regions associated with gastrointestinal events in patients treated with colchicine. It may benefit some patients with genetic predispositions to lower tolerability of treatment with colchicine (Dubé 2021).   As mentioned above, the colchicine effect, despite its narrow therapeutic window, is to protect the damage of organs by impeding the recruitment of neutrophils and hence decrease the inflammatory burden.   Colchicine binds to the following three proteins: tubulin, cytochrome P450, and P- glycoprotein (Slobodnick  2015). The first protein, tubulin, is the main one to explain the drug's clinical benefits and harms. The other two are essential to explain that the colchicine's pharmacokinetic properties as it was described.   Colchicine acts blocking the microtubules' functions (Wilson 1976). Microtubules are the main component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton (Bershadsky 1988) which possess essential roles in cell division, shaping, motility, and intracellular transport (Forkosh 2020; Janke 2020; Morton 1999; Roll-Mecak 2020, Taylor 1965). The colchicine target is tubulin; a protein made up of two subunits called alpha and beta (Janke 2020; Roll-Mecak 2020).  The union colchicine-tubulin yields a microtubule- disassembling  (Chaldakov 2018) which explains the anti-inflammatory benefits of colchicine (Forkosh 2020; Terkeltaub 2009).  The inhibitory action may explain the benefits due to the colchicine effects over macrophages, platelets, endothelial cells, and leukocytes, especially neutrophils (Cerquaglia 2005; Cronstein 1995; Imazio 2016; Hu 2021; Leung 2015; Paschke 2013; Perico 1996; Pircher 2019; Liang 2019; Rudolph 1977).  Leung et al. have reported diverse molecular mechanisms induced by the inhibitory action of colchicine (Leung 2015). These cells play a central role in the inflammatory process by several pathways and, thus, in the previous steps of the atheroma plaque (d'Alessandro 2020;  Ma 2019; Nording 2020; Schrottmaier 2020). Therefore, colchicine could prevent cardiovascular events in a primary prevention setting (Tsivgoulis 2018).   This review is critical for the following reasons. First, according to a Cochrane review, there is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of colchicine in the general population (Hemkens 2016). Of the 39 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in Hemkens 2016, 82% (32/39) come from populations with chronic liver diseases, renal and primary   amyloidosis, gout, Behçet's syndrome, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, several trials reported no cardiovascular risk profile. Therefore, this Cochrane review is required to assess the clinical benefits and risks of colchicine in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, either in people with or without cardiovascular risk factors.   Second, numerous non-Cochrane systematic reviews emphasize the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) after a post-cardiac procedure. Some included both levels of prevention (Lennerz 2017; Papageorgiou 2017; Salih 2017; Verma 2015; Trivedi 2014; Wang 2016). However, these meta-analyses show inconsistencies: in the measure of evaluation of the effect of the intervention, i.e., odds ratio or risk ratio; reported funnel-plots with less than ten RCTs, lack of assessment of the risk of bias in the included trials or that used out-of- date assessment scales, and without information about the certainty of the evidence. Therefore, it is mandatory to specify the role of colchicine in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events with Cochrane's methodology.   Third, it is necessary to conduct a critical appraisal of trials in the primary prevention of post-pericardiotomy syndrome (Finkelstein 2002; Imazio 2010) and early postoperative pericardial and pleural effusions (Imazio 2011a; Meurin 2015). According to the information reported in the clinical practice guidelines of international scientific societies, there is uncertainty about the role of colchicine in the primary prevention of AF post- cardiac surgery (Calkins 2017; January 2014; Kirchhof 2016). Fourth, there is uncertainty about the role of colchicine in the scope of the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in rheumatological diseases, which have inflammatory nature with a strong link with atherogenesis. Therefore, critical appraisal of the RCTs will be necessary to determine the certainty of the evidence. All this will allow us to get firm conclusions to facilitate better decision-making in clinical and epidemiological practice.   To assess the clinical benefit and harms of colchicine as primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.   We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status. We will only include RCTs with a parallel design and a minimum follow-up of  1 year. The 1- year minimum follow-up is based on the premise that cardiovascular events require enough time to develop. The exception will be for studies including people with post- cardiac procedure atrial fibrillation, in which case there will not be a minimum follow-up requirement.   We will exclude non-randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, we will not apply any limitation by language, and country. We will include studies reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. Cross-over and cluster-randomized trials are not suitable due to the nature of the clinical conditions where colchicine is prescribed and its intervention's pharmacodynamic properties, especially the very long elimination half-life of the colchicine.   We will analyze carefully whether trials were published in predatory journals (https://beallslist.net/). A predatory journal is an exploitive for-profit publication model that promises a quick and easy publishing process with supposedly high editorial and publishing standards; however, it lacks quality control, transparency, and impact factor, threatening the foundation of evidence-based research (Van Nuland 2017).   We will not exclude any trial published in a predatory journal; however, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis.   We will only include adults (aged 18 years or more), regardless of gender, without a known history of cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, stroke, pericardial effusion, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral arterial disease). We will include participants with any risk factor of cardiovascular outcomes (i.e., blood hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney diseases).   We will also include pregnant women. However, we will no report pregnancy or childbirth outcomes. It means that we will only report cardiovascular outcomes and harms if available.   If we identify an RCT including participants with or without a history of cardiovascular outcomes, we plan to check whether there was information by subgroup. If there is no report, the trial will be excluded. However, before making a final decision, we will contact the lead author.   We will only include the intervention as monotherapy, given at any dosage. We will not pool all eligible comparators, but each will be a different comparison. For the purposes of the review, and in the absence of a standard definition of usual care, we will accept the following: \"it can include the routine care received by patients for prevention or treatment of diseases\" (Gellman 2013).   Colchicine is only administered by the oral route. We will only consider colchicine given alone (monotherapy), regardless of colchicine dosage.   Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:  indomethacin, celecoxib, mefenamic acid, naproxen, etoricoxib, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and high-dose aspirin.   Corticosteroids: dexamethasone, prednisone, deflazacort, prednisolone, and any other drug if it meets the criteria of this class of drugs.   Immunomodulating drugs: cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, D-penicillamine, and any other drug if it meets the criteria of this class of drugs.   Usual care.   Colchicine versus placebo   Colchicine versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs   Colchicine versus corticosteroids   Colchicine versus immunomodulating drugs   Colchicine versus usual care   We will accept co-interventions, including treatment of complications if they were administered equally to all intervention arms.   Reporting one or more of the outcomes listed here in the trial is not an inclusion criterion for the review. We will try to access the trial protocol or contact the trial authors to ascertain all measured outcomes, even if not reported. Relevant trials that measured these outcomes but did not report their results, or these are not reported in a usable format, will be included in the narrative. We will not exclude an RCT solely based on the reporting of the outcome data.   For all outcomes that could happen more than once in a trial participant, we will report the number of people with at least one event.   1. All-cause mortality   2. Non-fatal myocardial infarction   3. Stroke. We will include either acute ischemic stroke or acute cerebral hemorrhage.   However, the clinical diagnosis with imaging will be an eligibility criterion.   4. Adverse events: we will prioritize on:   a.  Gastrointestinal (diarrhea)   b. Liver (jaundice)   c. Kidney (acute renal failure)   d. Neurological (seizure, confusion)   e. Multiorgan failure   1. Cardiovascular mortality   2. Post-cardiac procedure atrial fibrillation   3. Pericardial effusion   4. Symptoms or intervention related to peripheral artery disease   5. Heart failure   6. Unstable angina   We will exclude economic costs as an outcome of this Cochrane Review. However, we will state that economic costs will be discussed in the discussion section in a narrative form if data are available.   We will identify relevant trials through systematic searches of the following bibliographic databases:   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library   MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 onwards)   Embase (Ovid, from 1980 onwards)   LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) (Bireme, from 1982 onwards).   The preliminary search strategy for MEDLINE (Ovid) will be adapted for use in the other databases (Appendix 1). The Cochrane sensitivity and precision-maximizing RCT filter (Lefebvre 2019) will be applied to MEDLINE (Ovid) and adaptations of it to the other databases, except CENTRAL.   We will search all databases from their inception to the present, and we will impose no restriction on the language of publication or publication status.   We will not perform a separate search for adverse events of colchicine used for the treatment of any disease. We will consider the adverse events described in included studies only.   We will also search in Web of Science CPCI-S (Conference Proceedings citation index- science to include conference abstracts.   We will also conduct a search of ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/) for ongoing or unpublished trials.   European Medicines Agency (EMA) (www.ema.europa.eu/en)   Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) (www.fda.gov/Drugs)   Three review authors (AMC, EAB, RR) will check reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.   We will also examine any relevant retraction statements and errata for included studies. We will exclude the retraction RCTs.   We will follow the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).   Two review authors [AMC, ACP] will independently screen titles and abstracts for the inclusion of all the potential studies. We will identify as a result of the search and code them as 'retrieve' (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or 'do not retrieve'. If there are any disagreements, a third author will be asked to arbitrate (RH). We will retrieve the full- text study reports/publication and three review authors [DM, CMA, RR] will independently screen the full-text and identify studies for inclusion, and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult to third-person [JBS]. We will identify and exclude duplicates and collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study rather than each report is the unit of interest in the review. We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table (Liberati 2009).   We will use a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data which has been piloted on at least one study in the review. Three review authors (AMC, RR, DM) will extract study characteristics from included studies. AC and CMA will check all this information. We will extract the following study characteristics.   1. Methods: study design, the total duration of the study, follow‐up period, details of   any 'run in' period, number of study centers and location, and study setting.   2. Participants: N randomized, N lost to follow-up/withdrawn, N analyzed, age (as   reported by trialist), sex, body mass index (BMI) (it is relevant to determine obesity diagnosis), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, relevant details for co- morbidities, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria.   3. Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant medications, and excluded medications. Appendix 2 shows details of the intervention description (Hoffmann 2014; Hoffmann 2017). We will collect adverse events information according to Li 2019. Appendix 3 shows details to recollect adverse events information with an Excel spreadsheet (Li 2019).   4. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected, and time   points reported.   5. Notes: number registration trial, trial conduction dates, a priori sample estimation,   financial disclosures, other disclosures, and funding/support. Published in a predatory journal.   Two review authors (AMC, RR) will independently extract outcome data from included studies. We will resolve disagreements by consensus or by involving two authors (RH, EA). One review author (AMC) will transfer data into the Review Manager (RevMan Web 2019). One review author (RR) will do the double-check that data is entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the data extraction form. A second review author (DM) will spot-check study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report.   Three review authors (AMC, DM, and RR) will independently assess the risk of bias for each study using version two of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (RoB 2), outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Boutron 2019; Higgins 2019a). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by involving another author (CMA). We will assess the risk of bias for the outcomes of the included trials that will be included in our Summary of Findings table (Schünemann 2019).   We will perform analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle which includes all randomized participants, irrespective of the interventions that participants actually received. We will use the following domains to assess the risk of bias in the individually randomized trials:   bias arising from the randomization process;   bias due to deviations from intended interventions;   bias due to missing outcome data;   bias in the measurement of the outcome;   and bias in the selection of the reported result (Higgins 2019a; Higgins 2019b).   We will use the signaling questions in the RoB 2 tool and rate each domain as 'low risk of bias', 'some concerns', or 'high risk of bias'.  The following response options will answers the signaling questions for these domains:   Probably yes   Probably no   No information   We will use algorithms to map our answers to the signaling questions per outcome and will propose a 'Risk of bias' for each domain (Higgins 2019b).   When we judge a result to be at a particular level of risk of bias for an individual domain, it implies that the overall result has a risk of bias that is at least this severe. Therefore, a judgment of ‘High’ risk of bias within any domain will have a similar implication for the result as a whole, irrespective of which domain is being assessed. ‘Some concerns’ in multiple domains may lead the review authors to decide on an overall judgment of ‘High’ risk of bias for that outcome or group of outcomes (Higgins 2019a).   The overall risk of bias for the result is the least favorable assessment across the domains of bias:   1. Low risk of bias will denote that the study will be judged to be at low risk of bias for   all domains for this result.   2. Some concerns will denote that the study will be judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain for this result, but not to be at high risk of bias for any domain.   3. High risk of bias will denote that study will be judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain for this result or the study is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the result (Higgins 2019a; Higgins 2019b).   We will store the data in an Excel tool to implement RoB 2 to show it to the audience (Higgins 2019b).   Due to all outcomes of this Cochrane review being dichotomous data, we will analyses them with the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).   The unit of analysis in this Cochrane Review will be the participant. The time of the analysis will be the longest established in each trial. In the case of multiple-armed trials, we plan to combine the groups to yield a single pairwise comparison (Higgins 2019c ).   We will assess the percentage of dropouts for each included trial, and for each intervention group, and will evaluate whether an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis had been performed or could have been performed from the available published information. We will try to contact the study authors to resolve any questions arising from this issue.   In order to undertake an ITT analysis, we will seek data from the trial authors about the number of participants in treatment groups, irrespective of their compliance and whether or not they were later thought to be ineligible, otherwise excluded from treatment, or lost to follow-up.   We will include participants with incomplete or missing data in sensitivity analyses by imputing them according to the following scenarios:   Extreme-case analysis favoring the experimental intervention ('best-worse' case scenario): none of the drop-outs/participants lost from the experimental arm, but all of the drop-outs/participants lost from the control arm experienced the outcome, including all randomized participants in the denominator (Hollis 1999).   Extreme-case analysis favoring the control ('worst-best' case scenario): all drop- outs/participants lost from the experimental arm, but none from the control arm experienced the outcome, including all randomized participants in the denominator (Hollis 1999).   We will use Stata software to assess the impact of the missing data.   The presence of heterogeneity will initially be detected from the visual assessment of the forest plots.   We will quantify statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic, which describes the percentage of total variation across trials that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (Higgins 2003). We will assume a range of 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity (Deeks 2019). For a proper interpretation of the I2, we will follow the relevant Cochrane Handbook's recommendations: \"The importance of the observed value of I2 depends on (1) magnitude and direction of effects, and (2) strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P-value from the Chi2 test, or a confidence interval for I2: uncertainty in the value of I2 is substantial when the number of studies is small).\" (Deeks 2019). However, we will consider statistical heterogeneity to be present if I² is greater than 70% (Deeks 2019).   If there are 10 or more randomized clinical trials by the outcome, we will use the contour enhanced funnel plot to differentiate asymmetry that is due to publication bias from that due to other factors (Sterne 2011). We will assess the likelihood of publication bias with Harbord's test (Sterne 2011). We will use Stata statistical software to produce conventional and contour funnel plots.   We will follow the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to summarize study characteristics and prepare for synthesis (McKenzie 2019). If data pooling is not feasible, we will show the information as a narrative summary of the evidence presented in either text or tabular form. However, if there is evidence that an effect exists in at least one study,  we plan to use an albatross plot with combines P values (Harrison 2017; McKenzie 2019). Albatross plot requires a two-sided P value, sample size, and direction of effect (or equivalently, a one-sided P value and sample size) for each result (Harrison 2017; McKenzie 2019).   We will perform meta-analyses with 95% CI using random-effects. In the case of statistical heterogeneity (I² > 70%), we will report the prediction interval (Deeks 2019; IntHout 2016; Riley 2011). If there were simultaneously statistical heterogeneity and three or more trials, we will determine the 95% prediction interval, which takes into account the whole distribution of the effects (Riley 2011). Prediction intervals in meta- analysis show the expected range of true effects in similar studies (Borenstein 2017; IntHout 2016). The prediction interval will show the distribution of the true effect sizes, which does not mean precision of the mean of the effect sizes (Borenstein 2009, Borenstein 2017). We will estimate the 95% prediction interval with Stata statistical software (STATA) (Kontopantelis 2010).   Regardless of the overall risk of bias, all RCTs will contribute to the primary analyses. We will conduct the meta-analyses with Review Manager Web (RevMan Web 2019).   If there are ten or more RCTs by the outcome and I² is greater than 70%, we will conduct a meta-regression with Stata statistical software.  We hypothesize that the following covariates could explain the potential statistical heterogeneity:  rheumatological disorders (rheumatoid arthritis or gout), cardiovascular risk factor, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, and rheumatoid arthritis (Deeks 2019).   1. Participants with rheumatological disorders (rheumatoid arthritis or gout) compared to participants without rheumatological disorders. (Hypothesis: rheumatological disorders people could suppose a higher risk).   2. Participants with cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, blood hypertension,   chronic kidney disease) compared to participants without cardiovascular risk factors. (Hypothesis: Participants with cardiovascular risk factors have a higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes).   3. Participants with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels higher than 2 mg/l versus participants with high-sensitivity C-reactive levels protein ≤ 2 mg/l. (Hypothesis: Higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein could suppose a higher risk).   We will conduct the subgroup analysis for all outcomes. We will use the formal test for subgroup differences in Review Manager (RevMan Web 2019) and base our interpretation on this.   1. Trials with a low risk of bias compared to trials with some concerns or a high risk of   3. Trials without support from a drug company compared to trials with support from the   drug company. Trials with support tend to report positive effects.   4. Trials non-published in predatory journals compared to trials published in predatory   journals. Trials published in predatory journals tend to report positive effects.   We plan only to conduct these analyses for the primary outcomes.   We will use the overall risk of bias for a study result, rather than specific domains. We will judge whether or not there is a difference between the primary analysis and sensitivity analysis by comparing changes in P values.   Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence   We will create Summary of the findings table using the predefined outcomes in this Cochrane review (all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, adverse events, cardiovascular mortality, post-cardiac procedure atrial fibrillation, and symptoms or intervention related to peripheral artery disease). We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of evidence as it relates to the RCTs which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the predefined outcomes (Atkins 2004; Guyatt 2008). We will use methods and recommendations described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Schünemann 2019) using GRADEpro software (GRADEpro GDT 2020). As listed in Types of interventions, each comparison will get a separate Summary of findings table. We will justify all decisions to downgrade the quality of RCTs using footnotes and we will make comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.   Judgment about the certainty of evidence will be made by two review authors (AMC, RR) working independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion or involving a third author (DM). Judgments will be justified, documented, and incorporated into reporting of results for each outcome.   We will use the GRADE Working Group's statements to communicate findings combining size and certainty of an effect acceptable ( Santesso 2020).   We express our acknowledgments to Nicole Martin, Fiona Stewart, Charlene Bridges from the Cochrane Heart editorial team; peer reviewers Arden Barry, Jean-Claude Tardif, Georgios Tsivgoulis, and an additional peer reviewer who wishes to remain anonymous; and the consumer reviewer Daniel J García Matínez.

We present an update of our Cochrane review\nfrom 2009.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTo investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than sham\n(placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic\nmigraine.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: 2016, issue 1); MEDLINE (via Ovid, 2008 to January 2016); Ovid\nEMBASE (2008 to January 2016); and Ovid AMED (1985 to January 2016). We checked PubMed for recent publications to April 2016. We\nsearched the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform to February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe included randomized trials at least eight weeks in duration that compared an acupuncture intervention with a no-acupuncture control\n(no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham-acupuncture intervention, or prophylactic drug in participants with episodic\nmigraine.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTwo reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results, and assessed risk of bias and\nquality of the acupuncture intervention. The primary outcome was migraine frequency (preferably migraine days, attacks or headache days\nif migraine days not measured/reported) after treatment and at follow-up. The secondary outcome was response (at least 50% frequency\nreduction). Safety outcomes were number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and number of participants reporting at\nleast one adverse effect. We calculated pooled effect size estimates using a fixed-effect model. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and\ncreated 'Summary of findings' tables.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAcupuncture for the prevention of episodic migraine (Review)\nCopyright © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We excluded five\npreviously included trials from this update because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months, and included\nfive new trials. Five trials had a no-acupuncture control group (either treatment of attacks only or non-regulated routine care), 15 a sham-\nacupuncture  control  group,  and  five  a  comparator  group  receiving  prophylactic  drug  treatment.  In  comparisons  with  no-acupuncture\ncontrol groups and groups receiving prophylactic drug treatment, there was risk of performance and detection bias as blinding was not\npossible. Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAcupuncture was associated with a moderate reduction of headache frequency over no acupuncture after treatment (four trials, 2199\nparticipants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.56; 95% CI -0.65 to -0.48); findings were statistically heterogeneous (I2 = 57%; moderate\nquality evidence). After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 41% of participants receiving acupuncture and 17% receiving no\nacupuncture (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.40; 95% CI 2.08 to 2.76; 4 studies, 2519 participants) with a corresponding number needed to treat for\nan additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); there was no indication of statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 7%; moderate quality\nevidence). The only trial with post-treatment follow-up found a small but significant benefit 12 months after randomisation (RR 2.16; 95%\nCI 1.35 to 3.45; NNT 7; 95% 4 to 25; 377 participants, low quality evidence).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBoth after treatment (12 trials, 1646 participants) and at follow-up (10 trials, 1534 participants), acupuncture was associated with a small\nbut statistically significant frequency reduction over sham (moderate quality evidence). The SMD was -0.18 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.08; I2 =\n47%) after treatment and -0.19 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.09; I2 = 59%) at follow-up. After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 50%\nof participants receiving true acupuncture and 41% receiving sham acupuncture (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.36; I2 = 48%; 14 trials,\n1825 participants) and at follow-up in 53% and 42%, respectively (pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; I2 = 61%; 11 trials, 1683 participants;\nmoderate  quality  evidence).  The  corresponding  NNTBs  are  11  (95%  CI  7.00  to  20.00)  and  10  (95%  CI  6.00  to  18.00),  respectively.  The\nnumber of participants dropping out due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 2.84; 95% CI 0.43 to 18.71; 7 trials, 931 participants; low quality\nevidence) and the number of participants reporting adverse effects (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; 4 trials, 1414 participants; moderate\nquality evidence) did not differ significantly between acupuncture and sham groups.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAcupuncture reduced migraine frequency significantly more than drug prophylaxis after treatment ( SMD -0.25; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.10; 3\ntrials, 739 participants), but the significance was not maintained at follow-up (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01; 3 trials, 744 participants;\nmoderate quality evidence). After three months headache frequency at least halved in 57% of participants receiving acupuncture and 46%\nreceiving prophylactic drugs (pooled RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44) and after six months in 59% and 54%, respectively (pooled RR 1.11; 95% CI\n0.97 to 1.26; moderate quality evidence). Findings were consistent among trials with I2 being 0% in all analyses. Trial participants receiving\nacupuncture were less likely to drop out due to adverse effects (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.86; 4 trials, 451 participants) and to report adverse\neffects (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62; 5 trials 931 participants) than participants receiving prophylactic drugs (moderate quality evidence).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe  available  evidence  suggests  that  adding  acupuncture  to  symptomatic  treatment  of  attacks  reduces  the  frequency  of  headaches.\nContrary  to  the  previous  findings,  the  updated  evidence  also  suggests  that  there  is  an  effect  over  sham,  but  this  effect  is  small.  The\navailable trials also suggest that acupuncture may be at least similarly effective as treatment with prophylactic drugs. Acupuncture can be\nconsidered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment. As for other migraine treatments, long-term studies, more\nthan one year in duration, are lacking.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nP L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for\npeople with migraine.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIndividuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a\ntherapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to\ntreat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of\npeople in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAcupuncture for the prevention of episodic migraine (Review)\nCopyright © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We omitted five trials from the original review\nbecause they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain-killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people\nhaving the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the\nskin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake'\nacupuncture.  The  results  were  dominated  by  three  good  quality  large  trials  (with  about  1200  people)  showing  that  the  effect  of  true\nacupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or\nthe numbers dropping out because of side effects.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful\ninformation. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people\ntaking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people\ntaking the drug.

Typical  characteristics  of\nthe headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate\nor  severe  intensity,  aggravation  by  routine  physical  activity  and\nassociation  with  nausea,  photophobia  or  phonophobia,  or  any\ncombination of all three (IHS 2013). Epidemiological studies have\nconsistently  shown  that  migraine  is  a  common  disorder  with\na  one-year  prevalence  of  around  10%  to  12%  and  a  lifetime\nprevalence  of  between  15%  and  20%  (Oleson  2007).  In  Europe,\nthe  economic  cost  of  migraine  is  estimated  at  EUR  27  billion  per\nyear (Andlin-Sobocki 2005). Migraine is subclassified into the more\nfrequent  episodic  migraine  (fewer  than  15  days  with  migrainous\nheadaches  per  month)  and  the  less  frequent  chronic  migraine\n(more  than  15  days  per  month).  Most  people  with  migraine  can\nbe  adequately  managed  by  treatingof  acute  headaches  alone,\nbut  a  relevant  minority  need  prophylactic  interventions,  as  their\nattacks  are  either  very  frequent  or  are  insufficiently  controlled\nby acute therapy. Several drugs, such as propranolol, metoprolol,\nflunarizine,  valproic  acid  and  topiramate,  have  been  shown  to\nreduce  attack  frequency  in  some  people  (Dodick  2007;  Linde  M\n2013a;  Linde  M  2013b),  however,  all  these  drugs  are  associated\nwith adverse effects. Dropout rates in most clinical trials are high,\nsuggesting that the drugs are not well accepted by patients. There\nis some evidence that behavioural interventions such as relaxation\nor biofeedback are beneficial (Holroyd 1990; Nestoriuc 2007), but\nadditional effective, low-risk treatments are clearly desirable.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAcupuncture in the context of this review is defined as the needling\nof  specific  points  of  the  body.  It  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used\ncomplementary  therapies  in  many  countries  (Bodeker  2005).  For\nexample,  according  to  a  population-based  survey  in  2002  in  the\nUnited  States  of  America  (USA),  4.1%  of  respondents  reported\nlifetime use of acupuncture, and 1.1% reported recent use (Burke\n2006).  A  similar  survey  in  Germany  performed  in  the  same  year\nfound  that  8.7%  of  adults  between  18  and  69  years  of  age  had\nreceived acupuncture treatment in the previous 12 months (Härtel\n2004).  Acupuncture  was  originally  developed  as  part  of  Chinese\nmedicine  wherein  the  purpose  of  treatment  was  to  bring  the\npatient  back  to  the  state  of  equilibrium  postulated  to  exist  prior\nto  illness  (Endres  2007).  Some  acupuncture  practitioners  have\ndispensed  with  these  concepts  and  understand  acupuncture  in\nterms of conventional neurophysiology. Acupuncture is often used\nto  treat  headache,  especially  migraine.  For  example,  9.9%  of  the\nacupuncture users in the US survey mentioned above stated that\nthey  had  been  treated  for  migraine  or  other  headaches  (Burke\n2006).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nMany studies have shown that acupuncture has short-term effects\non  a  variety  of  physiological  variables  relevant  to  analgesia\n(Bäcker 2004; Endres 2007). However, it is unclear to what extent\nthese observations from experimental settings are relevant to the\nlong-term  effects  reported  by  practitioners.  It  is  assumed  that\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\na  variable  combination  of  local  effects;  spinal  and  supraspinal\nmechanisms; and cortical, psychological or 'placebo' mechanisms\ncontribute  to  the  clinical  effects  in  routine  care  (Carlsson  2002).\nWhile  there  is  little  doubt  that  acupuncture  interventions  cause\nneurophysiological  changes  in  the  organism,  the  traditional\nconcepts  of  acupuncture  involving  specifically  located  points\non  a  system  of  'channels'  called  meridians  are  controversial\n(Kaptchuk 2002). As for many non-pharmacological interventions,\nit  is  difficult  to  create  sham  interventions  for  acupuncture  which\nare  both  indistinguishable  and  physiologically  inert.  This  is  due\nboth  to  technical  reasons  and  the  unclear  mechanism  of  action.\nConsequently,  trials  using  sham  acupuncture  controls  must  be\ninterpreted  carefully,  as  sham  treatments  might  not  be  inactive\nplacebos, while trials comparing acupuncture with no prophylactic\ntreatment, prophylactic drugs or other interventions must also be\ninterpreted carefully, as they have a higher risk of bias due to lack\nof blinding.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nWhy it is important to do this review\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nDespite  acupuncture's  widespread  use  its  effectiveness  is  still\ndiscussed controversially (Da Silva 2015, McGeeney 2015).

We  used  these  data  to  ensure  that  we  obtained\nthe  most  precise  estimate  of  treatment  effect.  For  each  trial,  we\ncreated an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model for each numeric\noutcome at each time point and adjusted for the baseline value of\nthat outcome, treatment group (acupuncture or control), and any\nvariables  that  were  used  to  stratify  randomisation  in  the  original\ntrial. Using this model, we calculated the adjusted mean outcome\nvalues for each group (acupuncture and control), and we used the\nstandard error for the effect of treatment from the ANCOVA model\nto  calculate  the  standard  deviation  for  the  difference  in  adjusted\nmeans. Therefore, effect sizes calculated in our analyses might to\nsome degree deviate from those in the original publications of the\nsix  trials.

We  entered  any  additional  information  from  the  study\nauthors into the table, if it was available, , along with an indication\nthat  this  was  unpublished  information.  At  least  two  reviewers\nindependently  made  a  judgment  on  whether  the  risk  of  bias  for\neach criterion was considered low, high or unclear.

For  'selective  reporting',  we  decided  to  use  a\nmore  liberal  definition.  Headache  trials  typically  measure  a\nmultiplicity  of  headache  outcomes  at  several  time  points  using\ndiaries,  and  there  is  a  plethora  of  slightly  different  outcome\nmeasurement  methods.  While  a  single  primary  endpoint  is\nsometimes predefined, the overall pattern of a variety of outcomes\nis  necessary  to  get  a  clinically  interpretable  picture.

We considered trials as\nhaving a low risk of bias for selective reporting if they reported the\nresults of the most relevant headache outcomes assessed (typically\na frequency measure, intensity, analgesic use and response) for the\nmost relevant time points (end of treatment and, if done, follow-\nup), and if the outcomes and time points reported made it unlikely\nthat  study  investigators  had  picked  them  out  because  they  were\nparticularly favourable or unfavourable.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIf  trials  had  both  blinded  sham  control  groups  and  unblinded\ncomparison  groups  receiving  no  prophylactic  treatment  or  drug\ntreatment,  in  the  risk  of  bias  tables,  the  'Judgement'  column\nalways relates to the comparison with sham interventions. In the\n'Description'  column,  we  included  the  assessment  for  the  other\ncomparison group(s). As the risk of bias table does not include a\n'not  applicable'  option,  we  rated  the  item  'incomplete  follow-up\noutcome data addressed (four to 12 months after randomisation)?'\nas  'unclear'  for  trials  that  did  not  follow  participants  longer  than\nthree months.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe  also  assessed  the  adequacy  of  concealment  of  allocation\naccording  to  the  criteria  of  the  ATC  (Vickers  2010)  which  are\nstricter  than  those  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic\nReviews  of  Interventions.  In  particular,  in  the  case  of  envelope\nrandomisation, investigators must have established and described\ndetailed  procedures  to  ensure  that  allocation  could  neither  be\npredicted nor changed post hoc. For example, there should have\nbeen procedures to prevent investigators resealing and reusing an\nenvelope  after  it  had  been  opened  (e.g.  envelopes  were  held  by\nan independent party). As the level of information needed for this\nassessment was often not available in publications, we contacted\nstudy authors for clarification. If information was not available, we\ndid not consider adequacy of concealment to be \"unambiguously\nadequate\".\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe  also  attempted  to  provide  a  crude  estimate  of  the  quality  of\nacupuncture. At least two reviewers who are trained in acupuncture\nand  have  several  years  of  practical  experience  (GA,  BB,  YF,  AW)\nanswered  two  questions.  First,  they  were  asked  how  they  would\ntreat the participants included in the study. Answer options were\n'exactly  or  almost  exactly  the  same  way',  'similarly',  'differently',\n'completely  differently'  or  'could  not  assess'  due  to  insufficient\ninformation (on acupuncture or on the participants). Second, they\nwere  asked  to  rate  their  degree  of  confidence  that  acupuncture\nwas  applied  in  an  appropriate  manner  on  a  100-mm  visual  scale\n(with  0%  =  complete  absence  of  evidence  that  the  acupuncture\nwas appropriate, and 100% = total certainty that the acupuncture\nwas  appropriate).  A  member  of  the  review  team  (AW)  proposed\nthe  latter  method  ,  which  was  used  in  a  systematic  review\nof  clinical  trials  of  acupuncture  for  back  pain  (Ernst  1998).  In\nthe  Characteristics  of  included  studies  table,  the  acupuncturists'\nassessments  are  summarized  under  'Methods'  (for  example,\n\"similarly/70%\" indicates a trial where the acupuncturist-reviewer\nwould treat 'similarly' and is '70%' confident that acupuncture was\napplied appropriately).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nMain analysis\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOur  primary  efficacy  outcome  was  headache  frequency  at\ncompletion  of  treatment  and  at  follow-up  (closest  to  six  months\nafter randomisation). As studies may report either attacks, migraine\ndays  or  headache  days  as  a  measure  of  headache  frequency,\nwe  used  a  system  where  various  frequency  measures  could  be\nused.  As  available,  we  used  (in  descending  order  of  preference)\nabsolute values from four-week periods or other periods for (again,\nin descending order of preference) migraine days, migraine attacks\nor headache days. Due to the variability of outcomes, standardized\nmean  differences  (SMD)  were  calculated  as  effect  size  measures.\nNegative  values  indicate  better  outcomes  in  the  acupuncture\ngroup.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOur secondary efficacy outcome was the proportion of 'responders'\nat completion of treatment and at follow-up (closest to six months\nafter  randomisation).  Response  was  defined  as  a  reduction  in\nmigraine  days  of  at  least  50%  compared  to  baseline.  If  the\nnumber of responders regarding migraine days was not available\nwe  used  at  least  50%  reduction  in  number  of  migraine  attacks\n(second  preference),  or  at  least  50%  reduction  in  number  of\nheadache days (third preference). We calculated risk ratios (RR) of\nhaving a response and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as effect size\nmeasures. Risk ratios greater than 1 indicate that there were more\nresponders in the acupuncture group compared to the comparator\ngroup.  When  reporting  results  on  response  in  this  review  (in  the\nabstract, the plain language summary, the results section and the\n'Summary  of  findings'  tables)  these  are  based  on  the  observed\nproportion (sum of participants with response divided by the sum\nof participants randomized) in the control group and the expected\nproportion based on the pooled risk ratio from meta-analysis.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs primary safety/acceptability outcomes we used the number of\nparticipants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number of\nparticipants reporting at least one adverse event or effect. Further\nsafety/acceptability outcomes were the number of participants not\nreaching the primary endpoint (we originally had planned to extract\nthe number of participants dropping out but this proved difficult\ndue  to  multiple  measurement  time  points  and  reporting  issues)\nand  the  number  of  participants  with  serious  adverse  events.  As\nthe number of events was typically low we calculated odds ratios\n(OR) instead of risk ratios. Odds ratios greater than 1 indicate more\nevents (e.g. dropouts) in the acupuncture group.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nTime window analysis\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn  the  previous  version  of  this  review  (Linde  2009)  we  analysed\nfindings according to the four time windows described below. This\nhad  the  advantage  that  measurement  times  used  were  similar\nacross trials. However, it had two disadvantages. Firstly, duration\nof  treatment  periods  was  quite  variable,  so  while  in  some  trials\ntreatment  was  already  completed  (e.g.  at  8  weeks)  it  was  still\nongoing (e.g. until week 16) in others; secondly, four time windows\nfor  each  outcome  made  the  'Summary  of  findings'  tables  very\ncomplex.

Seven trials were\nperformed  in  Germany,  four  in  Italy,  three  in  Brazil,  two  each  in\nChina, Sweden and the UK, and one each in Denmark and Australia.\nSeven  trials  were  published  between  1989  and  2002  and  15\nbetween 2004 and 2015. We tried to contact corresponding authors\nof all trials at least once (either for previous versions of this review\nor for the current update). For one trial we could not obtain a valid\ncontact address (Hesse 1994) and three study authors or co-authors\ndid  not  provide  additional  information  before  completion  of  this\nupdate  (Wallasch  2012;  Weinschütz  1993;  Weinschütz  1994).  For\nthe remaining 18 trials we obtained some additional information.\nDetailed  additional  data  for  effect  size  calculation  was  obtained\nfrom study authors or from the individual patient database of the\nATC for 11 trials (Alecrim 2005; Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008; Allais\n2002; Diener 2006; Jena 2008; Li 2012; Linde K 2005; Streng 2006;\nVickers 2004; Vincent 1989).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFifteen  trials  included  participants  diagnosed  as  having  migraine\nwith  or  without  aura,  six  exclusively  participants  without  aura,\nand one recruited only women with menstrually-related migraine\n(Linde  M  2004).  In  two  large,  pragmatic  multicentre  trials  (Jena\n2008; Vickers 2004) baseline headache frequency and the reported\ndiagnoses  make  it  likely  that,  in  spite  of  the  use  of  the  criteria\nof the International Headache Society, there was some diagnostic\nmisclassification (i.e. some participants were likely to suffer from\ntension-type headache and not migraine). This applied to a minor\nextent also to three other multicenter trials (Diener 2006; Linde K\n2005; Streng 2006).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe acupuncture interventions tested in the included trials varied\nto  a  great  extent.

Most  trials  reporting  the\nduration  of  sessions,  left  needles  in  place  for  between  20  and  30\nminutes; one trial (Hesse 1994) investigated brief needling for a few\nseconds.  Electro-stimulation  of  needles  was  used  in  one  trial  (Li\n2012).  Agreement  among  acupuncturists  on  whether  they  would\ndo  acupuncture  similarly  to  that  used  in  the  study  assessed  and\nwhether  they  had  confidence  in  the  quality  of  the  acupuncture\nwas  low  (intra-class  correlation  coefficients  -0.08  and  0.24).  For\ntwo studies (Hesse 1994; Linde M 2004) both acupuncturists rating\nthe  study  had  50%  or  less  confidence  that  the  acupuncture  had\nadequate quality.

In  the  15  trials  with  a  sham  control,  techniques\nvaried  considerably.  Four  trials  superficially  needled  recognized\nacupuncture  points  considered  inadequate  for  the  treatment  of\nmigraine  (Alecrim  2005;  Alecrim  2006;  Alecrim  2008;  Zhao  2014);\nseven trials used needling (mostly superficial) of non-acupuncture\npoints  at  variable  distance  from  true  points  (Diener  2006;  Li\n2012;  Linde  K  2005;  Vincent  1989;  Wallasch  2012;  Weinschütz\n1993;  Weinschütz  1994).  Two  trials  (Facco  2008;  Linde  M  2004)\nused  'placebo'  needles  (telescopic  needles  with  blunt  tips  not\npenetrating  the  skin).  In  Linde  M  2004  these  were  placed  at  the\nsame predefined points as in the true treatment group. Facco 2008\nhad  two  sham  groups:  in  one  group  the  placebo  needles  were\nplaced  at  correct,  individualized  points  after  the  same  process\nof  Chinese  diagnosis  as  in  the  true  treatment  group.  In  the\nsecond group placebo needles were placed at standardized points\nwithout  the  'Chinese  ritual'  (to  investigate  whether  the  different\ninteraction and process affected outcomes). One study (Ceccherelli\n1992) used a complex procedure without real needling. One study\nused a mix of superficial needling at non-acupuncture points and\na  non-penetrating  technique  (with  a  blunted  cocktail  stick)  for\npoints on the head (Wang 2015). Five trials compared acupuncture\nto  prophylactic  drug  treatment,  using  metoprolol  (Hesse  1994;\nStreng  2006),  flunarizine  (Allais  2002),  valproic  acid  (Facco  2013)\nor individualized treatment according to guidelines (Diener 2006).\nIn  four  of  these  trials  participants  were  unblinded,  while  one\nblinded  trial  used  a  double-dummy  approach  (true  acupuncture\n+  metoprolol  placebo  vs.  metoprolol  +  sham  acupuncture;  Hesse\n1994).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nExcluded studies\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nResults  were  not  yet  available  for  eight  studies  registered  in  trial\nregistries likely to meet selection criteria.

Acupuncture is often used for migraine prevention but its effectiveness is still controversial. We present an update of our Cochrane review from 2009.   To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than sham (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic migraine.   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: 2016, issue 1); MEDLINE (via Ovid, 2008 to January 2016); Ovid EMBASE (2008 to January 2016); and Ovid AMED (1985 to January 2016). We checked PubMed for recent publications to April 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform to February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials.   We included randomized trials at least eight weeks in duration that compared an acupuncture intervention with a no-acupuncture control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham-acupuncture intervention, or prophylactic drug in participants with episodic migraine.   Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. The primary outcome was migraine frequency (preferably migraine days, attacks or headache days if migraine days not measured/reported) after treatment and at follow-up. The secondary outcome was response (at least 50% frequency reduction). Safety outcomes were number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and number of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. We calculated pooled effect size estimates using a fixed-effect model. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.   Twenty-two trials including 4985 participants in total (median 71, range 30 to 1715) met our updated selection criteria. We excluded five previously included trials from this update because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months, and included five new trials. Five trials had a no-acupuncture control group (either treatment of attacks only or non-regulated routine care), 15 a sham- acupuncture  control  group,  and  five  a  comparator  group  receiving  prophylactic  drug  treatment.  In  comparisons  with  no-acupuncture control groups and groups receiving prophylactic drug treatment, there was risk of performance and detection bias as blinding was not possible. Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate.   Acupuncture was associated with a moderate reduction of headache frequency over no acupuncture after treatment (four trials, 2199 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.56; 95% CI -0.65 to -0.48); findings were statistically heterogeneous (I2 = 57%; moderate quality evidence). After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 41% of participants receiving acupuncture and 17% receiving no acupuncture (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.40; 95% CI 2.08 to 2.76; 4 studies, 2519 participants) with a corresponding number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); there was no indication of statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 7%; moderate quality evidence). The only trial with post-treatment follow-up found a small but significant benefit 12 months after randomisation (RR 2.16; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.45; NNT 7; 95% 4 to 25; 377 participants, low quality evidence).   Both after treatment (12 trials, 1646 participants) and at follow-up (10 trials, 1534 participants), acupuncture was associated with a small but statistically significant frequency reduction over sham (moderate quality evidence). The SMD was -0.18 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.08; I2 = 47%) after treatment and -0.19 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.09; I2 = 59%) at follow-up. After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 50% of participants receiving true acupuncture and 41% receiving sham acupuncture (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.36; I2 = 48%; 14 trials, 1825 participants) and at follow-up in 53% and 42%, respectively (pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; I2 = 61%; 11 trials, 1683 participants; moderate  quality  evidence).  The  corresponding  NNTBs  are  11  (95%  CI  7.00  to  20.00)  and  10  (95%  CI  6.00  to  18.00),  respectively.  The number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 2.84; 95% CI 0.43 to 18.71; 7 trials, 931 participants; low quality evidence) and the number of participants reporting adverse effects (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; 4 trials, 1414 participants; moderate quality evidence) did not differ significantly between acupuncture and sham groups.   Acupuncture reduced migraine frequency significantly more than drug prophylaxis after treatment ( SMD -0.25; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.10; 3 trials, 739 participants), but the significance was not maintained at follow-up (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01; 3 trials, 744 participants; moderate quality evidence). After three months headache frequency at least halved in 57% of participants receiving acupuncture and 46% receiving prophylactic drugs (pooled RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44) and after six months in 59% and 54%, respectively (pooled RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; moderate quality evidence). Findings were consistent among trials with I2 being 0% in all analyses. Trial participants receiving acupuncture were less likely to drop out due to adverse effects (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.86; 4 trials, 451 participants) and to report adverse effects (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62; 5 trials 931 participants) than participants receiving prophylactic drugs (moderate quality evidence).   The  available  evidence  suggests  that  adding  acupuncture  to  symptomatic  treatment  of  attacks  reduces  the  frequency  of  headaches. Contrary  to  the  previous  findings,  the  updated  evidence  also  suggests  that  there  is  an  effect  over  sham,  but  this  effect  is  small.  The available trials also suggest that acupuncture may be at least similarly effective as treatment with prophylactic drugs. Acupuncture can be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment. As for other migraine treatments, long-term studies, more than one year in duration, are lacking.   P L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y   The available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for people with migraine.   Individuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half.   For this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update.   In four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain-killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only.   In 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake' acupuncture.  The  results  were  dominated  by  three  good  quality  large  trials  (with  about  1200  people)  showing  that  the  effect  of  true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects.   In five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less likely to drop out of the trial.   Our findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture.

Migraine  is  a  disorder  with  recurrent  headaches  manifesting  in attacks  lasting  from  four  to  72  hours.  Typical  characteristics  of the headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or  severe  intensity,  aggravation  by  routine  physical  activity  and association  with  nausea,  photophobia  or  phonophobia,  or  any combination of all three (IHS 2013). Epidemiological studies have consistently  shown  that  migraine  is  a  common  disorder  with a  one-year  prevalence  of  around  10%  to  12%  and  a  lifetime prevalence  of  between  15%  and  20%  (Oleson  2007).  In  Europe, the  economic  cost  of  migraine  is  estimated  at  EUR  27  billion  per year (Andlin-Sobocki 2005). Migraine is subclassified into the more frequent  episodic  migraine  (fewer  than  15  days  with  migrainous headaches  per  month)  and  the  less  frequent  chronic  migraine (more  than  15  days  per  month).  Most  people  with  migraine  can be  adequately  managed  by  treatingof  acute  headaches  alone, but  a  relevant  minority  need  prophylactic  interventions,  as  their attacks  are  either  very  frequent  or  are  insufficiently  controlled by acute therapy. Several drugs, such as propranolol, metoprolol, flunarizine,  valproic  acid  and  topiramate,  have  been  shown  to reduce  attack  frequency  in  some  people  (Dodick  2007;  Linde  M 2013a;  Linde  M  2013b),  however,  all  these  drugs  are  associated with adverse effects. Dropout rates in most clinical trials are high, suggesting that the drugs are not well accepted by patients. There is some evidence that behavioural interventions such as relaxation or biofeedback are beneficial (Holroyd 1990; Nestoriuc 2007), but additional effective, low-risk treatments are clearly desirable.   Acupuncture in the context of this review is defined as the needling of  specific  points  of  the  body.  It  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used complementary  therapies  in  many  countries  (Bodeker  2005).  For example,  according  to  a  population-based  survey  in  2002  in  the United  States  of  America  (USA),  4.1%  of  respondents  reported lifetime use of acupuncture, and 1.1% reported recent use (Burke 2006).  A  similar  survey  in  Germany  performed  in  the  same  year found  that  8.7%  of  adults  between  18  and  69  years  of  age  had received acupuncture treatment in the previous 12 months (Härtel 2004).  Acupuncture  was  originally  developed  as  part  of  Chinese medicine  wherein  the  purpose  of  treatment  was  to  bring  the patient  back  to  the  state  of  equilibrium  postulated  to  exist  prior to  illness  (Endres  2007).  Some  acupuncture  practitioners  have dispensed  with  these  concepts  and  understand  acupuncture  in terms of conventional neurophysiology. Acupuncture is often used to  treat  headache,  especially  migraine.  For  example,  9.9%  of  the acupuncture users in the US survey mentioned above stated that they  had  been  treated  for  migraine  or  other  headaches  (Burke 2006).   Many studies have shown that acupuncture has short-term effects on  a  variety  of  physiological  variables  relevant  to  analgesia (Bäcker 2004; Endres 2007). However, it is unclear to what extent these observations from experimental settings are relevant to the long-term  effects  reported  by  practitioners.  It  is  assumed  that   a  variable  combination  of  local  effects;  spinal  and  supraspinal mechanisms; and cortical, psychological or 'placebo' mechanisms contribute  to  the  clinical  effects  in  routine  care  (Carlsson  2002). While  there  is  little  doubt  that  acupuncture  interventions  cause neurophysiological  changes  in  the  organism,  the  traditional concepts  of  acupuncture  involving  specifically  located  points on  a  system  of  'channels'  called  meridians  are  controversial (Kaptchuk 2002). As for many non-pharmacological interventions, it  is  difficult  to  create  sham  interventions  for  acupuncture  which are  both  indistinguishable  and  physiologically  inert.  This  is  due both  to  technical  reasons  and  the  unclear  mechanism  of  action. Consequently,  trials  using  sham  acupuncture  controls  must  be interpreted  carefully,  as  sham  treatments  might  not  be  inactive placebos, while trials comparing acupuncture with no prophylactic treatment, prophylactic drugs or other interventions must also be interpreted carefully, as they have a higher risk of bias due to lack of blinding.   Why it is important to do this review   Despite  acupuncture's  widespread  use  its  effectiveness  is  still discussed controversially (Da Silva 2015, McGeeney 2015). Since the publication of the previous version of our Cochrane review (Linde 2009) a number of new trials have been published. Therefore, an update of the review was necessary. To sharpen the focus of our review  we  narrowed  our  selection  criteria.  In  particular,  we  now focus on episodic migraine.   To  investigate  whether  acupuncture  is  a)  more  effective  than  no prophylactic  treatment/routine  care  only;  b)  more  effective  than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in patients with episodic migraine.   Criteria for considering studies for this review   Types of studies   We included controlled trials investigating the prophylactic effect of  acupuncture  in  which  allocation  to  treatment  was  explicitly randomized,  and  in  which  participants  were  followed  up  for  at least eight weeks after randomisation. We excluded trials in which a  clearly  inappropriate  method  of  randomisation  was  used,  for example, open alternation.   Types of participants   We included trials in which study participants had been diagnosed with  episodic  migraine  (the  word  episodic  did  not  have  to  be mentioned  in  the  report  explicitly;  see  exclusion  criteria  below to  exclude  trials  focusing  on  chronic  migraine).  Studies  focusing on  migraine  but  including  participants  with  additional  tension- type  headache  were  included.  We  included  studies  including participants  with  headaches  of  various  types  (for  example,  some participants with migraine, some with tension-type headache) only if findings for participants with migraine were available separately, or if more than 90% of participants suffered from migraine.   The duration of the condition had to be longer than one year in the great majority (more than 80%) of participants. This criterion was considered met if:   • duration for longer than year was an inclusion criterion; or • the mean duration minus one standard deviation was more than   one year; or   than 10 years; or   • other information was presented that made it highly likely that the criterion was met (e.g. study authors presented proportions with duration ranges).   We excluded trials in patients with chronic migraine, chronic daily headache or in which at baseline more than half of participants had more than 15 days with migrainous headache per month. We also excluded trials in which there was no information of the duration of headache complaints.   In  this  update  of  the  review  we  have  excluded  trials  focusing on  chronic  migraine,  as  the  definition  of  chronic  migraine  is  still debated  and  the  separation  from  other  diagnoses,  for  example headache  due  to  medication  overuse,  is  difficult  (in  the  previous version of this review (Linde 2009) we were not aware of any trials on chronic migraine and they were not explicitly excluded). In the current  update  we  have  also  excluded  trials  in  which  a  relevant proportion of participants had been suffering from migraine for less than one year or in which duration was unclear.   • Any  treatment  involving  needle  insertion  (with  or  without manual  or  electrical  stimulation)  at  acupuncture  points,  pain points or trigger points, described as acupuncture. The planned treatment course must have had at least six treatment sessions, and been given at least once per week. Trials with individualised strategies  were  included  if  the  median  or  mean  number  of treatments was at least six sessions, and there was no reason to believe that treatments were given less frequently than once per week in the majority of participants.   * exclusively  investigated  acupuncture  at  specific  ‘micro- systems’  (e.g.  scalp  or  ear  acupuncture),  although  we included trials using micro-system points in addition to body acupuncture; investigated  other  methods  of  stimulating  acupuncture points  without  needle  insertion,  for  example,  acupressure, laser stimulation or transcutaneous electrical stimulation; injected fluids at acupuncture or trigger points.   • No  treatment  other  than  treatment  of  acute  migraine  attacks or  routine  care  (which  typically  includes  treatment  of  acute attacks, but might also include other treatments; however, trials normally  require  that  no  new  experimental  or  standardized treatment be initiated during the trial period).   interventions   'true' acupuncture/true treatment, but deviating in at least one aspect considered  important  by  acupuncture  theory,  such  as  skin penetration or correct point location).   (interventions  mimicking   • Prophylactic  pharmacological  treatment  (for  example,  β- blocking  agents,  calcium  channel  antagonists,  anti-epileptic drugs) given for at least eight weeks.   • We  excluded   food supplements, herbal drugs or combinations of herbal drugs, and trials that only compared different forms of acupuncture.   trials  comparing  acupuncture   Changes to previous version   In  the  previous  version  of  the  review  (Linde  2009)  we  included trials  using  any  prophylactic  treatment  other  than  acupuncture as  comparison.  With  a  slowly increasing  number  of  trials using  a  wide  range  of  different  treatments  (mainly  various herbal  medicines)  we  decided  to  concentrate  on  conventional prophylactic  pharmacological  treatment  to  keep  the  review focused.  We  have  defined  a  minimum  number  and  frequency  of acupuncture  treatment  sessions  to  ensure  that  treatments  meet basic quality criteria.   Types of outcome measures   We included studies if they measured at least one of the following outcome measures for at least eight weeks after randomisation:   • headache frequency (attacks, days, hours, headache-free days)   per defined time period;   • response  (≥  50%  frequency  reduction  documented   headache diary);   • disability or quality of life with a validated measure.   We excluded trials that:   • focussed on the treatment and measurement of acute attacks; • reported only measures such as “total effectiveness rate” (e.g. proportion  of  participants  healed,  much  improved,  improved, unchanged);   • reported only physiological or laboratory parameters; • had  outcome  measurement  periods  of  less  than  eight  weeks   (from randomisation to final observation).   Changes to previous version   We  have  defined  outcome  measures  more  precisely  to  ensure that  measurement  methods  meet  current  standards  of  migraine research.   Primary outcomes   The  primary  efficacy  outcome  of  our  systematic  review  was headache frequency at completion of treatment and at follow-up. The  primary  safety/acceptability  outcomes  were  the  number  of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number of participants reporting at least one adverse event or effect (see Measures of treatment effect for details).   Secondary outcomes   The  secondary  efficacy  outcome  of  our  systematic  review  was the proportion of 'responders' at completion of treatment and at follow-up.   For  this  update  we  searched  the  following  databases  without language restrictions (date of the last search 20 January 2016):   • Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL;  The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 1), searched from 2008 to 2016;   • MEDLINE (via Ovid) 2008 to week 1 of January 2016; • EMBASE (via Ovid) 2008 to 19 January 2016; • AMED (via OVID) 1985 to January 2016.   'acupuncture  AND   The  search  strategies  are  reported  in  Appendix  1.  In  addition, the  first  author  checked  PubMed  monthly  for  new  publications, screening  all  hits (headache  OR migraine)'  (last  search  12  April  2016).  For  previous  versions  of this  review  (Melchart  2001;  Linde  2009)  we  had  searched  the Cochrane  Complementary  Medicine  Field  Trials  Register  (whose results are now included in CENTRAL without relevant delay) and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials Register (no longer updated).   We  searched  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; apps.who.int/trialsearch/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov) for completed or ongoing trials  using  the  search  string  'acupuncture  AND  (headache  OR migraine)'.  The  last  search  was  on  February  10,  2016.  We  also searched  the  reference  lists  of  all  eligible  studies  for  additional studies.   Two review authors screened all abstracts identified by the updated search and excluded those that were clearly irrelevant (for example, studies  focusing  on  other  conditions,  reviews,  etc.).  We  obtained full  texts  of  all  remaining  references  and,  again,  screened  them to  exclude  clearly  irrelevant  papers.  At  least  two  review  authors formally  checked  all  remaining  articles  and  all  trials  included in  the  previous  version  of  our  review  (Linde  2009)  for  eligibility according to the above-mentioned selection criteria. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.   At  least  two  review  authors  independently  extracted  information on  participants,  methods,  interventions,  outcomes  and  results using  a  specially  designed  form  before  entry into  Review Manager (RevMan) (RevMan 2014). In particular, we extracted exact diagnoses;  headache  classifications  used;  number  and  type  of centres;  age;  sex;  duration  of  disease;  number  of  participants randomized,  treated  and  analysed;  number  of,  and  reasons  for dropouts; duration of baseline, treatment and follow-up periods; details  of  acupuncture  treatments  (such  as  selection  of  points; number,  frequency  and  duration  of  sessions;  achievement  of  de- chi (an irradiating feeling considered to indicate effective needling); number, training and experience of acupuncturists); and details of control interventions (sham technique, type and dosage of drugs). For details regarding methodological issues and study results, see below.   Where necessary, we sought additional information from the first or corresponding authors of the included studies.   For  six  trials  (Diener  2006;  Jena  2008;  Li  2012;  Linde  K  2005; Streng  2006;  Vickers  2004)  included  in  the  individual  patient database  of  the  Acupuncture  Trialists'  Collaboration  (ATC),  an international  collaborative  network  for  high  quality  randomized trials  of  acupuncture  for  chronic  pain  (see  Vickers  2010;  Vickers 2012),  we  obtained  uniformly  re-analysed  summary  data  for numeric  variables  and  the  number  of  responders  for  calculation of  effect  sizes.  We  used  these  data  to  ensure  that  we  obtained the  most  precise  estimate  of  treatment  effect.  For  each  trial,  we created an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model for each numeric outcome at each time point and adjusted for the baseline value of that outcome, treatment group (acupuncture or control), and any variables  that  were  used  to  stratify  randomisation  in  the  original trial. Using this model, we calculated the adjusted mean outcome values for each group (acupuncture and control), and we used the standard error for the effect of treatment from the ANCOVA model to  calculate  the  standard  deviation  for  the  difference  in  adjusted means. Therefore, effect sizes calculated in our analyses might to some degree deviate from those in the original publications of the six  trials.  Use  of  raw  data  also  allowed  us  to  calculate  response rates,  such  as  for  a  50%  reduction  in  pain,  even  if  this  was  not reported in the original trial publication.   Assessment of risk of bias in included studies   For the assessment of study quality, the risk of bias approach for Cochrane reviews was used (Higgins 2011). We used the following six separate criteria:   • adequate sequence generation; • allocation concealment; • blinding; • incomplete outcome data addressed (up to three months after   randomisation);   • incomplete  follow-up  outcome  data  addressed  (four  to  12   months after randomisation);   • free of selective reporting.   We did not include the item 'other potential threats to validity' in a formal manner, but noted if relevant flaws were detected.   In a first step, we copied information relevant to making a judgment on  a  criterion  from  the  original  publication  into  an  assessment table.  We  entered  any  additional  information  from  the  study authors into the table, if it was available, , along with an indication that  this  was  unpublished  information.  At  least  two  reviewers independently  made  a  judgment  on  whether  the  risk  of  bias  for each criterion was considered low, high or unclear. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.   For the first five criteria (above), we followed the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins  2011).  For  'selective  reporting',  we  decided  to  use  a more  liberal  definition.  Headache  trials  typically  measure  a multiplicity  of  headache  outcomes  at  several  time  points  using diaries,  and  there  is  a  plethora  of  slightly  different  outcome measurement  methods.  While  a  single  primary  endpoint  is sometimes predefined, the overall pattern of a variety of outcomes is  necessary  to  get  a  clinically  interpretable  picture.  If  we  had applied  the  strict  guidelines  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for   Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions,  almost  all  trials  would  have been rated 'unclear' for 'selective reporting'. We considered trials as having a low risk of bias for selective reporting if they reported the results of the most relevant headache outcomes assessed (typically a frequency measure, intensity, analgesic use and response) for the most relevant time points (end of treatment and, if done, follow- up), and if the outcomes and time points reported made it unlikely that  study  investigators  had  picked  them  out  because  they  were particularly favourable or unfavourable.   If  trials  had  both  blinded  sham  control  groups  and  unblinded comparison  groups  receiving  no  prophylactic  treatment  or  drug treatment,  in  the  risk  of  bias  tables,  the  'Judgement'  column always relates to the comparison with sham interventions. In the 'Description'  column,  we  included  the  assessment  for  the  other comparison group(s). As the risk of bias table does not include a 'not  applicable'  option,  we  rated  the  item  'incomplete  follow-up outcome data addressed (four to 12 months after randomisation)?' as  'unclear'  for  trials  that  did  not  follow  participants  longer  than three months.   We  also  assessed  the  adequacy  of  concealment  of  allocation according  to  the  criteria  of  the  ATC  (Vickers  2010)  which  are stricter  than  those  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic Reviews  of  Interventions.  In  particular,  in  the  case  of  envelope randomisation, investigators must have established and described detailed  procedures  to  ensure  that  allocation  could  neither  be predicted nor changed post hoc. For example, there should have been procedures to prevent investigators resealing and reusing an envelope  after  it  had  been  opened  (e.g.  envelopes  were  held  by an independent party). As the level of information needed for this assessment was often not available in publications, we contacted study authors for clarification. If information was not available, we did not consider adequacy of concealment to be \"unambiguously adequate\".   We  also  attempted  to  provide  a  crude  estimate  of  the  quality  of acupuncture. At least two reviewers who are trained in acupuncture and  have  several  years  of  practical  experience  (GA,  BB,  YF,  AW) answered  two  questions.  First,  they  were  asked  how  they  would treat the participants included in the study. Answer options were 'exactly  or  almost  exactly  the  same  way',  'similarly',  'differently', 'completely  differently'  or  'could  not  assess'  due  to  insufficient information (on acupuncture or on the participants). Second, they were  asked  to  rate  their  degree  of  confidence  that  acupuncture was  applied  in  an  appropriate  manner  on  a  100-mm  visual  scale (with  0%  =  complete  absence  of  evidence  that  the  acupuncture was appropriate, and 100% = total certainty that the acupuncture was  appropriate).  A  member  of  the  review  team  (AW)  proposed the  latter  method  ,  which  was  used  in  a  systematic  review of  clinical  trials  of  acupuncture  for  back  pain  (Ernst  1998).  In the  Characteristics  of  included  studies  table,  the  acupuncturists' assessments  are  summarized  under  'Methods'  (for  example, \"similarly/70%\" indicates a trial where the acupuncturist-reviewer would treat 'similarly' and is '70%' confident that acupuncture was applied appropriately).   Main analysis   Our  primary  efficacy  outcome  was  headache  frequency  at completion  of  treatment  and  at  follow-up  (closest  to  six  months after randomisation). As studies may report either attacks, migraine days  or  headache  days  as  a  measure  of  headache  frequency, we  used  a  system  where  various  frequency  measures  could  be used.  As  available,  we  used  (in  descending  order  of  preference) absolute values from four-week periods or other periods for (again, in descending order of preference) migraine days, migraine attacks or headache days. Due to the variability of outcomes, standardized mean  differences  (SMD)  were  calculated  as  effect  size  measures. Negative  values  indicate  better  outcomes  in  the  acupuncture group.   Our secondary efficacy outcome was the proportion of 'responders' at completion of treatment and at follow-up (closest to six months after  randomisation).  Response  was  defined  as  a  reduction  in migraine  days  of  at  least  50%  compared  to  baseline.  If  the number of responders regarding migraine days was not available we  used  at  least  50%  reduction  in  number  of  migraine  attacks (second  preference),  or  at  least  50%  reduction  in  number  of headache days (third preference). We calculated risk ratios (RR) of having a response and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as effect size measures. Risk ratios greater than 1 indicate that there were more responders in the acupuncture group compared to the comparator group.  When  reporting  results  on  response  in  this  review  (in  the abstract, the plain language summary, the results section and the 'Summary  of  findings'  tables)  these  are  based  on  the  observed proportion (sum of participants with response divided by the sum of participants randomized) in the control group and the expected proportion based on the pooled risk ratio from meta-analysis.   As primary safety/acceptability outcomes we used the number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number of participants reporting at least one adverse event or effect. Further safety/acceptability outcomes were the number of participants not reaching the primary endpoint (we originally had planned to extract the number of participants dropping out but this proved difficult due  to  multiple  measurement  time  points  and  reporting  issues) and  the  number  of  participants  with  serious  adverse  events.  As the number of events was typically low we calculated odds ratios (OR) instead of risk ratios. Odds ratios greater than 1 indicate more events (e.g. dropouts) in the acupuncture group.   Time window analysis   In  the  previous  version  of  this  review  (Linde  2009)  we  analysed findings according to the four time windows described below. This had  the  advantage  that  measurement  times  used  were  similar across trials. However, it had two disadvantages. Firstly, duration of  treatment  periods  was  quite  variable,  so  while  in  some  trials treatment  was  already  completed  (e.g.  at  8  weeks)  it  was  still ongoing (e.g. until week 16) in others; secondly, four time windows for  each  outcome  made  the  'Summary  of  findings'  tables  very complex.  Therefore,  in  this  update  we  have  reported  the  time window analyses as additional analyses only.   We used the following time windows:   • up to eight weeks/two months after randomisation; • three to four months after randomisation;   • five to six months after randomisation; and • more than six months after randomisation.   If more than one data point was available for a given time window, we used: for the first time window, preferably data closest to eight weeks; for the second window, data closest to the four weeks after completion  of  treatment  (for  example,  if  treatment  lasted  eight weeks, data for weeks nine to 12); for the third window, data closest to six months; and for the fourth window, data closest to 12 months.   • Frequency of migraine attacks (means and standard deviations) per four-week period. Mean differences were calculated as effect size measures   • Response (risk ratio of having a response). • Number of migraine days (means and standard deviations) per   four-week period (mean differences).   four-week period (mean differences).   • Headache  intensity  (any  measures  available,  extraction  of   means and standard deviations, calculation of SMDs).   • Frequency of analgesic use (any continuous or rank measures available,  extraction  of  means  and  standard  deviations, calculation of SMDs). • Headache scores (SMDs)   All these outcomes rely on participant reports, mainly collected in headache diaries.   If publications reported study findings with insufficient detail or in an inconsistent manner we attempted to obtain further information from the study authors.   Regarding missing participant data due to dropout or loss to follow- up in the included studies we used the following strategies.   for  comparisons  of  acupuncture  with  no  acupuncture  and sham  we  used  for  continuous  measures,  if  available,  the data  from  intention-to-treat  analyses  with  missing  values replaced; otherwise, we used the presented data on available cases; for response we used the number of responders divided by the  number  of  participants  randomized  to  the  respective group  (counting  missing  information  as  non-response).  In studies  comparing  acupuncture  with  drug  treatment,  we used  as  first  preference  analyses  of  participants  having  at least started treatment as first preference, available cases as second  preference  and  intention-to-treat  analyses  as  third preference.   for  all  comparisons  we  used  the  number  of  participants randomized  as  denominator  for  the  outcomes  number of  participants  dropping  out  due  to  adverse  effects,  not reaching  the  primary  endpoint  and  experiencing  serious adverse events;   for  the  outcome  number  of  participants  reporting  adverse effects we used the number of participants having received at least one treatment as denominator.   Assessment of heterogeneity   We assessed heterogeneity with the Chi2 test (Deeks 2011) and the I2 statistic (Higgins 2003).   Assessment of reporting biases   In  forest  plots  studies  are  ordered  according  to  their  weight  in meta-analysis. The weight depends on the standard errors of the point  estimate  (precision)  which  is  dependent  on  sample  size and  variability/frequency  of  events.  This  gives  readers  a  crude impression  whether  more  and  less  precise  trials  yield  similar findings.   Data synthesis   For  the  purposes  of  summarizing  results,  we  categorized  the included trials according to control groups:   • comparisons  with  no  acupuncture  (acute  treatment  only  or   routine care);   • comparisons with sham acupuncture interventions; • comparisons with prophylactic drug treatment.   If  a  trial  included  more  than  one  acupuncture  group,  we  pooled results of the groups so that participants in the control group were counted more than once.   We calculated pooled fixed-effect estimates, their 95% confidence intervals, the Chi2 test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic. If the P value of the Chi2 test for heterogeneity was less than 0.2 or I2 greater than 40%, or both, we also reported random-effects estimates.   Change to previous version   Based  on  the  recommendation  of  the  statistician  in  our  team (AV)  we  have  used  fixed-effect  models  for  calculating  pooled estimates  in  this  updated  review.  This  is  primarily  because  the fixed-effect analysis constitutes a valid test of the null hypothesis. Moreover, due to very large discrepancies in sample size, a random- effects model would have resulted in participants in small studies being  given  greater  weight  that  participants  in  large  studies.  . Nonetheless, if the P value of the Chi2 test for heterogeneity was less than 0.2 or I2 was greater than 40%, or both, we have also reported random-effect estimates.   We  used  the  GRADE  approach  to  assess  the  quality  of  evidence related  to  each  of  the  key  outcomes  as  appropriate  (GRADEpro GDT  2015;  Schünemann  2011).  GRADE  Working  Group  grades  of evidence are:   • High quality: we are very confident that the true effect lies close   to that of the estimate of the effect.   • Moderate  quality:  we  are  moderately  confident  in  the  effect estimate, the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. • Low quality: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.   • Very  low  quality:  we  have  very  little  confidence  in  the  effect estimate,  the  true  effect  is  likely  to  be  substantially  different from the estimate of effect.   To investigate  potential  sources  of  heterogeneity  and  the robustness  of  our  findings  we  performed  subgroup  analyses  for the primary outcome, headache frequency, and for the secondary outcome, response, both after treatment and at follow-up for the comparison vs. sham (the number of trials being too small for the other  two  comparisons)  for  four  variables.  These  variables  were selected after reviewing the trials qualitatively but before running analyses: unambiguously adequate randomisation vs. other; larger (sample  size  above  median  of  the  trials  included  in  the  analysis) vs. smaller trials; number of treatment sessions up to 12 vs. 16 and more; and sham penetrating the skin vs. non-penetrating sham.   Description of studies   Results of the search   Update  searches  identified  528  hits  (518  by  database  searches, six  by  checking  references  and  alerts,  and  four  from  checking entries in trials registries not identified otherwise). Thirty-six full- text  publications  and  four  entries  in  clinical  trial  registries  that were  deemed  potentially  eligible  were  formally  checked  against the eligibility criteria (see Figure 1). As we had modified selection criteria  for  this  update,  we  reassessed  the  22  trials  included  in the previous version for eligibility. Five new trials met the revised selection criteria (Facco 2013; Li 2012; Wallasch 2012; Wang 2015; Zhao 2014), while five trials included in the previous version or our review had to be excluded (Baust 1978; Doerr-Proske 1985; Dowson 1985;  Henry  1985;  Wylie  1997;  see  Characteristics  of  excluded studies).   Twenty-two trials including 4985 participants in total (median 71, range 30 to 1715) met our selection criteria; 18 studies were two- armed, two were three-armed and a further two were four-armed   (see  Characteristics  of  included  studies).  All  trials  used  parallel- group  designs;  there  were  no  cross-over  studies.  Fifteen  trials included a sham acupuncture control group (Alecrim 2005; Alecrim 2006;  Alecrim  2008;  Ceccherelli  1992;  Diener  2006;  Facco  2008;  Li 2012;  Linde  K  2005;  Linde  M  2004;  Vincent  1989;  Wallasch  2012; Wang  2015;  Weinschütz  1993;  Weinschütz  1994;  Zhao  2014),  five   a  no-acupuncture  control  group  (Facco  2008;  Jena  2008;  Linde  K 2005;  Linde  M  2000;  Vickers  2004),  and  five  a  comparator  group receiving  prophylactic  drug  treatment  (Allais  2002;  Diener  2006; Facco 2013; Hesse 1994; Streng 2006). Sixteen trials were performed in a single centre and six were multicentre trials. Seven trials were performed  in  Germany,  four  in  Italy,  three  in  Brazil,  two  each  in China, Sweden and the UK, and one each in Denmark and Australia. Seven  trials  were  published  between  1989  and  2002  and  15 between 2004 and 2015. We tried to contact corresponding authors of all trials at least once (either for previous versions of this review or for the current update). For one trial we could not obtain a valid contact address (Hesse 1994) and three study authors or co-authors did  not  provide  additional  information  before  completion  of  this update  (Wallasch  2012;  Weinschütz  1993;  Weinschütz  1994).  For the remaining 18 trials we obtained some additional information. Detailed  additional  data  for  effect  size  calculation  was  obtained from study authors or from the individual patient database of the ATC for 11 trials (Alecrim 2005; Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008; Allais 2002; Diener 2006; Jena 2008; Li 2012; Linde K 2005; Streng 2006; Vickers 2004; Vincent 1989).   Fifteen  trials  included  participants  diagnosed  as  having  migraine with  or  without  aura,  six  exclusively  participants  without  aura, and one recruited only women with menstrually-related migraine (Linde  M  2004).  In  two  large,  pragmatic  multicentre  trials  (Jena 2008; Vickers 2004) baseline headache frequency and the reported diagnoses  make  it  likely  that,  in  spite  of  the  use  of  the  criteria of the International Headache Society, there was some diagnostic misclassification (i.e. some participants were likely to suffer from tension-type headache and not migraine). This applied to a minor extent also to three other multicenter trials (Diener 2006; Linde K 2005; Streng 2006).   The acupuncture interventions tested in the included trials varied to  a  great  extent.  Five  trials  (Allais  2002;  Ceccherelli  1992;  Li 2012;  Wallasch  2012;  Zhao  2014  )  standardized  acupuncture treatments (all participants were treated at the same points); seven (Alecrim  2006;  Diener  2006;  Facco  2013;  Linde  K  2005;  Linde  M 2000;  Linde  M  2004;  Wang  2015)  semi-standardized  treatments (either  all  participants  were  treated  at  some  basic  points  and additional individualized points, or there were different predefined needling schemes depending on symptom patterns); and 10 trials individualized the selection of acupuncture points (Alecrim 2005; Alecrim  2008;  Facco  2008;  Hesse  1994;  Jena  2008;  Streng  2006; Vickers  2004;  Vincent  1989;  Weinschütz  1993;  Weinschütz  1994). The  number  of  treatment  sessions  was  between  six  and  12  in 13  trials,  and  16  or  more  in  nine  trials.  Most  trials  reporting  the duration  of  sessions,  left  needles  in  place  for  between  20  and  30 minutes; one trial (Hesse 1994) investigated brief needling for a few seconds.  Electro-stimulation  of  needles  was  used  in  one  trial  (Li 2012).  Agreement  among  acupuncturists  on  whether  they  would do  acupuncture  similarly  to  that  used  in  the  study  assessed  and whether  they  had  confidence  in  the  quality  of  the  acupuncture was  low  (intra-class  correlation  coefficients  -0.08  and  0.24).  For two studies (Hesse 1994; Linde M 2004) both acupuncturists rating the  study  had  50%  or  less  confidence  that  the  acupuncture  had adequate quality. For a further six studies (Ceccherelli 1992; Li 2012; Linde M 2000; Wallasch 2012; Weinschütz 1993; Weinschütz 1994) at least one acupuncturist gave a rating of 50% or lower. We could   not assess four trials using individualized treatments not described in detail (Alecrim 2005; Alecrim 2008; Facco 2008; Jena 2008).   Comparator interventions   Five  trials  included  a  group  which  either  received  treatment  of acute  attacks  only  (Facco  2008;  Linde  K  2005;  Linde  M  2000) or  'routine  care'  that  was  not  specified  by  protocol  (Jena  2008; Vickers 2004), while the experimental group received acupuncture in  addition.  In  the  15  trials  with  a  sham  control,  techniques varied  considerably.  Four  trials  superficially  needled  recognized acupuncture  points  considered  inadequate  for  the  treatment  of migraine  (Alecrim  2005;  Alecrim  2006;  Alecrim  2008;  Zhao  2014); seven trials used needling (mostly superficial) of non-acupuncture points  at  variable  distance  from  true  points  (Diener  2006;  Li 2012;  Linde  K  2005;  Vincent  1989;  Wallasch  2012;  Weinschütz 1993;  Weinschütz  1994).  Two  trials  (Facco  2008;  Linde  M  2004) used  'placebo'  needles  (telescopic  needles  with  blunt  tips  not penetrating  the  skin).  In  Linde  M  2004  these  were  placed  at  the same predefined points as in the true treatment group. Facco 2008 had  two  sham  groups:  in  one  group  the  placebo  needles  were placed  at  correct,  individualized  points  after  the  same  process of  Chinese  diagnosis  as  in  the  true  treatment  group.  In  the second group placebo needles were placed at standardized points without  the  'Chinese  ritual'  (to  investigate  whether  the  different interaction and process affected outcomes). One study (Ceccherelli 1992) used a complex procedure without real needling. One study used a mix of superficial needling at non-acupuncture points and a  non-penetrating  technique  (with  a  blunted  cocktail  stick)  for points on the head (Wang 2015). Five trials compared acupuncture to  prophylactic  drug  treatment,  using  metoprolol  (Hesse  1994; Streng  2006),  flunarizine  (Allais  2002),  valproic  acid  (Facco  2013) or individualized treatment according to guidelines (Diener 2006). In  four  of  these  trials  participants  were  unblinded,  while  one blinded  trial  used  a  double-dummy  approach  (true  acupuncture +  metoprolol  placebo  vs.  metoprolol  +  sham  acupuncture;  Hesse 1994).   Excluded studies   Results  were  not  yet  available  for  eight  studies  registered  in  trial registries likely to meet selection criteria. For four of these, detailed protocols  have  been  published  (Chen  2013;  Lan  2013;  Vas  2008; Zhang  2013);  for  the  other  four  only  the  registry  entries  were available (Li 2007; Liang 2013; Wang J 2015; Xing 2015). For at least four trials recruitment has been completed (Lan 2013; Li 2007; Vas 2008; Wang J 2015) (see Characteristics of ongoing studies).   Twenty  studies  (described  in  23  publications)  did  not  meet selection  criteria  (Agro  2005;  Boutouyrie  2010;  Ceccherelli  2012; Deng  2006;  Ferro  2012;  Foroughipour  2014;  Han  2011;  Jia  2009; Matra  2012;  Qin  2006;  Vijayalakshmi  2014;  Wang  2011;  Wu  2011; Yang 2009; Yang 2011; Zhang 2006; Zhang 2009; Zheng 2013; Zhong 2009;  Zhou  2007).  A  number  of  Chinese  trials  were  excluded  due to  inadequate  duration  of  prophylactic  drug  treatment  (several Chinese  trials  gave  flunarizine  or  other  drugs  for  four  weeks only),  overall  observation  of  less  than  eight  weeks,  inclusion  of participants  with  recent  onset  of  migraine,  and  lack  of  relevant outcome  measures.  Furthermore,  five  trials  included  in  the previous version of our review were excluded (Baust 1978; Doerr- Proske 1985; Dowson 1985; Henry 1985; Wylie 1997). Reasons for exclusions are reported in the Characteristics of excluded studies.   We classified three trials (five publications) identified by our most recent update search as awaiting assessment (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classification). One (Giannini 2015) is an abstract of  an  interim  analysis  of  a  trial  comparing  acupuncture  and individualized  prophylactic  drug  treatment.  The  abstract  does not  provide  sufficient  information  but  based  on  background information available to one of us (KL) it seems likely that the trial will  meet  our  eligibility  criteria  when  a  full  publication  with  final data becomes available. A second trial originating from China (Li 2016) was published in February and April 2016 after all analyses for  this  review  had  been  completed.  The  two  publications  focus on  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI)  outcomes  but also  report  headache  frequency  data  for  participants  completing   all  fMRI  measurements.  It  seems  likely  that  these  trials  will  meet inclusion criteria. A third trial of uncertain eligibility (participants with \"menstrual headache\") is available only in Chinese (Sun 2015). Full text translation has to be available before final assessment of eligibility.   Risk of bias in included studies   We  discuss  the  methodological  quality  of  trials  (risk  of  bias)  for the three comparisons separately, as problems differ according to control  groups.  The  risk  of  bias  assessments  of  single  trials  are displayed in Figure 2; a summary across trials is presented in Figure 3.  It  should  be  noted  that  three  trials  rated  unclear  for  the  item 'incomplete  follow-up  outcome  data'  actually  did  not  include  a follow-up (Ceccherelli 1992; Jena 2008; Zhao 2014).   Figure 2.   Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study. Note: for trials including both a comparison with sham and a no-acupuncture control/prophylactic drugs (Diener   2006, Facco 2008, Linde K 2005) blinding was assessed for the comparisons with sham. For the comparisons with no acupuncture/prophylactic drugs the risk of bias is high (no blinding).",

         "RATIONALE\nVisual impairment is a major health concern that predominantly impacts older adults due to age-related ocular diseases. Visual impairment affects more than 2200 million people worldwide and may lead to functional and psychological decline, emphasizing the need for effective self-management interventions. Self-management interventions aim to enhance individuals' abilities to manage their condition, maintain activities of daily living, and improve overall well-being.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of self-management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active (usual care) control interventions.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registries, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was on 19 May 2024.\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nWe included parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multifaceted self-management interventions in adults with acquired visual impairment (including dual sensory impairment).\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nOutcomes assessed were overall and subscores of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) scores at the end of follow-up, adverse events during the study period, and vision-related living performance measures at the end of follow-up.\n\n\nRISK OF BIAS\nWe assessed the risk of bias for three outcomes reported in a summary of findings table using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS METHODS\nWe synthesized results for each outcome using meta-analysis where possible, by calculating standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we provided a narrative summary of the results. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes.\n\n\nINCLUDED STUDIES\nWe included 20 parallel-group RCTs that enrolled 3151 participants. The size of studies ranged from 30 to 323 participants with a median of 153 participants. Studies were conducted in Asia (two studies), Australia (two), Europe (six), and North America (10) in academic medical centers, hospitals, low-vision clinics, private practice, rehabilitation centers, and Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The participants were older adults with a mean age across the included studies ranging from 60 to 84 years. The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity ranged from 0.15 to 1.11. Age-related macular degeneration was the predominant cause of low vision in 15 studies. We did not identify any eligible studies for adults with dual sensory impairment. One study was funded by industry, whereas others received a research grant or support from a non-profit organization or foundation. Multifaceted self-management interventions included in this review were diverse. The control group was placed on a wait list, while other active controls included usual care, optical aids, or low-vision rehabilitation.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS OF RESULTS\nWe rated the overall risk of bias of included studies as low or some concerns. The meta-analysis revealed consistent findings across different outcomes and comparisons. For HRQoL, evidence suggests that self-management intervention may result in little to no difference in HRQoL (change score: SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.15; I2 = 46%; 3 studies, 568 participants; final value: SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.08; I2 = 31%; 3 studies, 459 participants; low-certainty evidence). This finding remained consistent regardless of whether wait list or active control was the comparator. For VRQoL, multifaceted self-management interventions may result in little to no difference in VRQoL change score compared to active control (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.10; I2 = 48%; 4 studies, 733 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence from six studies by final values suggests that self-management intervention may not improve VRQoL compared to control treatment in the longer-term (6 to 24 months) (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.13; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 864 participants; low-certainty evidence). The conclusion was unchanged, irrespective of the comparator used. We judged the certainty of evidence for both HRQoL and VRQoL as low according to GRADE criteria, downgrading one level for imprecision and one level for unexplained heterogeneity. For harms, self-management interventions may not affect the risk of adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.66; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 255 participants; low-certainty evidence). Of four studies that reported adverse events, three studies observed no treatment-related adverse events. One study referred 12 (34%) participants to the general medical practitioner for depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared with seven (22%) participants in the wait list comparison group.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nIn this review, we found low-certainty evidence that multifaceted self-management interventions have little or no effects on improving HRQoL and VRQoL for adults with visual impairment. Research is needed to develop more sensitive measures of quality of life and to assess the benefit of such interventions across a broader demographic, including different stages of vision impairment and people with dual-sensory impairment.\n\n\nFUNDING\nCochrane Eyes and Vision US Project is supported by grant UG1EY020522, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health.\n\n\nREGISTRATION\nProtocol available via doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015790.",

While vision loss can affect people of all ages, the\nmajority of those with vision impairment are over the age of 50 with\nage-related ocular disease. Furthermore, the number of individuals\naffected by vision impairment is expected to exponentially increase\nas the population ages (Chan 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe  main  causes  of  vision  impairment  are  uncorrected  refractive\nerror,  cataract,  macular  degeneration,  glaucoma,  and  diabetic\nretinopathy  (GBD  2021).  In  most  cases,  these  conditions  are\nprogressive in nature, which may lead to functional impairment in\nactivities of daily living and loss of independence and quality of life.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nVisually impaired adults are more likely to be older, unemployed,\nand  have  lower  income  (Varadaraj  2021).  In  addition,  visual\nimpairment  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  mortality,  as  a\ndecline in functional ability in instrumental activities of daily living\nare  experienced  (Christ  2014).  To  understand  and  address  health\ndisparities associated with a decline in visual acuity, we may begin\nby  addressing  the  functional  concerns  of  these  individuals  and\nwhich interventions are effective to bridge these gaps.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThere  are  many  definitions  for  visual  impairment.  In  this  review,\nwe  will  use  the  definition  determined  by  the  International\nClassification  of  Diseases  11,  which  states:  “A  vision  impairment\nresults  when  an  eye  condition  affects  the  visual  system  and  one\nor more of its vision functions. Typically, population-based surveys\nmeasure  visual  impairment  using  exclusively  visual  acuity,  with\nseverity  categorized  as  mild,  moderate  or  severe  distance  vision\nimpairment or blindness, and near vision impairment. However, in\nthe clinical setting, other visual functions are also often assessed,\nsuch  as  a  person’s  field  of  vision,  contrast  sensitivity  and  color\nvision”  (WHO  2022a).  This  definition  is  consistent  with  previous\nstudies in the literature, and it is broad enough to ensure that the\nreview will capture the majority of those with visual impairment.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn  this  review,  we  define  self-management  as  the  skills  and\nresources  for  an  individual  to  manage  the  practical,  social,  and\nemotional  consequences  of  their  condition.  Self-management\ninterventions  focus  on  teaching  skills  that  allow  individuals  to\nbetter  manage  their  chronic  condition,  and  thereby  optimize\ntheir  health  and  well-being  (Jonkman  2016).  The  aim  of  self-\nmanagement  is  to  teach  people  to  cope  with  their  visual\ndisabilities  to  maximize  their  activities  of  daily  living.  Self-\nmanagement can include the use of low-vision devices, improving\nvisual  skills\nin  conjunction  with  occupational  therapy,  and\nother  guided  interventions.  People  with  low  vision  may  receive\nrecommendations  from  their  low-vision  specialist  for  ways  that\nthey  can  engage  in  self-management.  They  may  also  encounter\nthese  types  of  strategies  through  support  groups  or  other\neducational programs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSelf-management  is  defined  in  various  sectors  of  healthcare  as\nthe  support  provided  to  patients  with  one  or  more  chronic\nmedical  conditions  which  enables  and  empowers  them  to  place\nan active role in managing their own health on a day-to-day basis\n(Grady 2014). Interventions to promote self-management may also\nincrease an individual's ability to solve problems, make decisions,\nand  develop  action  plans  for  specific  goals.  By  evaluating  self-\nmanagement strategies in vision impairment, we may expect to see\nan improvement in visual functioning and independence, therefore\nenhancing patients’ quality of life.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe define health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as an individual’s\nor  a  group’s  perceived  physical,  mental,  and  social  health  over\ntime  (CDC  2023).  HRQOL  measures  are  used  to  represent  the\nqualitative  experience  with  a  disease  pre-  and  postintervention.\nGeneric HRQOL measures are not always sensitive to vision-specific\nfunctionality, thus research in this population can include vision-\nrelated  quality  of  life  (VRQOL)  measures  to  capture  the  complex\ntrait  that  encompasses  visual  functioning,  symptoms,  emotional\nwell-being, social relationships, and concerns that are specific to\nvision loss (Lamoureux 2011). These vision-specific domains may\nnot be adequately represented in a generic measure, therefore we\nwill apply both HRQOL and VRQOL in our review.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nWhy it is important to do this review\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThis  review  is  important  to  determine  how  quality  of  life  is\naffected by self-management interventions to improve the social,\npsychological, economic, and cognitive burdens on those affected\nby visual impairment (CDC 2022). This study is important for vision\nhealth professionals to better understand the most effective self-\nmanagement  intervention  for  visually  impaired  patients  so  that\nwe  can  provide  more  effective  care.  Currently,  there  are  scarcely\nany  published  systematic  reviews  that  use  quality  of  life  as  a\nmetric,  therefore  this  is  an  important  metric  that  needs  to  be\nconsidered.  Additionally,  this  metric  is  of  importance  due  to  the\ngrowing interest of governments and health insurance companies\nin assessing quality of life as an outcome measure.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nO B J E C T I V E S\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe  objective  of  this  review  is  to  assess  the  impact  of  self-\nmanagement interventions on quality of life in adults with visual\nimpairment compared with inactive or active (usual care) control\ninterventions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nM E T H O D S\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nTypes of studies\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating self-\nmanagement interventions for individuals with visual impairment\ncompared  to  inactive  interventions  or  usual  care.

Self-management interventions for quality of life in adults with visual impairment (Protocol). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2023, Issue 9. Art. No.: CD015790. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD015790.   Copyright © 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.   This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows:   The objective of this review is to assess the impact of self-management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active (usual care) control interventions.   How the intervention might work   According to the World Health Organization, at least 2,200 million people  are  affected  by  vision  impairment  globally  (WHO  2022). Vision impairment is one of the leading causes of disability, posing a  significant  financial  burden  on  healthcare  systems  across  the globe (GBD 2018). While vision loss can affect people of all ages, the majority of those with vision impairment are over the age of 50 with age-related ocular disease. Furthermore, the number of individuals affected by vision impairment is expected to exponentially increase as the population ages (Chan 2018).   The  main  causes  of  vision  impairment  are  uncorrected  refractive error,  cataract,  macular  degeneration,  glaucoma,  and  diabetic retinopathy  (GBD  2021).  In  most  cases,  these  conditions  are progressive in nature, which may lead to functional impairment in activities of daily living and loss of independence and quality of life.   Visually impaired adults are more likely to be older, unemployed, and  have  lower  income  (Varadaraj  2021).  In  addition,  visual impairment  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  mortality,  as  a decline in functional ability in instrumental activities of daily living are  experienced  (Christ  2014).  To  understand  and  address  health disparities associated with a decline in visual acuity, we may begin by  addressing  the  functional  concerns  of  these  individuals  and which interventions are effective to bridge these gaps.   There  are  many  definitions  for  visual  impairment.  In  this  review, we  will  use  the  definition  determined  by  the  International Classification  of  Diseases  11,  which  states:  “A  vision  impairment results  when  an  eye  condition  affects  the  visual  system  and  one or more of its vision functions. Typically, population-based surveys measure  visual  impairment  using  exclusively  visual  acuity,  with severity  categorized  as  mild,  moderate  or  severe  distance  vision impairment or blindness, and near vision impairment. However, in the clinical setting, other visual functions are also often assessed, such  as  a  person’s  field  of  vision,  contrast  sensitivity  and  color vision”  (WHO  2022a).  This  definition  is  consistent  with  previous studies in the literature, and it is broad enough to ensure that the review will capture the majority of those with visual impairment.   In  this  review,  we  define  self-management  as  the  skills  and resources  for  an  individual  to  manage  the  practical,  social,  and emotional  consequences  of  their  condition.  Self-management interventions  focus  on  teaching  skills  that  allow  individuals  to better  manage  their  chronic  condition,  and  thereby  optimize their  health  and  well-being  (Jonkman  2016).  The  aim  of  self- management  is  to  teach  people  to  cope  with  their  visual disabilities  to  maximize  their  activities  of  daily  living.  Self- management can include the use of low-vision devices, improving visual  skills in  conjunction  with  occupational  therapy,  and other  guided  interventions.  People  with  low  vision  may  receive recommendations  from  their  low-vision  specialist  for  ways  that they  can  engage  in  self-management.  They  may  also  encounter these  types  of  strategies  through  support  groups  or  other educational programs.   Self-management  is  defined  in  various  sectors  of  healthcare  as the  support  provided  to  patients  with  one  or  more  chronic medical  conditions  which  enables  and  empowers  them  to  place an active role in managing their own health on a day-to-day basis (Grady 2014). Interventions to promote self-management may also increase an individual's ability to solve problems, make decisions, and  develop  action  plans  for  specific  goals.  By  evaluating  self- management strategies in vision impairment, we may expect to see an improvement in visual functioning and independence, therefore enhancing patients’ quality of life.   We define health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as an individual’s or  a  group’s  perceived  physical,  mental,  and  social  health  over time  (CDC  2023).  HRQOL  measures  are  used  to  represent  the qualitative  experience  with  a  disease  pre-  and  postintervention. Generic HRQOL measures are not always sensitive to vision-specific functionality, thus research in this population can include vision- related  quality  of  life  (VRQOL)  measures  to  capture  the  complex trait  that  encompasses  visual  functioning,  symptoms,  emotional well-being, social relationships, and concerns that are specific to vision loss (Lamoureux 2011). These vision-specific domains may not be adequately represented in a generic measure, therefore we will apply both HRQOL and VRQOL in our review.   Why it is important to do this review   This  review  is  important  to  determine  how  quality  of  life  is affected by self-management interventions to improve the social, psychological, economic, and cognitive burdens on those affected by visual impairment (CDC 2022). This study is important for vision health professionals to better understand the most effective self- management  intervention  for  visually  impaired  patients  so  that we  can  provide  more  effective  care.  Currently,  there  are  scarcely any  published  systematic  reviews  that  use  quality  of  life  as  a metric,  therefore  this  is  an  important  metric  that  needs  to  be considered.  Additionally,  this  metric  is  of  importance  due  to  the growing interest of governments and health insurance companies in assessing quality of life as an outcome measure.   The  objective  of  this  review  is  to  assess  the  impact  of  self- management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active (usual care) control interventions.   Criteria for considering studies for this review   Types of studies   We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating self- management interventions for individuals with visual impairment compared  to  inactive  interventions  or  usual  care.  Cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs will also be eligible for inclusion. We will exclude cross-over  RCTs  because  self-management  intervention  can  lead to permanent or long-term modification to participants, and carry- over effect cannot be ignored. We will not exclude studies on the basis of publication status or language of publication.   We  will  include  any  study  with  adult  participants  utilizing  self- management  therapy  for  acquired  visual  impairment,  including dual  sensory  impairment.  There  will  be  no  limits  on  etiology  or onset of diagnosis. We will exclude participants less than 18 years of  age  and  those  with  congenital  forms  of  visual  impairment. We  will  only  include  participants  with  congenital  forms  of  visual impairment  if  separate  data  on  participants  with  acquired  visual impairment are reported.   We will include any self-management interventions that are used to enhance visual function and improve patient-reported outcomes secondary  to  visual  impairment.  The  intervention,  which  could be  delivered  to  an  individual  or  group,  must  contain  at  least one  of  the  following  components:  problem-solving,  goal-setting, decision-making,  self-monitoring,  coping  with  the  condition,  or an alternative method designed to facilitate behavior change and improvements in physical and psychological functioning. There is no minimum time frame for the duration of the intervention.   • Education-based approach to patient or caretakers, or both • Psychological support—professional/family/friends • Interventions promoting greater usage of low-vision aids, such   as: ◦ magnifiers; ◦ reading glasses; ◦ video magnifiers; ◦ screen readers; ◦ assistive technology.   ◦ Behavioral activation ◦ Home management   Self-management  interventions  as  defined  here  do  not  include training  through  telerehabilitation  or  residential  and/or  weekly rehabilitation programs.   We  will  categorize  outcomes  reported  up  to  six  months  after baseline  as  short-term  review  outcomes,  and  outcomes  reported more than six months after baseline as long-term review outcomes.   The  critical  outcomes  for  this  review  are  the  mean  change  in (1)  generic  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQOL)  and  (2)  overall vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) scores up to six months from baseline. We will evaluate studies that had assessed quality of life using validated questionnaires that were completed by the person affected, a caregiver, or a close relative (Langelaan 2007).   • Vision-related  quality  of   • Visual function (Activity Inventory (Massof 2007), Veterans Affairs Low-Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire-48 (VA LV VFQ-48) (Stelmack 2006), Impact on Vision Impairment (IVI) (Weih 2002)) (Low  Vision  Quality-of-Life life Questionnaire (LVQOL) (Wolffsohn 2000), National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25) (Mangione 2001)) • Psychological  well-being  (Geriatric  Depression  Scale  (GDS) (Yesavage  1982),  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9) (Kroenke  2001),  General  Anxiety  Disorder-7  (GAD-7)  (Spitzer 2006))   • Health-related quality of life (36-item Short Form Health Survey   (SF-36) version 2 (Ware 1992), EQ-5D (EuroQoL 1990))   Important outcomes   We will assess the following important outcomes reported up to six months from baseline, or at the longest follow-up time of the study if the outcomes are not reported within six months.   • Mean  change  in  subscores  in  HRQOL  and  VRQOL  including physical  functioning,  social  functioning,  emotional  distress, feelings  of  depression  and  anxiety.  If  quality  of  life  measures include  only  a  single  domain,  we  will  use  overall  scores  as subscores.   • Mean  change  in  vision-related  living  performance  measures   from baseline: ◦ reading speed; ◦ Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Owsley 2001); ◦ tracing speed; ◦ facial recognition; ◦ mobility outcomes.   • Proportion of participants who experienced any adverse events (AEs) during the intervention period. Because AEs are unlikely to be intervention related, we will extract all AEs reported by the included studies.   Search methods for identification of studies   The  Cochrane  Eyes  and  Vision  Information  Specialist  will  search the following electronic databases for RCTs and controlled clinical trials.   Electronic searches   We  will  search  the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL)  (which  contains  the  Cochrane  Eyes  and  Vision Trials  Register)  (latest  issue),  Ovid  MEDLINE  (All)  (January  1946 to  present),  Embase.com  (January  1947  to  present),  PubMed (1946 to present), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature  Database  (LILACS)  (1982  to  present),  ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov),  and  the  World  Health  Organization (WHO)  International  Clinical  Trials  Registry  Platform  (ICTRP) (trialsearch.who.int/).  We  will  not  use  any  date  or  language restrictions in the electronic search for trials.   See:  Appendices  for  details  of  search  strategies  for  CENTRAL (Appendix  1),  MEDLINE  (Appendix  2),  Embase.com  (Appendix 3),  PubMed  (Appendix  4),  LILACS  (Appendix  5),  ClinicalTrials.gov (Appendix 6), and the ICTRP (Appendix 7).   We will search the reference lists of included studies for additional trials. We will not search conference abstracts for the purposes of this review.   After removal of duplicates, two review authors will independently screen  the  titles  and  abstracts  of  all  records  identified  by  the searches  using  Covidence  software  (Covidence).  We  will  classify each record as ‘relevant,’ ‘possibly relevant,’ or ‘not relevant’ based on  the  eligibility  criteria.  We  will  obtain  full-text  copies  of  all relevant  or  possibly  relevant  studies,  and  assess  these  according to  the  Criteria  for  considering  studies  for  this  review  outlined above.  Two  review  authors  will  independently  evaluate  the  full- text  articles  for  inclusion  in  the  review.  We  will  merge  multiple reports published on the same primary study. A third review author will resolve any disagreements or discrepancies between the two review authors through discussion and consensus.   Two  review  authors  will  independently  extract  data  from  the included  studies  using  the  data  extraction  form  developed  by Cochrane  Eyes  and  Vision  US  Project  (CEV@US)  in  Covidence (Covidence). We will extract the following information.   • Study design and unit of allocation • Participants (inclusion/exclusion criteria, number randomized,   participant characteristics, withdrawals and exclusions)   delivering the intervention, delivery method and duration   We will collect data in sufficient detail to facilitate description of the included studies, construct tables and figures, assess risk of bias, and conduct synthesis.   We  will  contact  study  authors  to  request  missing  information or  for  clarification.  If  the  authors  do  not  respond  within  two weeks,  we  will  proceed  with  the  available  information.  In  case of  any  discrepancies  in  data  extraction  between  review  authors, consensus  will  be  reached  through  discussion  or  adjudication with  an  additional  review  author  if  necessary.  After  we  reach consensus,  one  review  author  will  export  the  collated  data  into Review  Manager  Web  (RevMan  Web  2022),  and  a  second  review author will verify the data entry.   Two  review  authors  will  independently  assess  risk  of  bias  for the  critical  outcomes,  generic  HRQOL  change  scores  and  VRQOL change  scores,  using  Cochrane's  RoB  2  tool,  Sterne  2019,  as described  in  Chapter  8  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2022). In case of disagreement, an adjudicator will resolve the discrepancy.   • bias arising from the randomization process; • bias introduced by deviations from intended interventions; • bias arising from missing outcome data;   • bias in measurement of the outcome; • bias in selection of the reported result.   We  will  present  an  overall  risk  of  bias  assessment  for  each  trial based on the assessments across the five domains. The overall risk of bias will have three categories: ‘low risk of bias,’ ‘high risk of bias,’ or ‘some concerns.’   If  we  include  any  cluster-randomized  trials,  we  will  use  the  RoB 2  tool  for  cluster-randomized  trials.  We  will  assess  risk  of  bias following the guidance in Chapter 23 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions regarding including variants on randomized trials (Higgins 2022a). We will add one more domain to  assess  the  bias  arising  from  the  timing  of  identification  and recruitment of participants for cluster-randomized trials.   Measures of treatment effect   We will conduct data analysis following the guidance in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2022b). For the data on the quality of life questionnaire, we will collect the data separately as a total score (mean and standard deviation) and as the subscores on the questionnaire.   We will summarize the results as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where studies used the same quality of life tool across studies. Alternatively, we will use the standardized mean  difference  (SMD)  with  95%  CIs  where  studies  employed different  tools.  We  will  express  point  estimates  for  dichotomous outcomes (e.g. adverse events) as risk ratio (RR) (Higgins 2022a).   Where  it  is  not  possible  to  summarize  results  as  above,  we  will report the results narratively.   Unit of analysis issues   The  unit  of  analysis  for  critical  and  other  important  outcomes will  be  the  study  participant.  If  the  unit  of  randomization  is  a group of participants (e.g. randomization per clinic) rather than a participant, as in cluster-RCTs, a unit of analysis issue will occur. We will refer to Chapter 23 of the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for guidance regarding including variants on randomized trials (Higgins 2022a).   Dealing with missing data   If  data  are  missing  from  a  paper  or  difficult  to  interpret,  we  will contact  the  study  authors  to  request  the  information  of  interest. If  the  study  investigators  do  not  respond  within  two  weeks,  we will proceed with the available information and assess the impact of  the  missing  data  on  the  overall  interpretation  of  results.  If precision measures (e.g. standard deviations) are not provided in the included studies, we will impute them by using the information from  the  studies  (e.g.  confidence  intervals  and  exact  P  values). Except for the imputation of precision measures, we will not impute other data on our own. In dealing with missing data, we will follow the recommendations in Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2022).   Assessment of heterogeneity   Before  combining  data  in  a  meta-analysis,  we  will  assess  studies for  clinical  heterogeneity  such  as  variations  in  participants, interventions, outcomes, and time points. We will assess statistical heterogeneity  by  using  the  I2  statistic  as  recommended  in   Chapter  10  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of Interventions (Deeks 2022). We will use the following thresholds for the interpretation of I2:   • 0% to 40%: might not be important; • 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; • 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; • 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.   We  will  examine  the  risk  of  reporting  bias  by  comparing  the outcomes  defined  in  the  trial  protocol  or  trial  registration  with those  presented  in  the  full-text  publication/report  of  the  study according to the signaling questions in the relevant domain of the RoB 2 tool. If we identify sufficient randomized trials (> 10), we will examine the potential for publication bias using a funnel plot (Egger 1997).   Where  we  consider  studies  to  be  sufficiently  similar  in  terms  of study  populations  and  design,  we  will  conduct  a  meta-analysis using  a  random-effects  model.  If  fewer  than  three  small  studies are included, we will use a fixed-effect model (Deeks 2022). If we include  multi-arm  studies,  we  will  combine  groups  to  create  a single  pair-wise  comparison.  If  we  are  unable  to  conduct  meta- analysis due to substantial heterogeneity, we will report a narrative or tabulated summary of the data.   If we include cluster-randomized or cross-over trials, we will follow the additional guidance in Chapter 23 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2022a).   In the case of sufficient data (> 10 trials), we will perform subgroup analyses on the critical outcomes by:   • etiology  of  visual  impairment  (e.g.  glaucoma,  age-related   macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy);   • participant  age  of  onset  of  visual  impairment  (working-age   population versus elderly population (e.g. ≥ 65 years));   • length  of  diagnosis  (newly  diagnosed:  within  last  six  months   versus established diagnosis: greater than six months).   We will undertake sensitivity analyses by excluding studies judged as having an overall high risk of bias. We will compare the results to determine whether this changes the effect estimate.   We  will  present  summary  of  findings  tables  to  provide  key information  concerning  the  certainty  of  evidence,  the  magnitude   of  effect  of  the  interventions  examined,  and  the  summary  of  the available data on the two critical outcomes, generic HRQOL change scores and overall VRQOL change scores, reported up to six months postintervention  and  adverse  events  at  the  end  of  follow-up.  We will follow the guidelines in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Schünemann 2022).   Two  review  authors  will  independently  perform  the  GRADE assessment  to  evaluate  the  certainty  of  the  review  findings.  We will grade the certainty of evidence of 'high,' 'moderate,' 'low,' or 'very  low'  based  on  (i)  high  risk  of  bias  among  included  studies, (ii)  indirectness  of  evidence,  (iii)  unexplained  heterogeneity  or inconsistency  of  results,  (iv)  imprecision  of  results,  and  (v)  high probability of publication bias. For outcomes not specified for RoB 2 assessment, the GRADE assessment will be informed by study-level risk of bias assessment.

Many data mining methods with different\nmerits exist, but the very first step is often to simply consider as data what was previously considered a\nmere by-product of a process. One of the first historical examples of uncovering new knowledge from\npre-existing data was Florence Nightingale’s (1820-1910) demonstration that soldiers died more often\nfrom bad sanitary conditions in military hospitals than from battle wounds. For her demonstration, she\ngathered previously ignored data and presented it in revealing graphics. This example demonstrates that\ndata mining is itself a process with important questions, from the selection and gathering of data to the\npresentation  of  the  results.  In  the  fault  localization  context,  the  following  questions  emerge:  which\nexisting data can be leveraged to improve the localization? Which presentation of the results is best\nsuited  for  the  debugging  process?  In  this  chapter,  we  will  illustrate  the  basic  concepts  of  fault\nlocalization using a data mining technique and present three approaches to locate the faulty statements\nof a program. We will also address how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI\ncomponents.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAs software engineering data are symbolic by nature, in this chapter, we will present fault localization\nusing symbolic methods. Symbolic methods tend to lend themselves naturally to give explanations, and\nthis is exactly what we are looking for in fault localization. Indeed, we prefer a system with the capacity\nof saying “the failure has to do with the initialization of variable x” to a system limited to saying “the\nfault is in these million lines with probability 0.527”. Therefore, we will illustrate how to use two data\nmining techniques: association rules and formal concept analysis in fault localization.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFormal concept analysis and association rules deal with collections of objects and their features. The\nformer extracts contextual truth, such as “in this assembly, all white-haired female wear glasses”, while\nthe latter extracts relativized truth, such as “in this assembly, carrying a briefcase increases the chance\nof wearing a tie”. In a fault localization context, the former could say that “all failed tests call method\nm”, and the latter could discover that “most failed tests call method m, which is very seldom called in\npassed tests”.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThroughout this chapter, we use the Trityp program (partly given in Table 7.1) to illustrate the general\nmethod. It is a classical benchmark for test generation methods. Its specification is to classify sets of\nthree segment lengths into four categories: scalene, isosceles, equilateral, and not a triangle, according\nto whether a given kind of triangle can be formed with these dimensions, or no triangle at all.\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.9**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n1 Part of Chapter 7.1 is from Reference [6]\n2 Part of Chapter 7.2 is from Reference [6]\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe use this benchmark to explain the ability of data mining process for localizing faults. We do so by\nintroducing faults in the program in order to form slight variants, called mutants, and by testing them\nthrough a test suite [9]. The data mining process starts with the output of the tests, i.e., execution traces\nand pass/fail verdicts. The mutants can be found on the web3, and we use them to illustrate the general\nlocalization method.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTable 7.2 presents the eight mutants of the Trityp program. The first mutant is used to explain in detail\nthe  method.  For  mutant  1,  one  fault  has  been  introduced  in  Line  84.  The  condition  (trityp  ==  2)  is\nreplaced by (trityp == 3). That fault causes a failure in two cases:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.3**\nTable 7.1.

Indeed, if the condition (i+k>j) holds, trityp is assigned to 2. However, (i+k>j)\ndoes not always imply (j+k>i), which is the real condition to test when trityp is equal to 3. Therefore,\ntrityp is assigned to 2, whereas 4 is expected.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe  faults  of  mutants  2,  3,  6,  and  8  are  on  assignments.

Source  du  renvoi  introuvable.Erreur !  Source  du  renvoi\nintrouvable.) and association rules (AR, [[3]]) are two well-known methods for symbolic data mining.\nIn their original inception, they both consider data in the form of an object-attribute table. In the FCA\nworld, the table is called a formal context. In the AR world, objects are called transactions and attributes\nare called items, so that a line represents the items present in a given transaction. This comes from one\nof the first applications of AR, namely the basket analysis of retail sales. We will use both vocabularies\ninterchangeably according to context.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDefinition 1 (Formal context and transactions). A formal context, K, is a triple (O, A, d), where O is a\nset of objects, A is a set of attributes, and d is a relation in O × A. We write (o,a)∈ d or oda equivalently.\nIn the AR world, A is called a set of items, or itemset, and each {i∈A | odi} is the oth transaction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor visualization, we will consider objects as labeling lines and attributes as labeling columns of a table.\nA cross sign at the intersection of line o and column a indicates that object o has attribute a.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTable 7.3 is an example of context. The objects are the planets of the solar system, and the attributes are\ndiscretized properties of these planets: size, distance to the sun, and presence of moons. One can observe\nthat all planets without moons are small, but all planets with moons except two are far from the sun. The\ndifficulty is making similar observations in large data sets.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBoth  methods  try  to  answer  questions  such  has  “which  attributes  entail  these  attributes?”  or  “which\nattributes  are  entailed  by  these  attributes?”.  The  main  difference  between  FCA  and  AR  is  that  FCA\nanswers these questions to the letter, i.e., the mere exception to a candidate rule kills the rule, though\nassociation rules are accompanied by statistical indicators. In short, association rules can be almost true.\nAs  a  consequence,  rare  events  as  well  as  frequent  events  are  represented  in  FCA,  whereas  in  AR,\nfrequent events are distinguished.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.4**r== 0.3**\nTable 7.3.

Given  a  formal  context,  the  set  of  all  its  partially\nordered formal concepts forms a lattice called a concept lattice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nGiven a concept lattice, the original formal context can be reconstructed. Figure 7.1 shows the concept\nlattice  deduced  from  the  solar  system  context.  It  is  an  example  of  the  standard  representation  of  a\nconcept lattice. In this representation, concepts are drawn as colored circles with an optional inner label\nthat  serves  as  a  concept  identifier,  and  0,  1,  or  2  outer  labels  in  square  boxes.  Lines  represent  non-\ntransitive containment; therefore, the standard representation displays a Hasse diagram of the lattice\n[26]. The figure is oriented such that higher concepts (higher in the diagram) contain lower concepts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe upper outer label of a concept (such as large for concept G), when present, represents the attributes\nthat are new to this concept intent compared with higher concepts; we call it an attribute label. It can be\nproven that if A is the attribute label of concept c, then A is the smallest set of attributes such that c =\nconcept(A). Symmetrically, the lower outer label of a concept (such as Jupiter, Saturn for concept G),\nwhen present, represents the objects that are new to this concept extent compared with lower concepts;\nwe call it an object label. It can be proven that if O is the object label of concept c, then O is the smallest\nset of objects such that c = concept(O). As a consequence, the intent of a concept is the set of all attribute\nlabels of this concept and higher concepts, and the extent of a concept is the set of all object labels of\nthis concept and lower concepts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor  example,  the  extent  of  concept  A  is  {Jupiter,  Saturn,  Uranus,  Neptune},  and  its  intent  is  {far\nfromsun, withmoons}. In other words, an attribute labels the highest concept to which intent it belongs,\nand an object labels the lowest concept to which extent it belongs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIt has been proven [12] that such a labeling where all attributes and objects are used exactly once is\nalways possible. As a consequence, some formal concepts can be named by an attribute and/or an object;\nfor example, concept G can be called either concept large, Jupiter, or Saturn, but others like concept D\nhave no such names. They are merely unions or intersections of other concepts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn  the  standard  representation  of  concept  lattice,  “a1  entails  a2”  reads  as  an  upward  path  from\nconcept(a1) to concept(a2). Attributes that do not entail each other label incomparable concepts, such as\nattributes small and with moons. Note that there is no purely graphical way to detect that “a1 nearly\nentails a2”.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe  bottom  concept,  ⊥,  has  all  attributes  and  usually  zero  objects,  unless  some  objects  have  all\nattributes.  The  top  concept,\n,  has  all  objects  and  usually  zero  attributes,  unless  some  attributes  are\nshared by all objects.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe  worst-case  time  complexity  of  the  construction  of  a  concept  lattice  is  exponential,  but  we  have\nshown that if the size of the problem can only grow with the number of objects, i.e., the number of\nattributes per object is bounded, then the complexity is linear [11]. Moreover, though the mainstream\ninterpretation of FCA is to compute the concept lattice at once and use it as a means for presenting\ngraphically the structure of a data set, we have shown [11][21] that the concept lattice can be built and\nexplored gradually and efficiently.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFCA is a crisp methodology that is sensitive to every detail of the data set.

For example, the support of near\nsun with moon is 2. Normalized support measures its prevalence as a value in [0, 1], i.e., as a probability\nof occurrence. For example, the normalized support of near sun with moon is 2/8 = 0.25. It can be read\nas the probability of observing the rule in a random transaction of the context. It would seem that the\ngreater the support, the better it is, but very often one must be satisfied with a very small support. This\nis because in large contexts, with many transactions and items, any given co-occurrence of several items\nis a rare event. Efficient algorithms exist for calculating all ARs with minimal support [2][4][24][28].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nConfidence measures the “truthness” of an association rule as the ratio of the prevalence of its premise\nand conclusion together on the prevalence of its premise alone. Its value is in [0, 1], and for a given\npremise, bigger is better; in other words, it is better to have fewer exceptions to the rule considered as a\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.9**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n5 Where . is the cardinal of a set; how many elements it contains.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlogical implication. For example, the confidence of near sun with moon is 2/4 = 0.5. This can be read\nas the conditional probability of observing the conclusion knowing that the premise holds. However,\nthere is no way to tell whether a confidence value is good in itself. In other words, there is no absolute\nthreshold above which a confidence value is good.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLift also measures “truthness” of an association rule, but instead as the increase of the probability of\nobserving  the  conclusion  when  the  premise  holds  w.r.t.  when  it  does  not  hold.  In  other  words,  it\nmeasures how the premise of a rule increases the chance of observing the conclusion. A lift value of 1\nindicates  that  the  premise  and  conclusion  are  independent.  A  lower  value  indicates  that  the  premise\nrepels the conclusion, and a higher value indicates that the premise attracts the conclusion. For example,\nthe lift of near sun with moon is 0.5/0.75, which shows that the attribute near sun repels the attribute\nwith moon; to be near the sun diminishes the probability of having a moon. The rule near sun without\nmoon has a support value of 0.25, confidence value of 0.5, and lift value of 0.5/0.25, which indicates an\nattraction; to be near the sun augments the probability of not having a moon. The two rules have identical\nsupports and confidences but opposite lifts. In the sequel, we will use support as an indicator of the\nprevalence of a rule and lift as an indicator of its “truthness”.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe consider a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Each test case\nyields a transaction in the AR sense, in which attributes correspond to properties observed during the\nexecution of the test case. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case (again, see\nfuture works for variants on this). Thus, the set of all test cases yields a set of transactions that form a\nformal context, which we call a trace context. The main idea of the data mining approach is to look for\na formal explanation of the failures.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFormally, we are looking for association rules following pattern P → FAIL. We call these rules failure\nrules. A failure rule proposes an explanation to a failure, and this explanation can be evaluated according\nto its support and lift. Note that failure rules have a variable premise P and a constant conclusion FAIL.\nThis slightly simplifies the management of rules. For instance, relevance indicators can be specialized\nas follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.7**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n(\nextent P\nextent P\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.8**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n{\n{\nÈ\n(\nextent P\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.7**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.6**r== 0.4**\n)\n}\nFAIL\n}\nFAIL\n)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.7**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.5**\n(\nextent P\nÈ\n(\nextent P\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.7**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\n(\nextent\nÆ\n´\n)\n(\n}\n{\nextent FAIL\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nObserve that extent(Ø) and extent({FAIL}) are constant for a given test suite.

Since the order of the attributes in a formal context does not matter,\nthis forms an abstraction of a standard trace (see a fragment of such a trace context in Table 7.4). Thus,\nexplanations  for  failures  will  consist  of  line  numbers,  lines  that  increase  the  risk  of  failure  when\nexecuted. Had other trace observations been used, the explanations would have been different. For faults\nthat materialize in faulty instructions, it is expected that they will show up as explanations to failed test\ncases. For other faults that materialize in missing instructions, they will still be visible in actual lines\nthat would have been correct if the missing lines where present. For instance, a missing initialization\nwill be seen as the faulty consultation of a non-initialized variable. It is up to a competent debugger to\nconclude from faulty consultations that an initialization is missing.

For\ninstance, if the program has a mandatory initialization part, which always executes a set of lines I, rule\nI→FAIL is a failure rule with maximal support, but it is also less informative. On the contrary, if all\nfailures are caused by executing a set of lines FÉ I, rule9 F\\I→FAIL will have the same support as F\n→FAIL, but will be the most informative. In summary, maximizing support is good, but it is not the\ndefinitive criteria for selecting informative rules.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAnother idea is to use the lift indicator instead of support. However, lift does not grow monotonically\nwith premise inclusion. Therefore, finding rules with a minimal lift cannot be done more efficiently than\nby enumerating all rules and then filtering them.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.4**\nTable 7.5.

The most specific explanations (i.e., the largest premises)\nare at the bottom of the lattice. On the contrary, the least specific failure rules are near the top. For\ninstance,  the  line  numbers  of  a  prelude  sequence  executed  by  every  test  case  will  label  the  topmost\nconcepts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe explanations with the smallest support are at the bottom of the lattice.

The trace mining process [6].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSupport increases when going upstream, from bottom to top. We call this the global monotony of support\nordering. This is a theorem [[5]].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nConcepts form clusters of comparable concepts with the same support. For example, concepts 2, 4, and\n7 in Figure 7.2 form a cluster of rules with support 60. We call them support clusters. This means that\nexplanations of increasing size represent the same group of failures.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn a support cluster, a unique concept has the largest extent. We call it the head concept of the support\ncluster.  It  corresponds  to  the  explanation  with  the  highest  lift  value  in  the  support  cluster.  More\ngenerally,  lift  decreases  when  going  bottom-up  in  a  support  cluster.  We  call  this  behavior  the  local\nmonotony of lift ordering, and it is also a theorem [[5]].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIt is useless to investigate explanations other than the head concepts. This can be done by a bottom-up\nexploration of the failure lattice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn the lattice of Figure 7.2, only concepts 2 (head of support cluster with value 60), 3 (head of support\ncluster with value 52), and 5 (head of support cluster with value 112) need be presented to the debugging\noracle. Concept 5 has Line 84 in its attribute label, which is the location of the fault in this mutant. The\nlocal monotony of lift ordering shows that the lift indicator can be used as a metric, but only inside\nsupport clusters.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe  process  that  we  have  presented  is  dominated  by  the  choice  of  a  minimal  value  for  the  support\nindicator. Recall that the support of an explanation is simply the number of simultaneous realizations of\nits items in the failure context, and the normalized support is the ratio of this number to the total number\nof  realizations.  In  this  application  of  ARs,  it  is  more  meaningful  to  use  the  non-normalized  variant\nbecause it directly represents the number of failed test cases covered by an explanation. What is a good\nvalue  for  the  minimal  support?  First,  it  cannot  be  larger  than  the  number  of  failed  test  cases  (=\nextent(FAIL)); otherwise, no P → FAIL rule will show up. Second, it cannot be less than 1. The choice\nof between 1 and extent(FAIL) depends on the nature of the fault, but in any case, experiments show\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthat acceptable minimum support is quite low (a few percent of the total number of test cases). A high\nminimal support will filter out all faults that are the causes of less failures than this threshold. Very\nsingular faults will require a very small support, eventually 1, to be visible in the failure lattice. This\nsuggests starting with a high support to localize the most visible faults, and then decreasing the support\nto localize less frequently executed faults. The minimal support acts as a resolution cursor. A coarse\nresolution will show the largest features at a low cost, and a finer resolution will be required to zoom in\non smaller features at a higher cost.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe have insisted on using lift instead of confidence as a “truthness” indicator, because it lends itself\nmore easily to an interpretation (recall Definition 4 and subsequent comments). However, in the case of\nfailure rules, the conclusion is fixed (= FAIL), and both indicators increase and decrease in the same\nway when the premise changes (recall Lemma 3). The only difference is that the lift indicator yields a\nnormalized value (1 is independence, bellow 1 is repulsion, and over 1 is attraction). What is the effect\nof a minimum lift value? Firstly, if it is chosen to be larger than or equal to 1, it will eliminate all failure\nrules that show a repulsion between the premise and conclusion. Secondly, if it is chosen to be strictly\ngreater than 1, it will eliminate failure rules that have a lower lift, thus compressing the representation\nof support clusters and eventually eliminating some support clusters. Thus, the minimal lift also acts as\na zoom.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.3**\nFigure 7.4.

The four Venn diagrams of two-fault dependency [6].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis  suggests  a  global  debugging  process  in  which  the  results  of  an  increasingly  large  test  suite  are\nexamined with increasing acuity (see\nFigure 7.4). Given a test suite, an inner loop computes failure rules, i.e., explanations with decreasing\nsupport, from a fraction of extent(FAIL) to 1, and builds the corresponding failure lattice. In the outer\nloop,  test  cases  are  added  progressively  to  cope  with  added  functionality  (such  as  test-driven\ndevelopment) or new failure reports. Thus, the global debugging process zooms in on the failed test\ncases to find explanations for more and more specific failures.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 12.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis section extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situation.\nFrom the debugging process point of view, there is nothing special about multiple faults. Some software\nengineering  life  cycles  like  test-driven  development  tend  to  limit  the  number  of  faults  observed\nsimultaneously, but one can never assume a priori that there is a single fault. Thus, we assume there are\none or several faults.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn the multiple fault case, each failure trace accounts for one or several faults. Conversely, faulty lines\nare suspected in one or several failure traces. Thus, the inner loop of the global debugging process cannot\nstop because a fault is found. The process must go on until all failures are explained. How can this be\ndone without exploring the entire failure lattice?\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nConsider any pair of two faults F1 and F2, and F ail F1 and F ail F2 are the sets of failed test cases that\ndetect F1 and F2, respectively. We identify four types of possible dependencies between the two faults.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n, we say that they are mutually strongly\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 12.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.3**\nwe say F1 is strongly dependent (SD) from F2 (and vice versa).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.4**\n, we say that they are loosely dependent (LD).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.3**\n, we say that they are independent (ID).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNote that this classification, is not intrinsic to a pair of faults; it depends on the test suite. However, it\ndoes not depend arbitrarily from the test suite.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLemma 5 (How failure dependencies depend on growing test suites) Assume that the test suite can\nonly grow, then an ID or SD pair can only become LD, and an MSD pair can only become SD or LD.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNote  also  that  this  knowledge,  with  several  faults  and  the  dependencies  between  them,  is  what  the\ndebugging  person  is  looking  for,  whereas  the  trace  context  only  gives  hints  at  this  knowledge.  The\nquestion is: how does it give hints at this knowledge?\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nThe main idea is to distinguish special concepts in the failure lattice that we call failure concepts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDefinition 8 (Failure concept). A failure concept is a maximally specific concept of the failure lattice\nwhose intent (a set of lines) is contained in a failed execution.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nRecall that the failure rules are an abstraction of the failed execution. For instance, choosing minimal\nsupport and lift values eliminates lines that are seldom executed or that do not attract failure. Thus, the\nfailure lattice describes exactly the selected failure rules but only approximately the failed executions.\nThat is why it is interesting; it compresses information, though with loss. The failure concepts in the\nfailure lattice are the concepts that best approximate failed executions. All other concepts contain less\nprecise information. For the same reasons, there are much fewer failure concepts than failed executions;\neach failure concept accounts for a group of failures that detects some fault.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe main use for failure concepts is to give a criterion for stopping the exploration of the failure lattice.\nIn a few words,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\n•  The bottom-up exploration of the failure lattice goes from support clusters to support clusters\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nas above;\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\n•  The  line  labels  of  the  traversed  concepts  are  accumulated  in  a  fault  context  sent  to  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\ncompetent debugger;\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\n•  Any time a competent debugger finds a hint at an actual fault, all the failure concepts under the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.4**\nconcept that gave the hint are deemed explained;\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.4**\n•  The process continues until all failure concepts are explained.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe fault context is the part of the program that the debugging person is supposed to check.

If two faults are ID, their lines can never occur in\nthe  same  failed  trace,  and  then  no  rule  contains  the  two  faults  and  no  concept  in  the  failure  lattice\ncontains the two faults. Thus, the two faults will label failure concepts in two different support clusters\nthat have no subconcepts in common (for an example, see Figure 7.6).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nConcretely, when exploring the failure lattice bottom-up, finding a fault in the label of a concept explains\nboth the concept and the concepts underneath, but the faults in the other upper branches remain to be\nexplained.

If two faults are SD, say F1 depends on F2, a\nfailure concept whose intent contains LineF1 will appear as a subconcept of a failure concept whose\nconcept contains LineF2 in a different support cluster (for an example, see Figure 7.7).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTherefore, fault F1 will be found before F2, but the debugging process must continue because there is a\nfailure concept above.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLemma 9 (MSD faults with respect to failure concepts). Finally, if two faults are MSD, they cannot be\ndistinguished  by  failed  executions,  and  their  failure  concepts  belong  to  the  same  support  cluster.\nHowever, they can sometimes be distinguished by passed executions (such as one having more passed\nexecutions than the other), and this can be seen in the failure lattice through the lift value.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAll this can be formalized in an algorithm that searches for multiple faults in an efficient traversal of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfailure lattice (see\nAlgorithm 7.1). The failure lattice is traversed bottom-up, starting with the failure concepts (step 1). At\nthe end of the failure lattice traversal, CfailuretoExplain, the set of failure concepts not explained by a fault\n(step 2) must be empty, or all concepts must be already explored (step 3). When a concept, c (step 4), is\nchosen among the concepts to explore, CtoExplore, the events that label the concept are explored. Note that\nthe selection of that concept is not determinist. If no fault is located, then the upper neighbours of c are\nadded  to  the  set  of  concepts  to  explore  (step  7).  If,  thanks  to  the  new  clues,  the  debugging  oracle\nunderstands mistakes and locates one or several faults, then all subconcepts of c and all concepts that\nare in the same support cluster are “explained”.  Those concepts do not have to be explored again (step\n10).  This  means  that  the  failure  concepts  that  are  subconcepts  of  c  are  explained  (step  11).  The\nexploration goes on until all failed executions in the failure lattice are explained by at least one fault, or\nall concepts have been explored.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFigure 7.7.

That concept is labeled by lines 81 and 84. By exploring those lines (new\nclues) in addition with the fault context, i.e., lines that have already been explored: 87, 90, 101, and 85,\nthe competent debugging oracle locates fault 1 at line 84. The fault is the substitution of the test of trityp\n= 2 by trityp = 3. Concepts 12 and 9 exhibit two concrete realizations (failures) of the fault at line 84\n(Concept 7). Concepts 7, 12, and 9 are tagged as explained. The set of failure concepts to explain is\nempty; thus, the exploration stops. All four faults (for failures above support and lift threshold) are found\nafter the debugging oracle has inspected nine lines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe contexts and lattices introduced in the previous sections allow programmers to see all the differences\nbetween  execution  traces  as  well  as  all  the  differences  between  association  rules.  There  exist  other\nmethods that compute differences between execution traces. We first show that the information about\ntrace differences provided by the failure context (and the corresponding lattice) is already more relevant\nthan the information provided by four other methods proposed by Renieris and Reiss [25] and Cleve\nand Zeller [7]. Then, we show that explicitly using association rules with several lines in the premise\nalleviates some limitations of Jones et al.’s method [15]. Finally, we show that reasoning on the partial\nordering given by the proposed failure lattice is more relevant than reasoning on total order rankings\n[8][18][20][24][32].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe trace context contains the whole information about execution traces. In particular, the associated\nlattice, the trace lattice, allows programmers to see all differences between traces in one pass.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThere exist several fault localization methods based on the differences between execution traces. They\nall assume a single failed execution and several passed executions. We rephrase them in terms of search\nin a lattice to highlight their advantages, their hidden hypothesis, and limitations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe union model, proposed by Renieris and Reiss [25], aims at finding features that are specific to the\nfailed execution. The method is based on trace differences between the failed execution f and a set of\npassed executions S : f -∪s∈Ss. The underlying intuition is that the failure is caused by lines that are\nexecuted  only  in  the  failed  execution.  Formalized  in  FCA  terms,  the  concepts  of  interest  are  the\nsubconcepts  whose  label  contains  FAIL,  and  the  computed  information  is  the  lines  contained  in  the\nlabels of the subconcepts. The trace lattice presented in the figure is slightly different from the lattice\nthat  would  be  computed  for  the  union  model,  because  it  represents  more  than  one  failed  execution.\nNevertheless,  the  union  model  often  computes  empty  information,  namely  each  time  the  faulty  line\nbelongs to failed and passed execution traces. For example, a fault in a condition has a very slight chance\nto be localized. The approach we presented is based on the same intuition. However, the lattices that we\npropose do not lose information and help navigate in order to localize the faults, even when the faulty\nline belongs to both failed and passed execution traces.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe union model helps localize a bug when executing the faulty statement always implies an error, such\nas the bad assignment of a variable that is the result of the program. In that case, the lattice also helps,\nand the faulty statement labels the same concept as FAIL.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe intersection model [25] is the complementary of the previous model. It computes the features whose\nabsence is discriminant of the failed execution: ∩s∈Ss - f. Replacing FAIL with PASS in the above\ndiscussion is relevant to discussing the intersection model and leads to the same conclusions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 18.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe nearest neighbor approach [25] computes a distance metric between the failed execution trace and\na set of passed execution traces. The computed trace difference involves the failed execution trace, f ,\nand only one passed execution trace, the nearest one, p : f - p. The difference is meant to be the part of\nthe code to explore. The approach can be formalized in FCA. Given a concept Cf whose intent contains\nFAIL, the nearest neighbor method searches for a concept Cp whose intent contains PASS, such that the\nintent of Cp shares as many lines as possible with the intent of Cf.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 18.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe rightmost concept fails, whereas the leftmost one passes. As for the previous methods, it is a good\napproach when the execution of the faulty statement always involves an error. However, when the faulty\nstatement can lead to both a passed and a failed execution, the nearest neighbor method is not sufficient.\nIn addition, we remark that there are possibly many concepts of interest, namely all the nearest neighbors\nof the concept that is labeled by FAIL. With a lattice, that kind of behavior can be observed directly.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 18.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNote that in the trace lattice, the executions that execute the same lines are clustered in the label of a\nsingle concept. Executions that are nearby share a large part of their executed lines and label concepts\nthat are neighbors in the lattice. There is therefore no reason to restrict the comparison to a single pass\nexecution. Furthermore, all the nearest neighbors are naturally in the lattice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 18.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDelta debugging, proposed by Zeller et al. [8], reasons on the values of variables during executions\nrather than on executed lines. The trace spectrum, and therefore the trace context, contains different\ntypes of attributes. Note that the presented approach does not depend on the type of attributes and would\napply more to spectra containing other attributes than executed lines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 18.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDelta  debugging  computes  the  differences  between  the  failed  execution  trace  and  a  single  passed\nexecution trace in a memory graph. By injecting the values of variables of the failed execution into\nvariables of the passed execution, the method tries to determine a small set of suspicious variables. One\nof the purposes of the method is to find a passed execution relatively similar to the failed execution. It\nhas the same drawbacks as the nearest neighbor method.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 18.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTarantula\nJones et al. [15] computed association rules with only one line in the premise. Denmat et al. [10] showed\nthe limitations of this method through three implicit hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that a failure has\na single faulty statement origin. The second hypothesis is that lines are independent. The third hypothesis\nis that executing the faulty statement often causes a failure. That last hypothesis is a common assumption\nof fault localization methods, including the presented method. Indeed, when the fault is executed in both\npassed and failed executions (such as in a prelude), it cannot be found so easily using these hypotheses.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn addition, Denmat et al. demonstrated that the ad hoc indicator, which was used by Jones et al., is\nequivalent to the lift indicator.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBy using association rules with more expressive premises than in Jones et al.’s method (namely with\nseveral lines), the limitations mentioned above are alleviated. Firstly, the fault need not be a single line\nbut can contain several lines together. Secondly, the dependency between lines is taken into account.\nIndeed, dependent lines are clustered or ordered together.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe part of the trace context that is important to search in order to localize a fault is the set of concepts\nthat are related to the concept labeled by FAIL; i.e., those that have a non-empty intersection with the\nconcept labeled by FAIL. Computing association rules with FAIL as a conclusion compute exactly those\nconcepts, modulo the minsup and minlift filtering. In other words, the focus is done on the part of the\nlattice related to the concept labeled by FAIL.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nJones et al.’s method presents the result of the analysis to the user as a coloring of the source code. A\nred-green gradient indicates the correlation with failure. Lines that are highly correlated with failure are\ncolored  in  red,  whereas  lines  that  are  not  highly  correlated  are  colored  in  green.  Red  lines  typically\nrepresent  more  than  10%  of  the  lines  of  the  program,  without  identified  links  between  them.  Other\nstatistical methods [8][18][19][32] also try to rank lines in a total ordering. It can be seen as ordering\nthe concepts of the failure lattice by the lift value of the rule in their label. However, we have shown in\nSection 1.3 that the monotonicity of lift is only relevant locally to a support cluster.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor example, on the failure lattice of Figure 7.2, the obtained ranking would be: line 85, line 66, line 68,\nline 84.  No link would be established between the execution of line 85 and line 68, for example.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe user who must localize a fault in a program has background knowledge about the program and can\nuse  it  to  explore  the  failure  lattice.  Reading  the  lattice  gives  context  about  the  fault  and  not  just  a\nsequence of independent lines to be examined, and it reduces the number of lines to be examined at each\nstep (concept) by structuring them.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe have compared the failure lattice with existing single fault localization methods. In this section, we\ncompare the presented navigation in the failure lattice with the strategies of the other methods to detect\nseveral faults.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe presented approach involves algorithmic debugging [27]. The difference lies in the traversed data\nstructure. While Shapiro’s algorithm helps traverse a proof tree, the presented algorithm helps traverse\nthe failure lattice, starting from the most suspicious places.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor multiple faults, Jiang et al. [14] criticized the ranking of statistical methods. They proposed a method\nbased on traces whose events are predicates. The predicates are clustered, and the path in the control\nflow  graph  associated  to  each  cluster  is  computed.  In  the  failure  lattice,  events  are  also  clustered  in\nconcepts. The relations between concepts give information about the path in the control flow graph and\nhighlight some parts of that path as relevant to debug without computing the control flow graph.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 19.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nZheng  et  al.  [32]  proposed  a  method  based  on  bi-clustering  in  order  to  group  failed  executions  and\nidentify one feature (bug predictor) that characterizes each cluster. They proposed to look at one bug\npredictor at a time. Several bug predictors can be in relation with the same fault, but no link is drawn\nbetween  them.

Eric Wong3*   1IRISA/INSA Rennes 22IRISA/Universite de Rennes 3Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA   Software engineering processes generate a large amount of data, and several authors have advocated for the use of data mining methods to conduct fault localization. Many data mining methods with different merits exist, but the very first step is often to simply consider as data what was previously considered a mere by-product of a process. One of the first historical examples of uncovering new knowledge from pre-existing data was Florence Nightingale’s (1820-1910) demonstration that soldiers died more often from bad sanitary conditions in military hospitals than from battle wounds. For her demonstration, she gathered previously ignored data and presented it in revealing graphics. This example demonstrates that data mining is itself a process with important questions, from the selection and gathering of data to the presentation  of  the  results.  In  the  fault  localization  context,  the  following  questions  emerge:  which existing data can be leveraged to improve the localization? Which presentation of the results is best suited  for  the  debugging  process?  In  this  chapter,  we  will  illustrate  the  basic  concepts  of  fault localization using a data mining technique and present three approaches to locate the faulty statements of a program. We will also address how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components.   As software engineering data are symbolic by nature, in this chapter, we will present fault localization using symbolic methods. Symbolic methods tend to lend themselves naturally to give explanations, and this is exactly what we are looking for in fault localization. Indeed, we prefer a system with the capacity of saying “the failure has to do with the initialization of variable x” to a system limited to saying “the fault is in these million lines with probability 0.527”. Therefore, we will illustrate how to use two data mining techniques: association rules and formal concept analysis in fault localization.   Formal concept analysis and association rules deal with collections of objects and their features. The former extracts contextual truth, such as “in this assembly, all white-haired female wear glasses”, while the latter extracts relativized truth, such as “in this assembly, carrying a briefcase increases the chance of wearing a tie”. In a fault localization context, the former could say that “all failed tests call method m”, and the latter could discover that “most failed tests call method m, which is very seldom called in passed tests”.   Throughout this chapter, we use the Trityp program (partly given in Table 7.1) to illustrate the general method. It is a classical benchmark for test generation methods. Its specification is to classify sets of three segment lengths into four categories: scalene, isosceles, equilateral, and not a triangle, according to whether a given kind of triangle can be formed with these dimensions, or no triangle at all.   We use this benchmark to explain the ability of data mining process for localizing faults. We do so by introducing faults in the program in order to form slight variants, called mutants, and by testing them through a test suite [9]. The data mining process starts with the output of the tests, i.e., execution traces and pass/fail verdicts. The mutants can be found on the web3, and we use them to illustrate the general localization method.   Table 7.2 presents the eight mutants of the Trityp program. The first mutant is used to explain in detail the  method.  For  mutant  1,  one  fault  has  been  introduced  in  Line  84.  The  condition  (trityp  ==  2)  is replaced by (trityp == 3). That fault causes a failure in two cases:   Table 7.1. Source code of the Trityp program [6].

(2) The second case is when trityp is equal to 3; the execution should go to Line 87, but due to the fault, it goes to Line 84. Indeed, if the condition (i+k>j) holds, trityp is assigned to 2. However, (i+k>j) does not always imply (j+k>i), which is the real condition to test when trityp is equal to 3. Therefore, trityp is assigned to 2, whereas 4 is expected.   The  faults  of  mutants  2,  3,  6,  and  8  are  on  assignments.  The  faults  of  mutants  4,  5,  and  7  are  on conditions. We will present more details about multiple fault situations in Chapter 8.5. In this case, we simply combine several mutations to form new mutants.   Formal  concept  analysis  (FCA,  [12]  Erreur !  Source  du  renvoi  introuvable.Erreur !  Source  du  renvoi introuvable.) and association rules (AR, [[3]]) are two well-known methods for symbolic data mining. In their original inception, they both consider data in the form of an object-attribute table. In the FCA world, the table is called a formal context. In the AR world, objects are called transactions and attributes are called items, so that a line represents the items present in a given transaction. This comes from one of the first applications of AR, namely the basket analysis of retail sales. We will use both vocabularies interchangeably according to context.   Definition 1 (Formal context and transactions). A formal context, K, is a triple (O, A, d), where O is a set of objects, A is a set of attributes, and d is a relation in O × A. We write (o,a)∈ d or oda equivalently. In the AR world, A is called a set of items, or itemset, and each {i∈A | odi} is the oth transaction.   For visualization, we will consider objects as labeling lines and attributes as labeling columns of a table. A cross sign at the intersection of line o and column a indicates that object o has attribute a.   Table 7.3 is an example of context. The objects are the planets of the solar system, and the attributes are discretized properties of these planets: size, distance to the sun, and presence of moons. One can observe that all planets without moons are small, but all planets with moons except two are far from the sun. The difficulty is making similar observations in large data sets.   Both  methods  try  to  answer  questions  such  has  “which  attributes  entail  these  attributes?”  or  “which attributes  are  entailed  by  these  attributes?”.  The  main  difference  between  FCA  and  AR  is  that  FCA answers these questions to the letter, i.e., the mere exception to a candidate rule kills the rule, though association rules are accompanied by statistical indicators. In short, association rules can be almost true. As  a  consequence,  rare  events  as  well  as  frequent  events  are  represented  in  FCA,  whereas  in  AR, frequent events are distinguished.   Table 7.3. The Solar system context [6].   small  medium   largen   far  with  Without   FCA searches for sets of objects and sets of attributes with equal significance, like Mercury, Venus, and without moons, and then orders the significances by their specificity.

We say that   contains   ( forms a formal concept iff   Lemma 1 (Basic FCA results) It is worth remembering the following results:   extent   and  int   extent(intent(extent(A))) = extent(A) and intent(extent(intent(O))) = intent(O). Hence, extent circ intent and intent circ extent are closure operators.   Figure 7.1. Concept lattice of the solar system context (see Table 7.1) [6].   ) O A iff A   (extent)intent(O)), intent(O)) is always a formal concept, and it is written as concept(O). In the same   way, (extent(A), intent(extent(A))) is always a formal concept as well, and it is written as concept(A). All formal concepts can be constructed this way.   Theorem  1  (Fundamental  theorem  of  FCA,  [16]).  Given  a  formal  context,  the  set  of  all  its  partially ordered formal concepts forms a lattice called a concept lattice.   Given a concept lattice, the original formal context can be reconstructed. Figure 7.1 shows the concept lattice  deduced  from  the  solar  system  context.  It  is  an  example  of  the  standard  representation  of  a concept lattice. In this representation, concepts are drawn as colored circles with an optional inner label that  serves  as  a  concept  identifier,  and  0,  1,  or  2  outer  labels  in  square  boxes.  Lines  represent  non- transitive containment; therefore, the standard representation displays a Hasse diagram of the lattice [26]. The figure is oriented such that higher concepts (higher in the diagram) contain lower concepts.   The upper outer label of a concept (such as large for concept G), when present, represents the attributes that are new to this concept intent compared with higher concepts; we call it an attribute label. It can be proven that if A is the attribute label of concept c, then A is the smallest set of attributes such that c = concept(A). Symmetrically, the lower outer label of a concept (such as Jupiter, Saturn for concept G), when present, represents the objects that are new to this concept extent compared with lower concepts; we call it an object label. It can be proven that if O is the object label of concept c, then O is the smallest set of objects such that c = concept(O). As a consequence, the intent of a concept is the set of all attribute labels of this concept and higher concepts, and the extent of a concept is the set of all object labels of this concept and lower concepts.   For  example,  the  extent  of  concept  A  is  {Jupiter,  Saturn,  Uranus,  Neptune},  and  its  intent  is  {far fromsun, withmoons}. In other words, an attribute labels the highest concept to which intent it belongs, and an object labels the lowest concept to which extent it belongs.   It has been proven [12] that such a labeling where all attributes and objects are used exactly once is always possible. As a consequence, some formal concepts can be named by an attribute and/or an object; for example, concept G can be called either concept large, Jupiter, or Saturn, but others like concept D have no such names. They are merely unions or intersections of other concepts.   In  the  standard  representation  of  concept  lattice,  “a1  entails  a2”  reads  as  an  upward  path  from concept(a1) to concept(a2). Attributes that do not entail each other label incomparable concepts, such as attributes small and with moons. Note that there is no purely graphical way to detect that “a1 nearly entails a2”.   The  bottom  concept,  ⊥,  has  all  attributes  and  usually  zero  objects,  unless  some  objects  have  all attributes.  The  top  concept, ,  has  all  objects  and  usually  zero  attributes,  unless  some  attributes  are shared by all objects.   The  worst-case  time  complexity  of  the  construction  of  a  concept  lattice  is  exponential,  but  we  have shown that if the size of the problem can only grow with the number of objects, i.e., the number of attributes per object is bounded, then the complexity is linear [11]. Moreover, though the mainstream interpretation of FCA is to compute the concept lattice at once and use it as a means for presenting graphically the structure of a data set, we have shown [11][21] that the concept lattice can be built and explored gradually and efficiently.   FCA is a crisp methodology that is sensitive to every detail of the data set. Sometimes, one may wish for a method that is more tolerant to exceptions.   Definition 3 (Association rules), Let K be a set of transactions, i.e., a formal context seen as a set of lines seen as itemsets. An association rule is a pair (P, C) of itemsets. It is usually written as P→ C.   The P part is called the premise, and the C part is the conclusion.   Note that any P→C forms an association rule. It does not mean it is a relevant one. Statistical indicators give hints at the relevance of a rule.   , is defined as5   is defined as   ( extent P CÈ   ( extent P C ) extent   ,written con   ,is defined as   ( extent P C ) extent P   , written lift   , is defined as   ( conf P ( Æ ®   ) extent P C extemt È ´ ( ) extent P extent C ´   Support measures the prevalence of an association rule in a data set. For example, the support of near sun with moon is 2. Normalized support measures its prevalence as a value in [0, 1], i.e., as a probability of occurrence. For example, the normalized support of near sun with moon is 2/8 = 0.25. It can be read as the probability of observing the rule in a random transaction of the context. It would seem that the greater the support, the better it is, but very often one must be satisfied with a very small support. This is because in large contexts, with many transactions and items, any given co-occurrence of several items is a rare event. Efficient algorithms exist for calculating all ARs with minimal support [2][4][24][28].   Confidence measures the “truthness” of an association rule as the ratio of the prevalence of its premise and conclusion together on the prevalence of its premise alone. Its value is in [0, 1], and for a given premise, bigger is better; in other words, it is better to have fewer exceptions to the rule considered as a   logical implication. For example, the confidence of near sun with moon is 2/4 = 0.5. This can be read as the conditional probability of observing the conclusion knowing that the premise holds. However, there is no way to tell whether a confidence value is good in itself. In other words, there is no absolute threshold above which a confidence value is good.   Lift also measures “truthness” of an association rule, but instead as the increase of the probability of observing  the  conclusion  when  the  premise  holds  w.r.t.  when  it  does  not  hold.  In  other  words,  it measures how the premise of a rule increases the chance of observing the conclusion. A lift value of 1 indicates  that  the  premise  and  conclusion  are  independent.  A  lower  value  indicates  that  the  premise repels the conclusion, and a higher value indicates that the premise attracts the conclusion. For example, the lift of near sun with moon is 0.5/0.75, which shows that the attribute near sun repels the attribute with moon; to be near the sun diminishes the probability of having a moon. The rule near sun without moon has a support value of 0.25, confidence value of 0.5, and lift value of 0.5/0.25, which indicates an attraction; to be near the sun augments the probability of not having a moon. The two rules have identical supports and confidences but opposite lifts. In the sequel, we will use support as an indicator of the prevalence of a rule and lift as an indicator of its “truthness”.   We consider a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Each test case yields a transaction in the AR sense, in which attributes correspond to properties observed during the execution of the test case. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case (again, see future works for variants on this). Thus, the set of all test cases yields a set of transactions that form a formal context, which we call a trace context. The main idea of the data mining approach is to look for a formal explanation of the failures.   Formally, we are looking for association rules following pattern P → FAIL. We call these rules failure rules. A failure rule proposes an explanation to a failure, and this explanation can be evaluated according to its support and lift. Note that failure rules have a variable premise P and a constant conclusion FAIL. This slightly simplifies the management of rules. For instance, relevance indicators can be specialized as follows:   ( extent P extent P   ( extent P È ( extent P   Observe that extent(Ø) and extent({FAIL}) are constant for a given test suite. Only extent(P) and extent （P∪ {FAIL} depend on the failure rule.   It is interesting to understand the dynamics of these indicators when new test cases are added to the trace context.   Lemma 2 (Dynamics of relevance indicators with respect to test suite). Consider a failure rule P FAIL:   A  new  passed  test  case  that  executes  P  will  leave  its  support  unchanged  (normalized  support  will decrease slightly7), will decrease its confidence, and will decrease its lift slightly if P is not executed by all test cases.   A  new  passed  test  case  that  does  not  execute  P  will  leave  its  support  and  confidence  unchanged (normalized support will decrease slightly) and will increase its lift.   A new failed test case that executes P will increase its support and confidence (normalized support will increase slightly) and will increase its lift slightly if P is not executed by all test cases.   A  new  failed  test  case  that  does  not  execute  P  will  leave  its  support  and  confidence  unchanged (normalized support will decrease slightly), and will decrease its lift.   In summary, support and confidence grow with new failed test cases that execute P, and lift grows with failed test cases that execute P or passed test cases that do not execute P. Failed test cases that execute P increase all the indicators, but passed test cases that do not execute P only increase lift8.   Lemma 3 (Dynamics of relevance indicators with respect to premise). Consider a failure rule P→FAIL and replacing P with P such that P>P:   Support will decrease (except if all test cases fail, which should not persist). One says P→FAIL is more specific than P→FAIL.   Confidence and lift can go either way, but both in the same way because   ) extent ( { } extent FAIL   is a constant.   For the sequel of the description, we assume that the attributes recorded in the trace context are line numbers of executed statements. Since the order of the attributes in a formal context does not matter, this forms an abstraction of a standard trace (see a fragment of such a trace context in Table 7.4). Thus, explanations  for  failures  will  consist  of  line  numbers,  lines  that  increase  the  risk  of  failure  when executed. Had other trace observations been used, the explanations would have been different. For faults that materialize in faulty instructions, it is expected that they will show up as explanations to failed test cases. For other faults that materialize in missing instructions, they will still be visible in actual lines that would have been correct if the missing lines where present. For instance, a missing initialization will be seen as the faulty consultation of a non-initialized variable. It is up to a competent debugger to conclude from faulty consultations that an initialization is missing. Note finally that the relationships   Table 7.4. A trace context [6].   Test case   Executed lines  ×   58  …  105  PASS  FAIL ×   •  Executing a faulty line does not necessarily cause a failure. For example, a fault in a line may not be stressed by a case test (e.g. faulty condition i > 1 instead of the expected i >  0, tested with i equals to 10) or a faulty line that is “corrected” by another one.   •  Absolutely correct lines can apparently cause failure, such as lines of the same basic block [29] as a faulty line (they will have exactly the same distribution as the faulty line) or lines whose preconditions cannot be established by a distant faulty part.   Failure rules are selected according to a minimal support criterion. However, there are too many such rules, and it would be inconvenient to list them all. We have observed in Lemma 3 that more specific rules  have  less  support.  However,  this  does  not  mean  that  less  specific  rules  must  be  preferred.  For instance, if the program has a mandatory initialization part, which always executes a set of lines I, rule I→FAIL is a failure rule with maximal support, but it is also less informative. On the contrary, if all failures are caused by executing a set of lines FÉ I, rule9 F\\I→FAIL will have the same support as F →FAIL, but will be the most informative. In summary, maximizing support is good, but it is not the definitive criteria for selecting informative rules.   Another idea is to use the lift indicator instead of support. However, lift does not grow monotonically with premise inclusion. Therefore, finding rules with a minimal lift cannot be done more efficiently than by enumerating all rules and then filtering them.   Table 7.5. Failure context for mutant 1 of the Trityp program with min   lift = mutant 1 the fault is at line 84, see Table 7.1 ) [6].   and min   Executed lines  ×   Here, we describe how to use FCA to help navigate in the set of explanations.   Definition 6 (The failure lattice). Form a formal context with the premises of failure rules. The rules   identifiers are the objects, and their premises are the attributes (in our example, line numbers) (see an example in Table 7.5). It is called the failure context.   Observe that the failure context is special in that all premises of failure rules are different from each other10. Thus, they are uniquely determined by their premises (or itemsets). Thus, it is not necessary to identify them by objects identifiers.   Apply  FCA  on  this  formal  context  to  form  the  corresponding  concept  lattice. It  is  called  the  failure lattice. Its concepts and labeling display the most specific explanations to groups of failed tests.   Since object identifiers are useless, replace object labels by the support and lift of the unique rule that labels each concept. This forms the failure lattice (see Figure 8.3). The overall trace mining process is summarized in Figure 8.4.   Lemma 4 (Properties of the failure lattice). The most specific explanations (i.e., the largest premises) are at the bottom of the lattice. On the contrary, the least specific failure rules are near the top. For instance,  the  line  numbers  of  a  prelude  sequence  executed  by  every  test  case  will  label  the  topmost concepts.   The explanations with the smallest support are at the bottom of the lattice. For example, line numbers executed only by specific failed test cases will label concepts near the bottom.   Figure 7.2. Failure lattice associated to the failure context of Table 7.5 (for mutant 1, the fault is at line 84) [6]   Figure 7.3. The trace mining process [6].   Support increases when going upstream, from bottom to top. We call this the global monotony of support ordering. This is a theorem [[5]].   Concepts form clusters of comparable concepts with the same support. For example, concepts 2, 4, and 7 in Figure 7.2 form a cluster of rules with support 60. We call them support clusters. This means that explanations of increasing size represent the same group of failures.   In a support cluster, a unique concept has the largest extent. We call it the head concept of the support cluster.  It  corresponds  to  the  explanation  with  the  highest  lift  value  in  the  support  cluster.  More generally,  lift  decreases  when  going  bottom-up  in  a  support  cluster.  We  call  this  behavior  the  local monotony of lift ordering, and it is also a theorem [[5]].   It is useless to investigate explanations other than the head concepts. This can be done by a bottom-up exploration of the failure lattice.   In the lattice of Figure 7.2, only concepts 2 (head of support cluster with value 60), 3 (head of support cluster with value 52), and 5 (head of support cluster with value 112) need be presented to the debugging oracle. Concept 5 has Line 84 in its attribute label, which is the location of the fault in this mutant. The local monotony of lift ordering shows that the lift indicator can be used as a metric, but only inside support clusters.   The  process  that  we  have  presented  is  dominated  by  the  choice  of  a  minimal  value  for  the  support indicator. Recall that the support of an explanation is simply the number of simultaneous realizations of its items in the failure context, and the normalized support is the ratio of this number to the total number of  realizations.  In  this  application  of  ARs,  it  is  more  meaningful  to  use  the  non-normalized  variant because it directly represents the number of failed test cases covered by an explanation. What is a good value  for  the  minimal  support?  First,  it  cannot  be  larger  than  the  number  of  failed  test  cases  (= extent(FAIL)); otherwise, no P → FAIL rule will show up. Second, it cannot be less than 1. The choice of between 1 and extent(FAIL) depends on the nature of the fault, but in any case, experiments show   that acceptable minimum support is quite low (a few percent of the total number of test cases). A high minimal support will filter out all faults that are the causes of less failures than this threshold. Very singular faults will require a very small support, eventually 1, to be visible in the failure lattice. This suggests starting with a high support to localize the most visible faults, and then decreasing the support to localize less frequently executed faults. The minimal support acts as a resolution cursor. A coarse resolution will show the largest features at a low cost, and a finer resolution will be required to zoom in on smaller features at a higher cost.   We have insisted on using lift instead of confidence as a “truthness” indicator, because it lends itself more easily to an interpretation (recall Definition 4 and subsequent comments). However, in the case of failure rules, the conclusion is fixed (= FAIL), and both indicators increase and decrease in the same way when the premise changes (recall Lemma 3). The only difference is that the lift indicator yields a normalized value (1 is independence, bellow 1 is repulsion, and over 1 is attraction). What is the effect of a minimum lift value? Firstly, if it is chosen to be larger than or equal to 1, it will eliminate all failure rules that show a repulsion between the premise and conclusion. Secondly, if it is chosen to be strictly greater than 1, it will eliminate failure rules that have a lower lift, thus compressing the representation of support clusters and eventually eliminating some support clusters. Thus, the minimal lift also acts as a zoom.   Figure 7.4. The global debugging process [6].   Figure 7.5. The four Venn diagrams of two-fault dependency [6].   This  suggests  a  global  debugging  process  in  which  the  results  of  an  increasingly  large  test  suite  are examined with increasing acuity (see Figure 7.4). Given a test suite, an inner loop computes failure rules, i.e., explanations with decreasing support, from a fraction of extent(FAIL) to 1, and builds the corresponding failure lattice. In the outer loop,  test  cases  are  added  progressively  to  cope  with  added  functionality  (such  as  test-driven development) or new failure reports. Thus, the global debugging process zooms in on the failed test cases to find explanations for more and more specific failures.   This section extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situation. From the debugging process point of view, there is nothing special about multiple faults. Some software engineering  life  cycles  like  test-driven  development  tend  to  limit  the  number  of  faults  observed simultaneously, but one can never assume a priori that there is a single fault. Thus, we assume there are one or several faults.   In the multiple fault case, each failure trace accounts for one or several faults. Conversely, faulty lines are suspected in one or several failure traces. Thus, the inner loop of the global debugging process cannot stop because a fault is found. The process must go on until all failures are explained. How can this be done without exploring the entire failure lattice?   Consider any pair of two faults F1 and F2, and F ail F1 and F ail F2 are the sets of failed test cases that detect F1 and F2, respectively. We identify four types of possible dependencies between the two faults.   , we say that they are mutually strongly   we say F1 is strongly dependent (SD) from F2 (and vice versa).   , we say that they are loosely dependent (LD).   , we say that they are independent (ID).   Note that this classification, is not intrinsic to a pair of faults; it depends on the test suite. However, it does not depend arbitrarily from the test suite.   Lemma 5 (How failure dependencies depend on growing test suites) Assume that the test suite can only grow, then an ID or SD pair can only become LD, and an MSD pair can only become SD or LD.   Note  also  that  this  knowledge,  with  several  faults  and  the  dependencies  between  them,  is  what  the debugging  person  is  looking  for,  whereas  the  trace  context  only  gives  hints  at  this  knowledge.  The question is: how does it give hints at this knowledge?   The main idea is to distinguish special concepts in the failure lattice that we call failure concepts.   Definition 8 (Failure concept). A failure concept is a maximally specific concept of the failure lattice whose intent (a set of lines) is contained in a failed execution.   Recall that the failure rules are an abstraction of the failed execution. For instance, choosing minimal support and lift values eliminates lines that are seldom executed or that do not attract failure. Thus, the failure lattice describes exactly the selected failure rules but only approximately the failed executions. That is why it is interesting; it compresses information, though with loss. The failure concepts in the failure lattice are the concepts that best approximate failed executions. All other concepts contain less precise information. For the same reasons, there are much fewer failure concepts than failed executions; each failure concept accounts for a group of failures that detects some fault.   The main use for failure concepts is to give a criterion for stopping the exploration of the failure lattice. In a few words,   •  The bottom-up exploration of the failure lattice goes from support clusters to support clusters   as above;   •  The  line  labels  of  the  traversed  concepts  are  accumulated  in  a  fault  context  sent  to  the   competent debugger;   •  Any time a competent debugger finds a hint at an actual fault, all the failure concepts under the   concept that gave the hint are deemed explained;   •  The process continues until all failure concepts are explained.   The fault context is the part of the program that the debugging person is supposed to check. We consider its size as a measure of the effort imposed on the debugging person (see Section 1.6 for comparative experiments).   Dependencies between faults have an impact on the way failure concepts are presented in the failure   Lemma 6 (ID faults with respect to failure concepts). If two faults are ID, their lines can never occur in the  same  failed  trace,  and  then  no  rule  contains  the  two  faults  and  no  concept  in  the  failure  lattice contains the two faults. Thus, the two faults will label failure concepts in two different support clusters that have no subconcepts in common (for an example, see Figure 7.6).   Concretely, when exploring the failure lattice bottom-up, finding a fault in the label of a concept explains both the concept and the concepts underneath, but the faults in the other upper branches remain to be explained. Moreover, the order with which the different branches are explored does not matter.   Lemma 7 (LD faults with respect to failure concepts). If two faults are LD, some failed traces contain both  faults,  while  other  failed  traces  contain  either  fault.  They  may  label  concepts  in  two  different support clusters that share common subconcepts.   Figure 7.6. Failure lattice associated to program Trityp with ID faults of mutants 1, 2, and 6 [6].   Concretely, when exploring the failure lattice bottom-up, finding a fault for a failure concept does not explain the other LD failure concept. Once a fault is found, shared concepts must be re-explored in the direction of other superconcepts.   Lemma 8 (SD faults with respect to failure concepts). If two faults are SD, say F1 depends on F2, a failure concept whose intent contains LineF1 will appear as a subconcept of a failure concept whose concept contains LineF2 in a different support cluster (for an example, see Figure 7.7).   Therefore, fault F1 will be found before F2, but the debugging process must continue because there is a failure concept above.   Lemma 9 (MSD faults with respect to failure concepts). Finally, if two faults are MSD, they cannot be distinguished  by  failed  executions,  and  their  failure  concepts  belong  to  the  same  support  cluster. However, they can sometimes be distinguished by passed executions (such as one having more passed executions than the other), and this can be seen in the failure lattice through the lift value.   All this can be formalized in an algorithm that searches for multiple faults in an efficient traversal of the   failure lattice (see Algorithm 7.1). The failure lattice is traversed bottom-up, starting with the failure concepts (step 1). At the end of the failure lattice traversal, CfailuretoExplain, the set of failure concepts not explained by a fault (step 2) must be empty, or all concepts must be already explored (step 3). When a concept, c (step 4), is chosen among the concepts to explore, CtoExplore, the events that label the concept are explored. Note that the selection of that concept is not determinist. If no fault is located, then the upper neighbours of c are added  to  the  set  of  concepts  to  explore  (step  7).  If,  thanks  to  the  new  clues,  the  debugging  oracle understands mistakes and locates one or several faults, then all subconcepts of c and all concepts that are in the same support cluster are “explained”.  Those concepts do not have to be explored again (step 10).  This  means  that  the  failure  concepts  that  are  subconcepts  of  c  are  explained  (step  11).  The exploration goes on until all failed executions in the failure lattice are explained by at least one fault, or all concepts have been explored.   Figure 7.7. Failure lattice associated to program Trityp with SD faults 1 and 7 [6].   Algorithm 7.1. Failure lattice traversal [6].   Table 7.6. Exploration of the failure lattice of Figure 7.6 [6].   CtoExplore { c c c c , , ,     } { c c c , ,    { } 9,c c  { c c c , ,    { , , c c c    } { 8,c c   CfailuretoExplain } { c c c c ,     } { c c c , ,    { } 9,c c } { c 9,c { } 9,c c  {}   Note  that  at  each  iteration,  CfailuretoExplain  can  only  decrease  or  remain  untouched.  The  competent debugger hypothesis ensures that CfailuretoExplain ends at empty when min sup is equal to 1. In case of an incompetent debugging oracle or a too high min sup, the process would end when CtoExplore becomes empty, namely when all concepts have been explored.   For the example of Figure 7.6, the min sup value is equal to four failed executions (out of 400 executions, of which there are 168 failed executions), and the min lift value is equal to one. There are four failure concepts: 5, 13, 12, and 9. Table 7.6 presents the values of CtoExplore and CfailuretoExplain at each iteration of the exploration. We choose to explore the lattice with a queue strategy; it means first in CtoExplore, first out of CtoExplore. However, the algorithm does not specify one strategy.   At the begining, CtoExplore and CfailuretoExplain are initialized as the set of all failure concepts (iteration 0 in Table 7.6). At the first iteration of the while loop, concept 5 is selected (c = c5). That concept is labeled by line 74. Line 74 actually corresponds to fault 6. Thanks to the competent debugging hypothesis, fault 6  is  located.  Concepts  5,  4,  and  14  are  thus  tagged  as  explained.  The  new  values  of  CtoExplore  and CfailuretoExplain are presented at iteration 1 in Table 7.6.   At the second iteration, concept 13 is selected (c = c13). That concept is labeled by lines 64 and 79. Line 79 actually corresponds to fault 2; the competent debugging oracle locates fault 2. Concept 13 is tagged as explained. At the third iteration, concept 12 is selected. That concept is labeled by lines 87 and 90. No fault is found. The upper neighbours, concepts 7 and 11, are added to CtoExplore, and CfailuretoExplain is   At the next iteration, concept 9 is selected. As in the previous iteration, no fault is found. The upper neighbour, concept 8, is added to CtoExplore.   Finally, concept 7 is selected. That concept is labeled by lines 81 and 84. By exploring those lines (new clues) in addition with the fault context, i.e., lines that have already been explored: 87, 90, 101, and 85, the competent debugging oracle locates fault 1 at line 84. The fault is the substitution of the test of trityp = 2 by trityp = 3. Concepts 12 and 9 exhibit two concrete realizations (failures) of the fault at line 84 (Concept 7). Concepts 7, 12, and 9 are tagged as explained. The set of failure concepts to explain is empty; thus, the exploration stops. All four faults (for failures above support and lift threshold) are found after the debugging oracle has inspected nine lines.   The contexts and lattices introduced in the previous sections allow programmers to see all the differences between  execution  traces  as  well  as  all  the  differences  between  association  rules.  There  exist  other methods that compute differences between execution traces. We first show that the information about trace differences provided by the failure context (and the corresponding lattice) is already more relevant than the information provided by four other methods proposed by Renieris and Reiss [25] and Cleve and Zeller [7]. Then, we show that explicitly using association rules with several lines in the premise alleviates some limitations of Jones et al.’s method [15]. Finally, we show that reasoning on the partial ordering given by the proposed failure lattice is more relevant than reasoning on total order rankings [8][18][20][24][32].   The trace context contains the whole information about execution traces. In particular, the associated lattice, the trace lattice, allows programmers to see all differences between traces in one pass.   There exist several fault localization methods based on the differences between execution traces. They all assume a single failed execution and several passed executions. We rephrase them in terms of search in a lattice to highlight their advantages, their hidden hypothesis, and limitations.   The union model, proposed by Renieris and Reiss [25], aims at finding features that are specific to the failed execution. The method is based on trace differences between the failed execution f and a set of passed executions S : f -∪s∈Ss. The underlying intuition is that the failure is caused by lines that are executed  only  in  the  failed  execution.  Formalized  in  FCA  terms,  the  concepts  of  interest  are  the subconcepts  whose  label  contains  FAIL,  and  the  computed  information  is  the  lines  contained  in  the labels of the subconcepts. The trace lattice presented in the figure is slightly different from the lattice that  would  be  computed  for  the  union  model,  because  it  represents  more  than  one  failed  execution. Nevertheless,  the  union  model  often  computes  empty  information,  namely  each  time  the  faulty  line belongs to failed and passed execution traces. For example, a fault in a condition has a very slight chance to be localized. The approach we presented is based on the same intuition. However, the lattices that we propose do not lose information and help navigate in order to localize the faults, even when the faulty line belongs to both failed and passed execution traces.   The union model helps localize a bug when executing the faulty statement always implies an error, such as the bad assignment of a variable that is the result of the program. In that case, the lattice also helps, and the faulty statement labels the same concept as FAIL.   The intersection model [25] is the complementary of the previous model. It computes the features whose absence is discriminant of the failed execution: ∩s∈Ss - f. Replacing FAIL with PASS in the above discussion is relevant to discussing the intersection model and leads to the same conclusions.   The nearest neighbor approach [25] computes a distance metric between the failed execution trace and a set of passed execution traces. The computed trace difference involves the failed execution trace, f , and only one passed execution trace, the nearest one, p : f - p. The difference is meant to be the part of the code to explore. The approach can be formalized in FCA. Given a concept Cf whose intent contains FAIL, the nearest neighbor method searches for a concept Cp whose intent contains PASS, such that the intent of Cp shares as many lines as possible with the intent of Cf.   The rightmost concept fails, whereas the leftmost one passes. As for the previous methods, it is a good approach when the execution of the faulty statement always involves an error. However, when the faulty statement can lead to both a passed and a failed execution, the nearest neighbor method is not sufficient. In addition, we remark that there are possibly many concepts of interest, namely all the nearest neighbors of the concept that is labeled by FAIL. With a lattice, that kind of behavior can be observed directly.   Note that in the trace lattice, the executions that execute the same lines are clustered in the label of a single concept. Executions that are nearby share a large part of their executed lines and label concepts that are neighbors in the lattice. There is therefore no reason to restrict the comparison to a single pass execution. Furthermore, all the nearest neighbors are naturally in the lattice.   Delta debugging, proposed by Zeller et al. [8], reasons on the values of variables during executions rather than on executed lines. The trace spectrum, and therefore the trace context, contains different types of attributes. Note that the presented approach does not depend on the type of attributes and would apply more to spectra containing other attributes than executed lines.   Delta  debugging  computes  the  differences  between  the  failed  execution  trace  and  a  single  passed execution trace in a memory graph. By injecting the values of variables of the failed execution into variables of the passed execution, the method tries to determine a small set of suspicious variables. One of the purposes of the method is to find a passed execution relatively similar to the failed execution. It has the same drawbacks as the nearest neighbor method.   Tarantula Jones et al. [15] computed association rules with only one line in the premise. Denmat et al. [10] showed the limitations of this method through three implicit hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that a failure has a single faulty statement origin. The second hypothesis is that lines are independent. The third hypothesis is that executing the faulty statement often causes a failure. That last hypothesis is a common assumption of fault localization methods, including the presented method. Indeed, when the fault is executed in both passed and failed executions (such as in a prelude), it cannot be found so easily using these hypotheses.   In addition, Denmat et al. demonstrated that the ad hoc indicator, which was used by Jones et al., is equivalent to the lift indicator.   By using association rules with more expressive premises than in Jones et al.’s method (namely with several lines), the limitations mentioned above are alleviated. Firstly, the fault need not be a single line but can contain several lines together. Secondly, the dependency between lines is taken into account. Indeed, dependent lines are clustered or ordered together.   The part of the trace context that is important to search in order to localize a fault is the set of concepts that are related to the concept labeled by FAIL; i.e., those that have a non-empty intersection with the concept labeled by FAIL. Computing association rules with FAIL as a conclusion compute exactly those concepts, modulo the minsup and minlift filtering. In other words, the focus is done on the part of the lattice related to the concept labeled by FAIL.   Jones et al.’s method presents the result of the analysis to the user as a coloring of the source code. A red-green gradient indicates the correlation with failure. Lines that are highly correlated with failure are colored  in  red,  whereas  lines  that  are  not  highly  correlated  are  colored  in  green.  Red  lines  typically represent  more  than  10%  of  the  lines  of  the  program,  without  identified  links  between  them.  Other statistical methods [8][18][19][32] also try to rank lines in a total ordering. It can be seen as ordering the concepts of the failure lattice by the lift value of the rule in their label. However, we have shown in Section 1.3 that the monotonicity of lift is only relevant locally to a support cluster.   For example, on the failure lattice of Figure 7.2, the obtained ranking would be: line 85, line 66, line 68, line 84.  No link would be established between the execution of line 85 and line 68, for example.   The user who must localize a fault in a program has background knowledge about the program and can use  it  to  explore  the  failure  lattice.  Reading  the  lattice  gives  context  about  the  fault  and  not  just  a sequence of independent lines to be examined, and it reduces the number of lines to be examined at each step (concept) by structuring them.   We have compared the failure lattice with existing single fault localization methods. In this section, we compare the presented navigation in the failure lattice with the strategies of the other methods to detect several faults.   The presented approach involves algorithmic debugging [27]. The difference lies in the traversed data structure. While Shapiro’s algorithm helps traverse a proof tree, the presented algorithm helps traverse the failure lattice, starting from the most suspicious places.   For multiple faults, Jiang et al. [14] criticized the ranking of statistical methods. They proposed a method based on traces whose events are predicates. The predicates are clustered, and the path in the control flow  graph  associated  to  each  cluster  is  computed.  In  the  failure  lattice,  events  are  also  clustered  in concepts. The relations between concepts give information about the path in the control flow graph and highlight some parts of that path as relevant to debug without computing the control flow graph.   Zheng  et  al.  [32]  proposed  a  method  based  on  bi-clustering  in  order  to  group  failed  executions  and identify one feature (bug predictor) that characterizes each cluster. They proposed to look at one bug predictor at a time. Several bug predictors can be in relation with the same fault, but no link is drawn between  them.  The  presented  approach  gives  context  to  the  fault,  in  order  to  help  understand  the",

         "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has significant potential in the treatment of dermatological, oncological, and nonneoplastic conditions through the induction of cell death, immune regulation, antimicrobial effects, etc. However, the response of some patients is unsatisfactory, and there is a lack of an ideal protocol for multiple specific diseases (subtypes) to choose the proper photosensitizer (PS), light source, and dose. A thorough understanding of the underlying mechanism is integral to solving these problems, and cell death has gained much attention. In addition to apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis, several novel cell death pathways, such as necroptosis, mitotic catastrophe, paraptosis and pyroptosis, have been reported in PDT treatment. The type of induced cell death depends on the dose of PDT, the subcellular location of PSs, and the regulation of signaling pathways. In addition, different types of cell death induced by the same type of PDT, such as apoptosis and autophagy, may interact with each other. Some types of cell death can also trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can ignite an immune response against antigens derived from dying/dead cells and present improved antitumor effects. On the basis of these mechanisms, several strategies, such as targeted PSs, PDT combined with immunotherapy and ICD‐based vaccines, have been proposed to improve therapeutic efficacy. Future studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between cell death and therapeutic effects and to shed new light on the exploration of precise PDT for specific patients.",

It shows spread of an advantageous\ngene in a population. The existence of solutions and travelling waves was demonstrated in 1937. The analysis and study of the\nFisher equation is used to model heat and reaction-diﬀusion problems applied to mathematical biology, physics, astrophysics,\nchemistry, genetics, bacterial growth problems as well as development and growth of solid tumours. There are several variations\nof the FK equation, let us show few of them.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOne of the well-known models is the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation or the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation,\nwhich was proposed, on the one hand, by Fisher 1 who described the spread of an advantageous gene in a population; and on the\nother hand, by Kolmogorov et al. 2 who additionally obtained the basic analytical results for this equation. This two-dimensional\nFK equation has the following form:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n𝑢𝑡 = 𝑎𝑢(1 − 𝑢) + 𝑏 Δ𝑢,\n(1)\nwhere 𝑢 is the frequency of the mutant gene, 𝑎 is an intrinsic coeﬃcient, Δ = 𝜕2∕𝜕𝑥2 + 𝜕2∕𝜕𝑦2 is the Laplace operator, and 𝑏 is\nthe diﬀusion constant.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn 3, the following generalized Fisher equation was considered\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhere the diﬀusivity depends on an arbitrary function 𝑔(𝑢), being 𝑥 and 𝑡 the independent variables, and 𝑓 (𝑢) an arbitrary\nfunction. For equation (2), some non-trivial conservation laws have been obtained.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n𝑢𝑡 = 𝑓 (𝑢) + (𝑔(𝑢)𝑢𝑥)𝑥,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAnother generalized Fisher equation was considered in 4\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n𝑥\nwhere 𝑥 is used as the radial variable, 𝑔(𝑢) is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and 𝑓 (𝑢) is an arbitrary function. For equation (3) the Lie\ngroup classiﬁcation was obtained, and all the reductions were derived from the optimal system of subalgebras. Moreover, as\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n(𝑥𝑔(𝑢)𝑢𝑥)𝑥,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsome of the reduced equations admit Lie symmetries, further reductions were derived. In addition, some exact wave solutions\nwere obtained by using a direct method.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nThe so called inhomogeneous FK equation,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\n𝑢𝑡 = [𝑎(𝑥) − 𝑐(𝑥)𝑢] 𝑢𝑛 +\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwas considered in 5. Equation (4) models the population grow in an heterogeneous environment. Here, the inhomogeneity\nappears in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient 𝑏(𝑥) and the intrinsic growth rate 𝑎(𝑥). The simplest function to consider as inhomogeneity\nis a periodic function. As a result, the spread of population waves located in a bounded region leads to formation and devel-\nopment of periodic patterns moving with a constant velocity. It is observed that the restriction by a ﬁnite continuous function\nindicates that it is quite natural to choose the simplest form for the function 𝑐(𝑥) = 1\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAdditionally, in 6 was studied how inhomogeneities in equation (4) inﬂuence on the population invasions and the velocity of\nperiodic waves. This case was considered with 𝑎, 𝑏 constants and 𝑛 = 1. In order to study the previous systems, they considered\nthe equation in the general form\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n𝑢2\n𝐾(𝑥)\nThe solutions for (5) obtained in 5,6 admit negative values for the function 𝑢. However, in the context of the population dynamics\nthis function should be non-negative, i.e. in the simplest case it should have the form 𝑢(𝑥, 𝑡) ∝ 1 + cos(𝑥) instead of cos(𝑥).\nTherefore, to ﬁnd the exact solution for such “real” waves they considered a more general variant of the FK equation with\ninhomogeneous reaction and diﬀusion terms. So, equation (4) was considered with 𝑛 = 1. Hence, all inhomogeneities have\nsimilar non-negative dependencies. Particular cases were studied to obtain exact analytical solutions. For example, for 𝑎(𝑥) =\n𝑐0\n, 𝑏(𝑥) = 𝑏0(1 + cos(𝑥)) and 𝑛 = 1, with 𝑎0, 𝑏0, 𝑐0 arbitrary constants, the authors showed that\n3𝑏0(1 + cos(𝑥)), 𝑐(𝑥) =\n1+cos(𝑥)\nequation (4) admits the solution\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nwhere 𝑘 is an arbitrary constant.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n3𝑏0(1 + cos(𝑥))\n𝑒𝑘−3𝑏0𝑡 + 𝑐0\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nIn this paper, we analyse a two-dimensional generalization of equation (5) given by\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n𝑢𝑡 = 𝑎𝑢 − 𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) 𝑢2 + 𝑏\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.4**\n𝑢𝑥𝑥 + 𝑢𝑦𝑦\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhere 𝑏 is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, 𝑎 is the intrinsic growth rate, and the inhomogeneity can be factorized in the form\n𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) 6. For computational aspects, 𝑀(𝑥), 𝑁(𝑦) have been considered in the numerator. The variable 𝑢 represents the\npopulation density, so 𝑢 is non-negative. The term 𝑎𝑢 represents a source if 𝑎 > 0 or a sink if 𝑎 < 0, and 𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) will\nbe considered non-negative since −𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦)𝑢2 represents a sink. Equation (7) is called the generalized (2+1)-dimensional\ninhomogeneous Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. Some special solutions of (7) have been obtained in 6.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLie symmetry method allows us to reduce the number of independent variables of a given partial diﬀerential equation (PDE).\nIn particular, it allows to reduce a (2+1)-dimensional PDE into a (1+1)-dimensional PDE. When a PDE in 2 + 1 dimensions\nadmits a 2-dimensional subalgebra of symmetries, then it is possible to reduce the PDE to an ordinary diﬀerential equation\n(ODE). Therefore, the Lie method is an important and eﬃcient tool for analysing diﬀerential equations 7,8. Applications of the\nLie method include determining invariant solutions, constructing maps between equivalent equations, determining conserved\nquantities when the PDE admits a Lagrangian formulation, and so on. Symmetries have been obtained for two dimensional\nmodels to look for exact solutions in 9,10,11 with eﬀective results.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe main purpose of the present paper is to obtain new solutions for equation (7). We focus our attention on the determination\nof invariant solutions, i.e. solutions which are invariant under the action of Lie symmetry groups. First, we carry out a classiﬁca-\ntion of Lie point symmetries admitted by equation (7). For simplicity, it is assumed that 𝑀(𝑥) are 𝑁(𝑦) are exponential functions.\nA complete study of the symmetries for arbitrary 𝑀(𝑥) are 𝑁(𝑦) will appear elsewhere. In addition, we present the symmetry\ntransformation groups corresponding to the admitted point symmetries. Next, we ﬁnd some exact solutions for equation (7), tak-\ning into account two-dimensional subalgebras admitted by the equation, and we interpret those solutions.

         " Lie symmetries and travelling wave solutions of the nonlinear waves in the inhomogeneous Fisher-Kolmogorov equation.   M.S. Bruzón* | T.M. Garrido | E. Recio | R. de la Rosa   In this work we consider a Fisher-Kolmogorov equation depending on two exponen- tial functions of the spatial variables. We study this equation from the point of view   of symmetry reductions in partial diﬀerential equations. Through two-dimensional abelian subalgebras, the equation is reduced to ordinary diﬀerential equations. New   solutions have been derived and interpreted.   In 1930, the Fisher-Kolmogorov (FK) equation was proposed for populations dynamics. It shows spread of an advantageous gene in a population. The existence of solutions and travelling waves was demonstrated in 1937. The analysis and study of the Fisher equation is used to model heat and reaction-diﬀusion problems applied to mathematical biology, physics, astrophysics, chemistry, genetics, bacterial growth problems as well as development and growth of solid tumours. There are several variations of the FK equation, let us show few of them.   One of the well-known models is the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation or the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation, which was proposed, on the one hand, by Fisher 1 who described the spread of an advantageous gene in a population; and on the other hand, by Kolmogorov et al. 2 who additionally obtained the basic analytical results for this equation. This two-dimensional FK equation has the following form:   𝑢𝑡 = 𝑎𝑢(1 − 𝑢) + 𝑏 Δ𝑢, (1) where 𝑢 is the frequency of the mutant gene, 𝑎 is an intrinsic coeﬃcient, Δ = 𝜕2∕𝜕𝑥2 + 𝜕2∕𝜕𝑦2 is the Laplace operator, and 𝑏 is the diﬀusion constant.   In 3, the following generalized Fisher equation was considered   where the diﬀusivity depends on an arbitrary function 𝑔(𝑢), being 𝑥 and 𝑡 the independent variables, and 𝑓 (𝑢) an arbitrary function. For equation (2), some non-trivial conservation laws have been obtained.   𝑢𝑡 = 𝑓 (𝑢) + (𝑔(𝑢)𝑢𝑥)𝑥,   Another generalized Fisher equation was considered in 4   𝑥 where 𝑥 is used as the radial variable, 𝑔(𝑢) is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and 𝑓 (𝑢) is an arbitrary function. For equation (3) the Lie group classiﬁcation was obtained, and all the reductions were derived from the optimal system of subalgebras. Moreover, as   (𝑥𝑔(𝑢)𝑢𝑥)𝑥,   some of the reduced equations admit Lie symmetries, further reductions were derived. In addition, some exact wave solutions were obtained by using a direct method.   The so called inhomogeneous FK equation,   𝑢𝑡 = [𝑎(𝑥) − 𝑐(𝑥)𝑢] 𝑢𝑛 +   was considered in 5. Equation (4) models the population grow in an heterogeneous environment. Here, the inhomogeneity appears in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient 𝑏(𝑥) and the intrinsic growth rate 𝑎(𝑥). The simplest function to consider as inhomogeneity is a periodic function. As a result, the spread of population waves located in a bounded region leads to formation and devel- opment of periodic patterns moving with a constant velocity. It is observed that the restriction by a ﬁnite continuous function indicates that it is quite natural to choose the simplest form for the function 𝑐(𝑥) = 1   Additionally, in 6 was studied how inhomogeneities in equation (4) inﬂuence on the population invasions and the velocity of periodic waves. This case was considered with 𝑎, 𝑏 constants and 𝑛 = 1. In order to study the previous systems, they considered the equation in the general form   𝑢2 𝐾(𝑥) The solutions for (5) obtained in 5,6 admit negative values for the function 𝑢. However, in the context of the population dynamics this function should be non-negative, i.e. in the simplest case it should have the form 𝑢(𝑥, 𝑡) ∝ 1 + cos(𝑥) instead of cos(𝑥). Therefore, to ﬁnd the exact solution for such “real” waves they considered a more general variant of the FK equation with inhomogeneous reaction and diﬀusion terms. So, equation (4) was considered with 𝑛 = 1. Hence, all inhomogeneities have similar non-negative dependencies. Particular cases were studied to obtain exact analytical solutions. For example, for 𝑎(𝑥) = 𝑐0 , 𝑏(𝑥) = 𝑏0(1 + cos(𝑥)) and 𝑛 = 1, with 𝑎0, 𝑏0, 𝑐0 arbitrary constants, the authors showed that 3𝑏0(1 + cos(𝑥)), 𝑐(𝑥) = 1+cos(𝑥) equation (4) admits the solution   where 𝑘 is an arbitrary constant.   3𝑏0(1 + cos(𝑥)) 𝑒𝑘−3𝑏0𝑡 + 𝑐0   In this paper, we analyse a two-dimensional generalization of equation (5) given by   𝑢𝑡 = 𝑎𝑢 − 𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) 𝑢2 + 𝑏   where 𝑏 is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, 𝑎 is the intrinsic growth rate, and the inhomogeneity can be factorized in the form 𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) 6. For computational aspects, 𝑀(𝑥), 𝑁(𝑦) have been considered in the numerator. The variable 𝑢 represents the population density, so 𝑢 is non-negative. The term 𝑎𝑢 represents a source if 𝑎 > 0 or a sink if 𝑎 < 0, and 𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) will be considered non-negative since −𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦)𝑢2 represents a sink. Equation (7) is called the generalized (2+1)-dimensional inhomogeneous Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. Some special solutions of (7) have been obtained in 6.   Lie symmetry method allows us to reduce the number of independent variables of a given partial diﬀerential equation (PDE). In particular, it allows to reduce a (2+1)-dimensional PDE into a (1+1)-dimensional PDE. When a PDE in 2 + 1 dimensions admits a 2-dimensional subalgebra of symmetries, then it is possible to reduce the PDE to an ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE). Therefore, the Lie method is an important and eﬃcient tool for analysing diﬀerential equations 7,8. Applications of the Lie method include determining invariant solutions, constructing maps between equivalent equations, determining conserved quantities when the PDE admits a Lagrangian formulation, and so on. Symmetries have been obtained for two dimensional models to look for exact solutions in 9,10,11 with eﬀective results.   The main purpose of the present paper is to obtain new solutions for equation (7). We focus our attention on the determination of invariant solutions, i.e. solutions which are invariant under the action of Lie symmetry groups. First, we carry out a classiﬁca- tion of Lie point symmetries admitted by equation (7). For simplicity, it is assumed that 𝑀(𝑥) are 𝑁(𝑦) are exponential functions. A complete study of the symmetries for arbitrary 𝑀(𝑥) are 𝑁(𝑦) will appear elsewhere. In addition, we present the symmetry transformation groups corresponding to the admitted point symmetries. Next, we ﬁnd some exact solutions for equation (7), tak- ing into account two-dimensional subalgebras admitted by the equation, and we interpret those solutions. Finally, we give some conclusions.   We apply the Lie group method of inﬁnitesimal transformations to equation (7) in the case 𝑀(𝑥) = 𝑚1𝑒𝑝𝑥, 𝑁(𝑦) = 𝑛1𝑒𝑞𝑦. Following references 7,8, we consider a one-parameter Lie group of inﬁnitesimals transformations acting on independent and dependent variables given by   ̃𝑡 = 𝑡 + 𝜀𝜏(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢) + (𝜀2), ̃𝑥 = 𝑥 + 𝜀𝜉𝑥(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢) + (𝜀2), ̃𝑦 = 𝑦 + 𝜀𝜉𝑦(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢) + (𝜀2), ̃𝑢 = 𝑢 + 𝜀𝜙(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢) + (𝜀2),   where 𝜀 is the group parameter and the associated vector ﬁeld takes the following form   𝑋 = 𝜏(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢)𝜕𝑡 + 𝜉𝑥(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢)𝜕𝑥 + 𝜉𝑦(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢)𝜕𝑦 + 𝜙(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢)𝜕𝑢.   The invariance criterion implies   with Δ = 𝑢𝑡 − 𝑎𝑢 + 𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦)𝑢2 − 𝑏   pr(2)𝑋Δ = 0, where Δ = 0, (9) , and where pr(2)𝑋 is the second prolongation of the vector ﬁeld (8) deﬁned by   pr(2)𝑋 = 𝑋 + 𝜙𝑡   with coeﬃcients   𝜙𝑡 = 𝐷𝑡(𝜂) − 𝑢𝑡𝐷𝑡(𝜏) − 𝑢𝑥𝐷𝑡(𝜉𝑥) − 𝑢𝑦𝐷𝑡(𝜉𝑦), 𝜙𝑥 = 𝐷𝑥(𝜂) − 𝑢𝑡𝐷𝑥(𝜏) − 𝑢𝑥𝐷𝑥(𝜉𝑥) − 𝑢𝑦𝐷𝑥(𝜉𝑦), 𝜙𝑦 = 𝐷𝑦(𝜂) − 𝑢𝑡𝐷𝑦(𝜏) − 𝑢𝑥𝐷𝑦(𝜉𝑥) − 𝑢𝑦𝐷𝑦(𝜉𝑦), 𝜙𝑥𝑥 = 𝐷𝑥(𝜙𝑥) − 𝑢𝑡𝑥𝐷𝑥(𝜏) − 𝑢𝑥𝑥𝐷𝑥(𝜉𝑥) − 𝑢𝑦𝑥𝐷𝑥(𝜉𝑦), 𝜙𝑥𝑦 = 𝐷𝑦(𝜙𝑥) − 𝑢𝑡𝑦𝐷𝑦(𝜏) − 𝑢𝑥𝑦𝐷𝑦(𝜉𝑥) − 𝑢𝑦𝑦𝐷𝑦(𝜉𝑦), 𝜙𝑦𝑦 = 𝐷𝑦(𝜙𝑦) − 𝑢𝑡𝑦𝐷𝑦(𝜏) − 𝑢𝑥𝑦𝐷𝑦(𝜉𝑥) − 𝑢𝑦𝑦𝐷𝑦(𝜉𝑦),   where 𝐷𝑡, 𝐷𝑥, 𝐷𝑦 are the total derivatives of 𝑡, 𝑥 and 𝑦, respectively.   Equation (9) splits with respect to the derivatives of 𝑢. This yields an overdetermined linear system of equations for the inﬁnitesimals 𝜏(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢), 𝜉𝑥(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢), 𝜉𝑦(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢), 𝜙(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢) along with functions 𝑀(𝑥), 𝑁(𝑦) and the parameters 𝑎 and 𝑏, with the conditions 𝑀(𝑥) ≠ 0, 𝑁(𝑦) ≠ 0, 𝑎 ≠ 0 and 𝑏 ≠ 0. Equation (7) has several obvious discrete equivalence transformations. In particular, it should be noted that it admits the discrete equivalence transformation 𝑁 ←→ ̃𝑀,   i.e., a transformation under which 𝑥 and 𝑦 are interchanged along with 𝑀(𝑥) and 𝑁(𝑦).   From the overdetermined linear system of equations we deduce that 𝜏 = 𝜏(𝑡), 𝜉𝑥 = 𝜉𝑥(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦), 𝜉𝑦 = 𝜉𝑦(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦), 𝜙 = 𝜙(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢),   where 𝜏, 𝜉𝑥, 𝜉𝑦, 𝜙, 𝑀 and 𝑁, must satisfy the system   𝜙𝑢𝑢 = 0, 𝜏𝑡 = 2𝜉𝑥 𝑥, 𝑥 = −𝜉𝑥 𝜉𝑦 𝑦 , 𝑦 = 𝜉𝑥 𝜉𝑦 𝑥,   ) 𝜉𝑦 𝑡 , 𝑥 + 𝑀𝑥𝑁𝑢2𝜉𝑥 + 𝑀𝑁𝑦𝑢2𝜉𝑦 = 0. 𝜉𝑥   𝑥𝑥 + 𝑏𝜉𝑥 𝑦𝑦 −1 2𝑏   + (𝑎 − 𝑀𝑁𝑢) 𝑢𝜙𝑢 + (−𝑎 + 2𝑀𝑁𝑢) 𝜙 +   𝜙𝑥𝑥 + 𝜙𝑦𝑦 (   ( We solve this system for the case 𝑀(𝑥) = 𝑚1𝑒𝑝𝑥 and 𝑁(𝑦) = 𝑛1𝑒𝑞𝑦 by using Maple \"rifsimp\" and \"pdsolve\" commands. Thus,   we obtain the following result.   Theorem 1. The complete classiﬁcation of the point symmetries admitted by the (2+1)-dimensional inhomogeneous Fisher- Kolmogorov equation (7) with 𝑀(𝑥) = 𝑚1𝑒𝑝𝑥, 𝑁(𝑦) = 𝑛1𝑒𝑞𝑦 is given by:   • Case 1. For 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑚1, 𝑛1 non-zero arbitrary parameters and 𝑝, 𝑞 arbitrary parameters, the inﬁnitesimal generators are   𝑋1 = 𝜕𝑡, 𝑋2 = 𝜕𝑥 − 𝑝𝑢𝜕𝑢, 𝑋2′ = 𝜕𝑦 − 𝑞𝑢𝜕𝑢, 𝑋3 = (−𝑦 + 2𝑏𝑞𝑡) 𝜕𝑥 + (𝑥 − 2𝑏𝑝𝑡) 𝜕𝑦 + (𝑝𝑦 − 𝑞𝑥) 𝑢𝜕𝑢.   • Case 2. For 𝑎 = −𝑏   , the inﬁnitesimal generators are 𝑋1, 𝑋2, 𝑋2′ , 𝑋3 and   ( 𝑝𝑞𝑥 + 𝑏𝑝2𝑞𝑡 −   𝑝𝑞𝑦 + 𝑏𝑝𝑞2𝑡 −   Each symmetry (8) generates a transformation obtained by solving the following system of ODEs   = 𝜉𝑥(̃𝑡, ̃𝑥, ̃𝑦, ̃𝑢),   = 𝜉𝑦(̃𝑡, ̃𝑥, ̃𝑦, ̃𝑢),   satisfying the initial conditions   with 𝜖 the group parameter. Point symmetries (18)-(22) produce the following one-parameter symmetry transformation groups:   (̃𝑡, ̃𝑥, ̃𝑦, ̃𝑢)1 = (𝑡 + 𝜖, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑢),   time translation,   (̃𝑡, ̃𝑥, ̃𝑦, ̃𝑢)2 = (𝑡, 𝑥 + 𝜖, 𝑦, 𝑒−𝑝𝜖𝑢),   scaling in 𝑢 combined with translation in 𝑥,   (̃𝑡, ̃𝑥, ̃𝑦, ̃𝑢)2′ = (𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦 + 𝜖, 𝑒−𝑞𝜖𝑢),   scaling in 𝑢 combined with translation in 𝑦,   𝑡, (𝑥 − 2𝑏𝑝𝑡) cos(𝜖) + (2𝑏𝑞𝑡 − 𝑦) sin(𝜖) + 2𝑏𝑝𝑡, (𝑦 − 2𝑏𝑞𝑡) cos(𝜖) + (𝑥 − 2𝑏𝑝𝑡) sin(𝜖) + 2𝑏𝑞𝑡,   (𝑝𝑦 − 𝑞𝑥) sin(𝜖) + (2𝑏𝑝2𝑡 − 𝑝𝑥 + 𝑏𝑞2𝑡 − 𝑞𝑦)(cos(𝜖) − 1)   dilation combined with a rotation in the plane (𝑥, 𝑦),   𝑒𝜖𝑡, (𝑒𝜖∕2 − 1)(2𝑏𝑝𝑒𝜖∕2𝑡 − 1 𝑝 (   ) + 𝑒𝜖∕2𝑥, (𝑒𝜖∕2 − 1)(2𝑏𝑞𝑒𝜖∕2𝑡 − 1 𝑞   (2𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2)𝑡 − 𝑝𝑥 − 𝑞𝑦 + 2)𝑒𝜖∕2 − 2𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2)𝑒𝜖𝑡 + 𝑝𝑥 + 𝑞𝑦 − 𝜖 − 2   dilation combined with a scaling.   Point symmetries of equation (7) can be used to transform it into equations with fewer number of independent variables. In order to determine exact solutions of equation (7), we focus our attention in two-dimensional abelian subalgebras. Thus, equation (7) can be reduced into a second-order nonlinear ODE.   Reduction under the two-dimensional abelian subalgebra 3.1 Consider 𝑀(𝑥) = 𝑚1𝑒𝑝𝑥 and 𝑁(𝑦) = 𝑛1𝑒𝑞𝑦 and the two-dimensional abelian subalgebra   𝑋1 − 𝛼𝑋2, 𝑋2′ + 𝛽𝑋2   𝑋1 − 𝛼𝑋2, 𝑋2′ + 𝛽𝑋2 (   By taking into account the two-dimensional abelian subalgebra (23) one can reduce (7) into a nonlinear second-order ODE.   Let 𝑋 = 𝑋1 − 𝛼𝑋2 and 𝑌 = 𝑋2′ + 𝛽𝑋2. Consequently, one looks for two independent invariants 𝑧 and 𝑤 satisfying   From (24) we obtain   𝑧 = −𝑥 + 𝛽𝑦 − 𝛼𝑡,   𝑤 = 𝑒𝑝𝑥+𝑞𝑦𝑢.   𝑢 = 𝑒−(𝑝𝑥+𝑞𝑦)𝑤 (−𝑥 + 𝛽𝑦 − 𝛼𝑡) ,   is a group-invariant solution. The group-invariant solution (25) reduces equation (7) into a second-order ODE, given by   2𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 𝛼 𝑏(𝛽2 + 1)   𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2) + 𝑎 𝑏(𝛽2 + 1)   In 12, the author obtained the general solution of a second-order ODE of the form   with 𝑐0 an arbitrary constant and 𝜆, 𝜇 and 𝜔 satisfying the constraint 6𝜇2 25𝜆   Equation (26) can be written in the same form that equation (27) by considering   2𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 𝛼 2𝑚1𝑛1 𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2) − 𝑎 2𝑚1𝑛1   where the constraint (28) takes the form   25𝑏(𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2) + 𝑎)(𝛽2 + 1) = 6 (2𝑏(𝑝 − 𝛽𝑞) + 𝛼)2 .   So, the general solution of equation (26) is given by   + 𝑐1, 0, 𝑐2) in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic function with invariants 𝑔2 = 0 and 𝑔3 = 𝑐2, where 𝑐1, 𝑐2 are arbitrary constants.   5𝑏(𝛽2 + 1) 4𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 2𝛼   (2𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 𝛼)𝑧 5𝑏(𝛽2 + 1)   2(2𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 𝛼)𝑧 5𝑏(𝛽2 + 1)   Finally, by undoing the change of variables (25), we obtain the following solution of the (2+1)-dimensional inhomogeneous   Fisher-Kolmogorov equation (7):   5𝑏(𝛽2 + 1) 4𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 2𝛼   2(2𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 𝛼)(𝛽𝑦 − 𝑥 − 𝛼𝑡) 5𝑏(𝛽2 + 1)   ( (2𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 𝛼)(𝛽𝑦 − 𝑥 − 𝛼𝑡) 5𝑏(𝛽2 + 1)   Solution (35) can be interpreted by considering the geometrical form of the travelling wave variable   𝑧 = −𝑥 + 𝛽𝑦 − 𝛼𝑡 =   where 𝐤 = (−1, 𝛽) is a constant vector in the (𝑥, 𝑦)-plane,   is its modulus, and where ̂𝐤 is the unit vector   | ̂𝐤 = (cos 𝜙, sin 𝜙),   giving the direction of propagation of the solution, with speed   Since the coeﬃcient of 𝑢2 in equation (7) is given by 𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) = 𝑚1𝑛1𝑒𝑝𝑥+𝑞𝑦, to interpret the solution, it is natural to consider 𝑝𝑥 + 𝑞𝑦 = (𝑝, 𝑞) ⋅ (𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝐥 ⋅ 𝐱 =   (𝑝, 𝑞) is the unit vector. In addition, by considering   ̂𝐥 ⋅ 𝐱, where ̂𝐥 =   4𝑏(𝛽𝑞 − 𝑝) − 2𝛼 5𝑏(𝛽2 + 1)   the solution (35) can be rewritten as   ) Because of the nature of the equation (7), the diﬀusion coeﬃcient 𝑏 > 0, the growth rate 𝑎 could be positive or negative, and the parameters 𝜎 and 𝜈 should be positives. When we consider 𝑐2 = 0 and 𝑐1 ≠ 0 such that 1 + 𝑐1 ≠ 0, then solution (40) is a shock transition when 𝐱 is orthogonal to 𝐥. For the values of the parameters 𝛾 = 1, 𝜈 = 1, 𝛼 = −1, we show in Figure 1 the shock transition solution (40) at (𝑡, 0, 0) for diﬀerent values of 𝑐1. In other case, solution (40) is the product of an exponential function and a real periodic function with period 𝑐2, which blows-up in ﬁnite times. See Figure 2 .   FIGURE 1 Shock solution (40) at (𝑡, 0, 0) with 𝑐1 = 50 (solid), 𝑐1 = 1 (dash), 𝑐1 = 10−4 (dot).   3.2 Reduction under the two-dimensional abelian subalgebra Consider 𝑀(𝑥) = 𝑚1𝑒𝑝𝑥 and 𝑁(𝑦) = 𝑛1𝑒𝑞𝑦 and the two-dimensional abelian subalgebra   𝑋2, 𝑋2′ ( By taking into account the two-dimensional abelian subalgebra (41), one can reduce (7) into a nonlinear ﬁrst-order ODE. Let   𝑋 = 𝑋2 and 𝑌 = 𝑋2′. From (24), we obtain two independent invariants 𝑧 and 𝑤 given by   𝑤 = 𝑒𝑝𝑥+𝑞𝑦𝑢.   𝑢 = 𝑒−(𝑝𝑥−𝑞𝑦)𝑤 (𝑡) , (42) is a group-invariant solution. Taking into account the group-invariant solution (42), equation (7) reduces into the ﬁrst-order ODE   FIGURE 2 Solution (40) at (𝑡, 0, 0) which blows-up in ﬁnite times.   whose general solution is given by   Undoing transformation (42), the general solution of the (2+1)-dimensional inhomogeneous Fisher-Kolmogorov equation (7) is   𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2) + 𝑎 𝑐1(𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2) + 𝑎)𝑒−(𝑏(𝑝2+𝑞2)+𝑎)𝑧 + 𝑚1𝑛1   To interpret the previous solution, we rewrite it in a geometrical form. Since the coeﬃcient of 𝑢2 in equation (7) is given by ̂𝐥 ⋅ 𝐱, where 𝑀(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) = 𝑚1𝑛1𝑒𝑝𝑥+𝑞𝑦, to interpret the solution, it is natural to consider 𝑝𝑥 + 𝑞𝑦 = (𝑝, 𝑞) ⋅ (𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝐥 ⋅ 𝐱 = ̂𝐥 =   (𝑝, 𝑞) is the unit vector, and   𝛾 = 𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2) + 𝑎 = 𝑏 𝑏(𝑝2 + 𝑞2) + 𝑎 𝜈 = 𝑐1 𝜎 = 𝑚1𝑛1.   Hence, solution (45) can be rewritten as   𝛾𝑒− 𝜈𝑒−𝛾𝑡 + 𝜎 | |   Because of the nature of the equation (7), the diﬀusion coeﬃcient 𝑏 > 0, the growth rate 𝑎 could be positive or negative, and also the arbitrary parameter 𝜈. We examine the case with 𝜈 > 0 and 𝑎 > 0. In Figures 3 and 4 , the solution (47) with 𝑎 = 2, 𝑏 = 1, 𝑝 = 1, 𝑞 = 2, 𝜎 = 2, 𝜈 = 3, is shown. Figure 3 shows the shock transition solution (47) at (𝑡, 0, 0), while Figure 4 shows the spatial distribution of solution (47), which is an exponential sheet.   In this paper we have obtained all the Lie point symmetries admitted by the generalized Fisher-Kolmogorov equation in (2+1)- dimensions (7) with two exponential functions. By using the commutation of those point symmetries, two abelian subalgebras of dimension two have been considered. Hence, the (2+1)-dimensional inhomogeneous Fisher-Kolmogorov equation is reduced   FIGURE 3 Shock transition solution (47) 𝑢(𝑡, 0, 0) =   FIGURE 4 Spatial distribution of solution (47)) 𝑢(0, 𝑥, 𝑦) =   to ordinary diﬀerential equations. The new solutions obtained for (7) represent a shock transition, blows-up in ﬁnite times and exponential sheet behaviour. For future work, we plan to study the Lie symmetries of equation (7) for the case when 𝑀(𝑥) and 𝑁(𝑦) are arbitrary functions, and to use systematically all of the admitted Lie symmetries in order to get exact solutions.

Subsequently, BiFeO3 films were grown on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nan  n-type  Si(100)  substrate  at  various  substrate  temperatures  (TS)  and  oxygen  partial  pressures\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(O2pp)  using  the  pulsed  laser  deposition  (PLD)  technique.18,19  A  Nd:  YAG-based  pulsed  laser\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwith  a  fluence  of  2.7  J/cm2,  pulse  width  of  19  ns,  wavelength  of  355  nm,  and  frequency\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrepetition  of  10  Hz  was  used  to  grow  the  BiFeO3  films  on  Si(100)  substrates.  The  target  and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsubstrates  were  fixed  in  their  respective  positions  in  the  vacuum  chamber,  which  was  then\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nevacuated to a base pressure of 5 × 10-6 mbar using rotary and diffusion pumps. The substrates\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwere  heated  to  temperatures  ranging  from  TS  =  525  oC  to  TS  =  625  oC  with  25  oC  increments\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nusing a heater attached to the substrate holder. Oxygen gas was partially filled in the chamber to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreach a constant O2pp of 0.06 mbar during the growth of BiFeO3 films at the different substrate\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntemperatures. The growth time for all films was 10 minutes. After growth, the films were in-situ\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nannealed  at  the  respective  growth  temperature  with  O2pp  of  100  mbar  for  1  hour,  followed  by\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncooling to room temperature under the same O2pp. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngrown films were recorded (with a scan rate of 0.016o) and analyzed using a PANalytical X’Pert\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nX-ray  diffractometer  with  Cu  Kα  (λ  =  1.5406  Å)  X-ray  line.  The  results  based  on  the  XRD\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nanalysis of all grown films are given in section 3.1. From this analysis, it was apparent that the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noptimized  growth  condition  was  TS  =  575  oC  with  O2pp  =  0.06  mbar  to  grow  a  single-phase\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe microstructure of the optimized BiFeO3 film grown at TS = 575 oC and O2pp = 0.06 mbar\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwas examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nat  room  temperature.  Subsequently,  the  film  was  subjected  to  temperature-  and  magnetic  field\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(H)-dependent magnetization (M) measurements (M vs. T and M vs. H) using a physical property\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmeasurement system (PPMS from Quantum Design, USA). Following this, the Raman spectrum\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof  the  BiFeO3  film  was  obtained  at  room  temperature  in  a  backscattering  geometry  using  a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHoriba-Jobin-Yvon HR8000 Raman spectrometer with a He-Ne laser emitting at a wavelength of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n632.8 nm. Lastly, a comprehensive analysis of the optical and elemental properties of the BiFeO3\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfilm at room temperature was conducted using a Cary 5E UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe XRD patterns of all grown films in this study are available in the supplementary information\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(refer  to  Figs.

A  semi-log  plot  of  a  phase  diagram  illustrating  the  relationship\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbetween oxygen pressure and growth temperature was plotted to show the formation of different\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nphases,  including  the  desired  rhombohedral  phase  of  BiFeO3  (left  inset  of  Fig.  1).  It  was\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nobserved that the secondary phase Bi4Fe7O9 was mainly formed along with the desired BiFeO3\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nphase at a low temperature of TS = 525 oC. Conversely, the film grown at a high temperature of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTS = 625 oC was largely amorphous, although the BiFeO3 phase was still present. The preferred\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nphase of BiFeO3 was found to be primarily formed at intermediate temperatures, TS = 550–600\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noC (Fig. S1). The film grown at TS = 575  oC exhibited better crystalline nature compared to the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfilms grown at other intermediate temperatures, as indicated by the XRD study (left inset of Fig.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n1).  Subsequently,  BiFeO3  films  were  deposited  at  different  O2pp  (6  ×  10-3–3  mbar)  while\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmaintaining a fixed temperature of TS = 575 oC (Fig. S2). The film grown at a high O2 pressure\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof  3  mbar  showed  the  presence  of  parasitic  phases  such  as  Bi2O3  and  Fe2O3,  while  the  film\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngrown at a low O2 pressure of 6 × 10-3 mbar was predominantly amorphous with low-intensity\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npeaks of BiFeO3. The XRD analyses of these films revealed that the film grown at TS = 575 oC\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwith  O2pp  =  0.06  mbar  was  optimized  for  growth  conditions  to  obtain  a  single-phase\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrhombohedral BiFeO3 film (see Figs. S1, S2, and 1). These observations align with a report by\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe estimated the percentage of desired R3c BiFeO3 and secondary phases in the films grown\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nat different temperatures with  O2pp = 0.06 mbar, as presented in Table 1. It was found that the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npercentage of desired R3c BiFeO3 gradually increased from 50.7% to 100% until the temperature\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTS = 575 oC, while the secondary phase Bi2Fe4O9 was formed at low substrate temperatures, TS ≤ 550\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noC.  However,  at  high  substrate  temperatures,  TS  >  575  oC,  the  parasitic  phase  Bi2O3  starts  to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncrystallize along with the prepared R3c BiFeO3. These findings are consistent with the results of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBea et al.18 We also determined the out-of-plane lattice constant and microstrain of these films\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfor comparison, which are listed in Table 1. We observed that the out-of-plane lattice parameter\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntends to slowly increase from 3.898 Å to 3.946 Å with increasing TS. These obtained out-of-plane\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlattice  parameters  of  the  BiFeO3  films  are  consistent  with  the  literature.14  While  the  induced\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmicrostrains in  the films  are  evaluated using the  Williamson-Hall equation,20 𝜀 =\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.8**r== 0.2**\n𝛽ℎ𝑘𝑙\n4 tan 𝜃\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nare  in  the  range  of  0.15%  to  0.37%.  These  observations  are  similar  to  the  results  of  a  BiFeO3\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthick film by Zhu et al.17 Additionally, we noted that films grown at low temperatures TS ≤ 575\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noC exhibit  the preferred  growth  direction along  the plane  (110) through the estimated intensity\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\n(see Table 1), while the films grown at  TS > 575  oC have preferential growth along\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe plane (100). This finding will be further investigated by evaluating the degree of orientation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof the optimized BiFeO3 film grown at TS = 575 oC and O2pp = 0.06 mbar in the following.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe XRD pattern of the BiFeO3 film grown on Si (100) at TS = 575 oC and O2pp = 0.06 mbar\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nis shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the film is polycrystalline with a preferred orientation along\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe  (110)  plane.  All  XRD  peaks  observed  in  this  film  can  be  indexed  to  a  rhombohedral  (R-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndistorted  perovskite  phase)  crystal  structure  (PDF#73-0548).  The  values  of  lattice  constants  a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand c of our film are determined to be 5.31 Å and 14.16 Å, respectively. To quantify the (110)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\norientation, the degree of orientation (α110) is calculated using the formula:14\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWhere  I(hkl)  represents  the  total  intensity  of  all  observed  XRD  peaks  of  the  (hkl)  planes  of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBiFeO2.85. The numerator in the formula includes the intensities of both parallel planes of (110)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand  (210).  The  calculated  degree  of  orientation  (α110)  of  the  BiFeO2.85  film  is  approximately\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe right inset in Fig. 1 shows the SEM image of the BiFeO2.85 film. It reveals that the film’s\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsurface had uniform and densely packed grains with an average grain size of approximately 300\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nnm. By analyzing the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS; Fig. S3), we determined the Bi/Fe\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nratio of the film to be approximately 1:1. Similarly, the oxygen content was found to be around\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n2.85, leading us to identify the composition of the film as BiFeO2.85. This observation indicates\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noxygen  deficiencies  in  the  PLD-grown  BiFeO3  film,  which  will  be  further  examined  using  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncore-level  O  1s  XPS  spectrum  (see  Fig.  8).  To  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  film’s\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmicrostructure, we captured 2D and 3D images (Fig. 2) of the film using the AFM microscope.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis  analysis  confirms  the preferred growth  nature of the film  observed in the XRD data.

Additionally, the surface roughness RRMS of the film is measured to be around 18\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 3 illustrates the zero field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled warming (FC) magnetization\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof the oxygen-deficient BiFeO2.85 film measured at an applied magnetic field of 100 Oe from 2 K\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto 300 K.

         " Investigation of electronic energy levels in a weak ferromagnetic oxygen- deficient BiFeO2.85 thick film using absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies   Ramachandran Balakrishnan,*,a,b Ambesh Dixitc and Mamidanna Sri Ramachandra Raob aPhysics Research Centre, Department of Physics, Sethu Institute Technology, Kariapatti-626111, Tamil Nadu, India. bNano Functional Materials Technology Centre, Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India. cAdvanced Materials and Devices Laboratory, Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Jodhpur 342011, Rajasthan, India *Author for correspondence: ramskovil@gmail.com (BR)   We  grew  a  2  μm-thick  film  of  single-phase  BiFeO3  on  a  Si  (100)  substrate  by  pulsed  laser   deposition with a substrate temperature of 575  oC and an oxygen partial pressure of 0.06 mbar.   X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the film exhibits textured growth along the (110) plane   and possesses a rhombohedral R3c structure. Investigations using scanning electron microscopy   and  atomic  force  microscopy  revealed  an  average  grain  size  of  about  300  nm  and  a  surface   roughness of 18 nm for the film. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis estimated the composition of   to  be  BiFeO2.85.  Temperature-  and  magnetic  field-dependent  magnetization   measurements  demonstrated  weak  ferromagnetic  properties  in  the  BiFeO2.85  film,  with  a  non-   zero  spontaneous  magnetization  at  H  =  0  Oe  across  the  temperature  range  of  2–300  K.   Furthermore, the exchange bias field (HEB) of the film changed from the positive exchange bias   field  (+HEB = +6.45 Oe) at  200 K  to  a negative  field  (-HEB =  -8.12 Oe)  at  100 K,  indicating a   shift in macroscopic magnetism from antiferromagnetic to weak ferromagnetic order below 200   K.  Elemental  analysis  via  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  revealed  that  the  Fe  ions  in  the   BiFeO2.85 film are in a 3+ valence state, and a peak feature at 532.1 eV confirmed the presence of   induced oxygen vacancies. UV-visible-NIR and valence band spectroscopic studies showed that   the direct band-gap energy, and the separation between the valence band maximum and  Fermi   energy  were  approximately  2.27  eV  and  0.9  eV,  respectively,  which  are  red-shifted  when   Keywords:  Multiferroics;  bismuth  ferrite;  magnetic  property,  absorption  coefficient;  x-ray   In the past two decades, new-generation materials such as multiferroics have attracted enormous   interest  among  researchers  in  the  fields  of  science  and  technology.1  Due  to  the  coexistence  of   two or more ferroic orders in multiferroic materials, they have been extensively investigated for   various  magnetoelectric  (ME)  and  spintronic  applications.1-5  These  applications  include  high-   density data storage devices, high-frequency filters, magnetic sensors, transducers, actuators, and   photovoltaics.  Perovskite  bismuth  ferrite  (BiFeO3)  is  one  of  the  many  lead-free  multiferroic   materials  studied  for  ME  applications.2-11  However,  scientists  and  engineers  have  encountered   two major issues: processing temperature and atmosphere during the growth of BiFeO3 films on   In a study by Bea et al.,18 they discovered the occurrence of parasitic phases when growing 70   nm  thick BiFeO3  thin films  on an STO (001) substrate using pulsed laser deposition. At a low   substrate  temperature  (TS  =  520  oC)  or  high  oxygen  partial  pressure  (O2pp  =  0.1  mbar),  the   impurity  phase  Bi2O3  formed  alongside  the  desired  phase  BiFeO3,  while  a  secondary  phase   Fe2O3 formed at high-T (TS = 750 oC) or low O2pp (10-4 mbar). Notably, Bea et al.18 were able to   successfully  grow  epitaxial  pseudo-cubic  BiFeO3  thin  films  under  intermediate  growth   conditions of TS = 520–750 oC and O2pp = 10-4–10-1 mbar. However, the rhombohedral structure   (R-phase) is only thermodynamically stable in thick BiFeO3 films or polycrystalline samples.17   The stable R-phase BiFeO3 films have great potential for practical applications in ferroelectric,   piezoelectric,  and  optoelectronic  devices.  However,  there  is  a  discrepancy  in  the  band-to-band   transition  of  BiFeO3,  whether  it  is  direct  and/or  indirect,  and  its  reported  band-gap  values  in  a   Thus,  in  this  study,  we  grew  a  BiFeO3  thick  film  on  an  n-type  Si  (100)  substrate  under   optimized growth conditions at TS = 575 oC and O2pp = 0.06 mbar using a pulsed laser deposition   technique. The film was then analyzed using X-ray diffraction, UV-visible-NIR spectroscopy, X-   ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and magnetization measurements. Our findings indicate that the   grown  oxygen-deficient  BiFeO2.85  thick  film  is  single-phase  and  polycrystalline  with  a   rhombohedral  crystal  structure,  R3c.  Furthermore,  we  determined  the  direct  band-gap  energy   (Eg), the separation between the valence band and Fermi energy (EV-EF), and Urbach energy (EU)   for the BiFeO2.85 film to be approximately 2.27 eV, 0.9 eV, and 0.38 eV, respectively. Based on   these  parameters,  we  proposed  an  electronic  energy-level  diagram  for  the  BiFeO2.85  film.   Additionally,  we  observed  weak  ferromagnetic  behavior  for  the  BiFeO3  film  within  the   temperature range of 2–300 K. This behavior is attributed to the distortion of FeO6 octahedra in   the film due to the induced oxygen vacancies, which leads to the disruption of a short-range spin   First,  we  prepared  a  Bi-rich  Bi1.1FeO3  pellet  in  disc  form  (12  mm  in  diameter  and  2  mm  in   thickness) using a conventional solid-state reaction. Subsequently, BiFeO3 films were grown on   an  n-type  Si(100)  substrate  at  various  substrate  temperatures  (TS)  and  oxygen  partial  pressures   (O2pp)  using  the  pulsed  laser  deposition  (PLD)  technique.18,19  A  Nd:  YAG-based  pulsed  laser   with  a  fluence  of  2.7  J/cm2,  pulse  width  of  19  ns,  wavelength  of  355  nm,  and  frequency   repetition  of  10  Hz  was  used  to  grow  the  BiFeO3  films  on  Si(100)  substrates.  The  target  and   substrates  were  fixed  in  their  respective  positions  in  the  vacuum  chamber,  which  was  then   evacuated to a base pressure of 5 × 10-6 mbar using rotary and diffusion pumps. The substrates   were  heated  to  temperatures  ranging  from  TS  =  525  oC  to  TS  =  625  oC  with  25  oC  increments   using a heater attached to the substrate holder. Oxygen gas was partially filled in the chamber to   reach a constant O2pp of 0.06 mbar during the growth of BiFeO3 films at the different substrate   temperatures. The growth time for all films was 10 minutes. After growth, the films were in-situ   annealed  at  the  respective  growth  temperature  with  O2pp  of  100  mbar  for  1  hour,  followed  by   cooling to room temperature under the same O2pp. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the   grown films were recorded (with a scan rate of 0.016o) and analyzed using a PANalytical X’Pert   X-ray  diffractometer  with  Cu  Kα  (λ  =  1.5406  Å)  X-ray  line.  The  results  based  on  the  XRD   analysis of all grown films are given in section 3.1. From this analysis, it was apparent that the   optimized  growth  condition  was  TS  =  575  oC  with  O2pp  =  0.06  mbar  to  grow  a  single-phase   The microstructure of the optimized BiFeO3 film grown at TS = 575 oC and O2pp = 0.06 mbar   was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)   at  room  temperature.  Subsequently,  the  film  was  subjected  to  temperature-  and  magnetic  field   (H)-dependent magnetization (M) measurements (M vs. T and M vs. H) using a physical property   measurement system (PPMS from Quantum Design, USA). Following this, the Raman spectrum   of  the  BiFeO3  film  was  obtained  at  room  temperature  in  a  backscattering  geometry  using  a   Horiba-Jobin-Yvon HR8000 Raman spectrometer with a He-Ne laser emitting at a wavelength of   632.8 nm. Lastly, a comprehensive analysis of the optical and elemental properties of the BiFeO3   film at room temperature was conducted using a Cary 5E UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer and   The XRD patterns of all grown films in this study are available in the supplementary information   (refer  to  Figs.  S1  and  S2).  A  semi-log  plot  of  a  phase  diagram  illustrating  the  relationship   between oxygen pressure and growth temperature was plotted to show the formation of different   phases,  including  the  desired  rhombohedral  phase  of  BiFeO3  (left  inset  of  Fig.  1).  It  was   observed that the secondary phase Bi4Fe7O9 was mainly formed along with the desired BiFeO3   phase at a low temperature of TS = 525 oC. Conversely, the film grown at a high temperature of   TS = 625 oC was largely amorphous, although the BiFeO3 phase was still present. The preferred   phase of BiFeO3 was found to be primarily formed at intermediate temperatures, TS = 550–600   oC (Fig. S1). The film grown at TS = 575  oC exhibited better crystalline nature compared to the   films grown at other intermediate temperatures, as indicated by the XRD study (left inset of Fig.   1).  Subsequently,  BiFeO3  films  were  deposited  at  different  O2pp  (6  ×  10-3–3  mbar)  while   maintaining a fixed temperature of TS = 575 oC (Fig. S2). The film grown at a high O2 pressure   of  3  mbar  showed  the  presence  of  parasitic  phases  such  as  Bi2O3  and  Fe2O3,  while  the  film   grown at a low O2 pressure of 6 × 10-3 mbar was predominantly amorphous with low-intensity   peaks of BiFeO3. The XRD analyses of these films revealed that the film grown at TS = 575 oC   with  O2pp  =  0.06  mbar  was  optimized  for  growth  conditions  to  obtain  a  single-phase   rhombohedral BiFeO3 film (see Figs. S1, S2, and 1). These observations align with a report by   We estimated the percentage of desired R3c BiFeO3 and secondary phases in the films grown   at different temperatures with  O2pp = 0.06 mbar, as presented in Table 1. It was found that the   percentage of desired R3c BiFeO3 gradually increased from 50.7% to 100% until the temperature   TS = 575 oC, while the secondary phase Bi2Fe4O9 was formed at low substrate temperatures, TS ≤ 550   oC.  However,  at  high  substrate  temperatures,  TS  >  575  oC,  the  parasitic  phase  Bi2O3  starts  to   crystallize along with the prepared R3c BiFeO3. These findings are consistent with the results of   Bea et al.18 We also determined the out-of-plane lattice constant and microstrain of these films   for comparison, which are listed in Table 1. We observed that the out-of-plane lattice parameter   tends to slowly increase from 3.898 Å to 3.946 Å with increasing TS. These obtained out-of-plane   lattice  parameters  of  the  BiFeO3  films  are  consistent  with  the  literature.14  While  the  induced   microstrains in  the films  are  evaluated using the  Williamson-Hall equation,20 𝜀 =   are  in  the  range  of  0.15%  to  0.37%.  These  observations  are  similar  to  the  results  of  a  BiFeO3   thick film by Zhu et al.17 Additionally, we noted that films grown at low temperatures TS ≤ 575   oC exhibit  the preferred  growth  direction along  the plane  (110) through the estimated intensity   (see Table 1), while the films grown at  TS > 575  oC have preferential growth along   the plane (100). This finding will be further investigated by evaluating the degree of orientation   of the optimized BiFeO3 film grown at TS = 575 oC and O2pp = 0.06 mbar in the following.   The XRD pattern of the BiFeO3 film grown on Si (100) at TS = 575 oC and O2pp = 0.06 mbar   is shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the film is polycrystalline with a preferred orientation along   the  (110)  plane.  All  XRD  peaks  observed  in  this  film  can  be  indexed  to  a  rhombohedral  (R-   distorted  perovskite  phase)  crystal  structure  (PDF#73-0548).  The  values  of  lattice  constants  a   and c of our film are determined to be 5.31 Å and 14.16 Å, respectively. To quantify the (110)   orientation, the degree of orientation (α110) is calculated using the formula:14   Where  I(hkl)  represents  the  total  intensity  of  all  observed  XRD  peaks  of  the  (hkl)  planes  of   BiFeO2.85. The numerator in the formula includes the intensities of both parallel planes of (110)   and  (210).  The  calculated  degree  of  orientation  (α110)  of  the  BiFeO2.85  film  is  approximately   The right inset in Fig. 1 shows the SEM image of the BiFeO2.85 film. It reveals that the film’s   surface had uniform and densely packed grains with an average grain size of approximately 300   nm. By analyzing the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS; Fig. S3), we determined the Bi/Fe   ratio of the film to be approximately 1:1. Similarly, the oxygen content was found to be around   2.85, leading us to identify the composition of the film as BiFeO2.85. This observation indicates   oxygen  deficiencies  in  the  PLD-grown  BiFeO3  film,  which  will  be  further  examined  using  the   core-level  O  1s  XPS  spectrum  (see  Fig.  8).  To  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  film’s   microstructure, we captured 2D and 3D images (Fig. 2) of the film using the AFM microscope.   This  analysis  confirms  the preferred growth  nature of the film  observed in the XRD data. The   average grain size of the BiFeO2.85 film is estimated to be approximately 320 nm, consistent with   the SEM study. Additionally, the surface roughness RRMS of the film is measured to be around 18   Figure 3 illustrates the zero field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled warming (FC) magnetization   of the oxygen-deficient BiFeO2.85 film measured at an applied magnetic field of 100 Oe from 2 K   to 300 K. It is observed that the ZFC and FC magnetization curves of the film split below 253 K   with  a  growing  divergence  between  them  as  the  temperature  decreases.  The  FC  magnetization   shows a steady increase  with  temperature until  5 K, followed by a sharp rise in magnetization   below  that  temperature.  On  the  other  hand,  the  ZFC  magnetization  decreases  gradually  with   decreasing  temperature  until  2  K.  These  observations  suggest  weak  ferromagnetic  behavior  of   the  BiFeO2.85  film  below  room  temperature.18,21,22  This  will  be  further  investigated  using   magnetic isotherms (M vs. H) curves at temperatures of 2, 50, 100, 200, and 300 K, which are   presented in Fig. 4. All measured magnetic isotherms display weak ferromagnetic characteristics,   likely  due  to  strain-induced  modulation  of  the  magnetic  structure  of  the  BiFeO2.85  film,  as  the   induced microstrain in the thick film is found to be about 0.31% (see Table 1). For this film, a   maximum  saturation  magnetization  (Ms)  and  coercive  field  (Hc)  of  approximately  0.07  μB/f.u.   and  206.7  Oe,  respectively  were  observed  at  2  K,  consistent  with  previous  studies  on  BiFeO3   films.18,21,22  These  observations  on  the  BiFeO3  thick  film  are  also  similar  to  its  bulk   Notably,  both  Ms and  Hc  values of the BiFeO2.85 film  are found to  increase with  decreasing   temperature. Figure 5 displays the temperature-dependent coercive field (Hc) and exchange bias   field  (HEB).  These  values  were  determined  using  the  relations: 𝐻𝑐 =   (𝐻𝑐1 + 𝐻𝑐2) and 𝐻𝐸𝐵 =   (𝐻𝑐1 − 𝐻𝑐2).26  We  observed  an  increase  in  Hc  with  decreasing  temperature  for  the  oxygen-   deficient BiFeO2.85 film (Fig. 5 a), which is consistent with the FC magnetization data in Fig. 3.   While  the  exchange  bias  field  slightly  increased  to  HEB  =  +6.45  Oe  at  200  K  compared  to  the   value (HEB = +4.67 Oe) at 300 K (Fig. 5b). Below 200 K, the HEB value was found to change to a   negative bias field (-HEB = -8.12 Oe) at 100 K from the positive field (+HEB) at T ≥ 200 K and   then  it  increases  gradually  with  further  decreasing  temperature.  The  switching  of  HEB  from   positive to negative below 200 K is essentially due to the microstrain-induced modification in the   magnetic  structure  of  the  oxygen-deficient  BiFeO2.85  film.  These  observations  indicate  that  the   spin cycloid in our thick film was only nearly destroyed by the induced microstrain (0.31%) in   the  (110)-textured  oxygen-deficient  BiFeO2.85  film.  Since  the  destruction  of  the  short-range   magnetic ordering in BiFeO3 requires a slightly higher microstrain > 0.5% according to Sando et   To further analyze the magnetic behavior of the oxygen-deficient BiFeO2.85 film, we plotted   the Arrott-Belov-Kouvel (ABK) plots28-30 (M2 vs. H/M, as presented in Fig. 6) based on Weiss   = 2𝑎 + 4𝑏𝑀2 )  for  all  measured  temperatures  using  the  magnetic   isotherms  (see  Fig.  4).  Here,  factors  a  and  b  are  temperature-dependent  coefficients.  We   observed that the ABK plots of the M(H) data at different temperatures exhibit a convex feature   with  positive  slopes.29  Additionally,  our  oxygen-deficient  BiFeO2.85  thick  film  has  a  non-zero   spontaneous magnetization at H = 0 Oe for all measured temperatures (see inset of Fig. 4). These   findings confirm a weak ferromagnetic behavior of the film in the temperature range of 2–300 K   (see  Figs.  3–5),28-30  however  both  ferromagnetic  and  antiferromagnetic  orders  coexist  and   compete with each other in the BiFeO2.85 film. Therefore, the negative bias field was detected for   the inspected film at T < 200 K, while the positive field was observed at T ≥ 200 K (see Fig. 5b).   Figure  7a  displays  the  Raman  spectrum  of  the  BiFeO2.85  film  on  Si  (100)  recorded  at  room   temperature  in  the  wavenumber  range  of  100–600  cm-1.  The  observed  high-intensity  Raman   mode  at  523.5  cm-1  is  attributed  to  the  Si  (100)  substrate.12  Among  the  13  (9E+4A1)  Raman-   active  modes  allowed  by  the  R3c-symmetry  of  BiFeO3,12,31-34  we  observed  11  allowed  Raman   modes (7 E(TO) and  4 A1(TO)). Specifically, the modes near 150, 220, 310, and 555 cm-1 belong   to  A1(TO2),  A1(TO2),  A1(TO3),  and  A1(TO4),  respectively.  The  modes  detected  near  130,  240,   260, 280, 345, 380, and 440 cm-1 correspond to the seven allowed Raman modes such as E(TO2),   E(TO3), E(TO4), E(TO5), E(TO6), E(TO7), and E(TO8), respectively. Additionally, the four LO   modes,  namely  A1(LO1),  A1(LO4),  E(LO2),  and  E(LO8)  modes  were  observed  due  to  the   splitting of transverse and longitudinal phonons (TO-LO) related to the 4 Raman-active modes of   the R3c-symmetry of BiFeO3.31-34 We did not detect the first E(TO1) that usually appear below   100 cm-1,31 mainly due to the limitations of our Raman spectrometer.33 Besides, the last E(TO9)   mode  (which  usually  occurs  near  523  cm-1)35  is  not  detected  due  to  the  high-intensity  Raman   To  evaluate  the  frequency  of  Raman  modes  in  the  BiFeO2.85  film,  we  deconvoluted  the   Raman spectrum of the film below 400 cm-1 using the PeakFit software package, as displayed in   Fig. 7b. The frequencies of six E(TO) modes are approximately 135.5, 239.4, 263.4, 285.3, 345.8,   and  380.3  cm-1  corresponding  to  E(TO2),  E(TO3),  E(TO4),  E(TO5),  E(TO6),  and  E(TO7),   respectively. The frequencies of three A1(TO) modes are 156.5, 218.5, and 307.3 cm-1 which are   related to A1(TO2), A1(TO2), and A1(TO3) modes, respectively. Additionally, the frequencies of   four LO modes, A1(LO1), E(LO2), E(LO5), and E(LO6) due to the LO-TO splitting were detected   at approximately 174.3, 187.7, 328.9, and 363.5 cm-1. These findings are in excellent agreement   with the results of Hlinka et al.35 Here, a goodness-of-fit with the coefficient of determination, R2   =0.998 was  achieved by including  two additional  phonon modes at  120.6 and 199.5  cm-1. The   former  mode  is  usually  detected  in  BiFeO3  polycrystals,34  but  not  in  single  crystals  or  thin   films.31-35 The latter mode at 199.5 cm-1 may be related to an extraordinary mode that occurs due   to the mixing between E(TO) and A1(TO) modes according to the observations of Talkenberger   To  investigate  the  optical  properties  of  the  grown  BiFeO2.85  film,  we  used  the  same  growth   conditions to coat the film on a quartz substrate (refer to Section 2). This allowed us to measure   the reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) of the film simultaneously as a function of wavelength   (λ). By analyzing the reflectance spectrum, R versus λ of the film within the wavelength range of   500–3300 nm (the top inset of Fig. 8), we estimated the thickness (d) of the BiFeO3 film using an   interference interval method with a refractive index of n = 2.5 to be approximately 2 μm based   on the observed fringe patterns in the reflectance spectrum. This finding indicates that our film is   relatively  thick.  We  observed  a  rapid  decrease  in  the  reflectance  below  800  nm,  suggesting   strong  absorption  in  the  range  of  400–800  nm,  covering  the  entire  visible  spectrum.  This   Furthermore, by analyzing the measured R(λ) and T(λ) spectra (refer to the top inset of Fig. 8   and Fig. S4), we evaluated the absorption coefficient (α) as a function of wavelength using the   Subsequently,  we  plotted  (αE)2  (left  y-axis)  and  (αE)1/2  (right  y-axis)  as  a  function  of  incident   photon  energy  (E=hν)  for  the  BiFeO2.85  film,  as  shown  in  Fig.  8.  These  plots  were  created  to   determine if the αE data of the BiFeO2.85 thick film obeys the relation:36-40   𝛼ℎ𝜈 = 𝐴(ℎ𝜈 − 𝐸𝑔)𝑛.   Where  Eg  is  the  optical  band-gap  energy,  A  is  a  constant,  and  parameter  n  is  a  power  factor   indicating whether the band-gap transition is direct (n = 1/2) or indirect (n = 2). The estimated   Tauc  gap  (onset  of  optical  absorption)  for  the  inspected  film  is  approximately  2.18  eV,  which   aligns  with  the  values  (2.11-2.15  eV)  reported  for  the  epitaxial  BiFeO3 films.40,41  Furthermore,   the direct band gap of the BiFeO2.85 thick film is determined to be Eg=2.27 eV through the linear   extrapolation of the (αE)2 value tending to zero. This value is comparable to the reported value   (Eg=2.32 eV) for the BiFeO3 film.42 However, it is much lower when compared with the values   (Eg=2.5–2.8 eV) of the high-crystalline BiFeO3 bulk and thin films.5,40-42 Conversely, the indirect   band  gap  of  the  thick  film  is  calculated  to  be  about  1.93  eV.  This  is  likely  attributed  to  the   influence  of  the  electronic  structure  features  in  the  film  due  to  the  induced  defects  such  as   To  verify  this  observation,  we  plotted  the  graph  of  lnα  versus  E  (bottom  inset  of  Fig.  8)  to   Here,  α0  is  a  constant.  Estimating  the  Urbach  energy  provides  information  about  the  defects   associated  with  the  intermediate  energy  levels  close  to  the  conduction  band  minimum  (CBM)   and/or valence band maximum  (VBM)  of BiFeO3.39 Our evaluation  shows that the  EU value is   approximately 0.38 eV for the BiFeO2.85 thick film, consistent with the energy level of shallow   oxygen vacancy states (0.3 eV) rather than deep trap levels (≥ 0.6 eV) due to the presence of Fe2+   ions  in  BiFeO3.44-46  Importantly,  this  EU  value  is  similar  to  the  energy  difference  (0.34  eV)   between the direct and indirect band gap energies of our film. Therefore, the observed indirect   band  transition  is  mainly  due  to  the  presence  of  oxygen  vacancies  and  other  defects  in  our   BiFeO2.85 film. This will be further analyzed using the core-level XPS spectra of the Fe 2p and O   1s peaks of the BiFeO2.85 film along with its valence band spectrum (refer to section 3.5).   The XPS survey scan of the BiFeO2.85 thick film in the energy range of 0–1050 eV is presented   in  Fig.  9. The XPS survey spectrum of the film  was recorded  using  an  Al  Kα x-ray line (with   1486  eV)  at  room  temperature,  using  a  concentric  hemispherical  energy  analyzer  with  pass   energy of 50 eV. This measurement was conducted after cleaning the film’s surface with a 3 keV   argon ion (Ar+) gun sputtering to remove surface contamination as the film was exposed to air   during  handling  for  characterization.  More  details  about  the  XPS  measurements  were  reported   elsewhere.46  Additionally,  the  binding  energies  of  the  core-level  XPS  peaks  of  the  constituent   ions,  Bi3+,  Fe3+,  and  O2-  of  the  sample  were  calculated  after  calibrating  their  spectra  using  a   standard of the surface carbon feature C 1s at 284.6 eV (see Fig. S5).   Here, the characteristic peaks of Bi 4f7/2 (157.8 eV), Bi 4f5/2 (163.2 eV), Fe 2p3/2 (719.8 eV),   Fe 2p1/2 (723.6 eV), and O 1s (529.6 eV) from the constituent ions were detected in the BiFeO2.85   film.  Additionally,  the  features  of  Bi  5d  (25.6  eV),  Fe  3p  (55.6  eV),  Fe  3s  (92.6  eV),  Bi  5p   (118.6 eV), Bi 4d (440.6 & 464.6 eV), and Bi 4p (679.6 & 804.6 eV) were observed for our film.   Notably, the energy difference (ΔE) between Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 is found to be about 5.4 eV (See   inset of Fig.8). These findings are consistent with literature data.47-49 Furthermore, X-ray-induced   Auger electron features; particularly Fe L3M45M45, Fe L3M23M45, Fe LM23M23, and O KLL were   Figure 10 displays the fitted narrow-scan O 1s XPS spectrum of the probed film after Shirley-   type background subtraction. A good fit is achieved using three components at 529.6, 530.9, and   532.1  eV.  The  first  two  components  are  attributed  to  the  metal-oxygen  (M-Ox)  bonds,   specifically the Fe-O and Bi-O bonds, which align with our previous results on bulk BiFeO3.47   The  third  component,  at  532.1  eV,  is  typically  linked  to  oxygen  vacancy  defects  caused  by   dangling bonds in the BiFeO3 material.49 Notably, the contribution of the Bi-O bond (37.5%) to   the  O  1s  peak  is  lower  compared  to  the  contribution  of  the  Fe-O  bond  (46.8%),  likely  due  to   Ar+-ion  sputtering-induced  metal  Bi  into  the  film  (see  Fig.  S6).  This  results  in  the  dominant   behavior of the Fe-O bond over the Bi-O bond;  in  line with  our findings on single-phase bulk   BiFeO3.47  Our  estimation  indicates  that  the  oxygen  vacancies  in  the  film  are  approximately   15.7%. Overall, the ratio between lattice oxygen (OL) and oxygen vacancy (OV) is estimated to   be approximately 0.19 for our film. These observations are consistent with our EDS analysis.   The recorded narrow-scan Fe 2p spectrum of the BiFeO2.85 thick film in the range of 705–740   eV is presented in Fig. 11a. Two features belonging to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 were observed   near 710 and 724 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the ΔE value between the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2   peaks is about 14 eV, indicating that the Fe ions in the film are Fe3+ ions.47,50 Additionally, two   satellite  peaks  related  to  these  two  characteristic  peaks  were  detected  near  718  and  732  eV,   respectively. However, no distinct feature near 709 eV, which is usually related to Fe2+ 2p3/2 was   observed  for  our  sample.  Therefore,  we  conclude  that  the  Fe  ions  in  the  inspected  film  are   present  as  Fe3+  valence  states.  The  fitting  was  performed  using  symmetrical  or  asymmetrical   Gaussian-Lorentzian (GL) product function with the help of the RBD’s AugarScan 3.2 software,   which is described in detail in our earlier work.47 This fitting helped us deduce the characteristic   line widths and shapes of the Fe 2p core-level spectrum for the sample.   Figure  11b  displays  the  GL  function  fitted  curve  of  the  Shirley-type  background  subtracted   Fe3+  2p3/2  peak  of  the  thick  film.  This  non-linear  fit  included  seven  features:  a  pre-peak,  four-   allowed Gupta and Sen (GS) multiplets of Fe3+ 2p3/2, a surface peak, and a satellite peak of Fe3+   2p3/2.  The  individual  curves  of  the  resultant  fit  and  seven  sub-peaks,  along  with  the  measured   data  are  shown  in  Fig.  11b.  The  obtained  binding  energy  (BE)  and  line  width  (w)  of  the  sub-   peaks  of  the  BiFeO2.85  thick  film,  along  with  their  ΔE  values,  are  presented  in  Table  2.  For   comparison,  the  data  of  the  compounds  (from  Refs.  47  and  50),  namely  bulk  BiFeO3,   Bi0.9Ba0.1FeO2.95, Bi0.9Ba0.05Ca0.05FeO2.95, and γ-Fe2O3, are also listed in Table 2. The estimated   BE  and  w  values  of  four  GS  multiplets,  along  with  other  sub-peaks  of  our  film,  are  in  good   In  particular,  the  w  values  (1.3–1.5)  of  our  film  are  comparable  to  those  of  bulk  BiFeO3   materials (1.2–1.7).47 Furthermore, the combined line width (8.4 eV) of the four GS multiplets of   Fe3+  2p3/2  peaks  in  the  presently  inspected  non-stoichiometric  BiFeO2.85  film  is  lower  (9.5  eV)   when compared with its bulk stoichiometric counter-part, BiFeO3.47 However, it is comparable to   that of the oxygen-deficient bulk Bi0.9Ba0.1FeO2.95 (8.8 eV).47 Additionally, the intensity (116) of   its satellite feature is also similar (111) to the bulk Bi0.9Ba0.1FeO2.95. Moreover, we found that the   ΔE value between the Fe3+ 2p3/2 peak of our film and its satellite feature is slightly lower (7.8 eV)   when  compared  with  the  stoichiometric  BiFeO3  ceramic  (8.1  eV)  and  γ-Fe2O3  (8.3  eV).47,50   However,  this  value  is  comparable  to  the  value  (7.7  eV)  of  the  non-stoichiometric  compound,   Bi0.9Ba0.05Ca0.05FeO2.95.47  These  observations  validate  the  oxygen  deficiency  detected  in  the   PLD-grown  BiFeO3  thick  film.  Thus,  we  evaluated  the  average  ligand  electronegativity  of   oxygen (O) to be about 3.26, which is smaller than that of other listed materials (see Table 2).47,50   We included the high-BE surface peak and low-BE pre-peak in the non-linear fitting of the Fe3+   2p3/2  spectrum  of  the  studied  film  to  obtain  reliable  physical  parameters.  These  low-intensity   high-  and  low-BE  peaks  in  the  core-level  Fe  2p  spectrum  usually  occur  due  to  the  Ar+-ion   The experimental valence band spectrum of the BiFeO2.85 film is shown in Fig. 12. The broad   peak  observed  at  5.4  eV  is  primarily  due  to  the  t2g  and  eg  states  resulting  from  a  strong   hybridization  of  the  Fe  3d-O  2p  states,  along  with  contributions  from  Bi  6p  states.51,52  These   contributions  are  from  both  p-d  and  d-d  charge  transfer  transitions  in  the  FeO6  octahedra  of   BiFeO3. This finding is in excellent agreement with the findings of R-phase BiFeO3.47,51-53 It was   observed that the valence band maximum, EV of the film is situated 0.9±0.1 eV below the Fermi   energy  EF,  which  is  lower  than  that  of  the  stoichiometric  BiFeO3  thin  film  (1.2  eV).54  This  is   essentially due to the presence of oxygen vacancies in our film (refer to Fig. 10), which introduce   defect  energy  level  at  EU  =  0.38  eV  below  EC  and/or  above  EV.  This  disorder  energy  level   (Urbach tail) may exist as a narrow electronic band within the band gap of the BiFeO3.55   3.6 An electronic band structure of the PLD-grown oxygen-deficient BiFeO2.85 thick film   Based on the current investigation, an energy level diagram is proposed and presented in Fig. 13   for  the  PLD-grown  oxygen-deficient  BiFeO2.85  thick  film  based  on  the  separation  energy  (EV-   EF),  band-gap  energy  (Eg),  Tauc  gap,  and  Urbach  energy  (EU)  obtained  from  experimental   absorption  and  valence  band  spectra  (see  Figs.  8  and  12).  It  was  observed  that  all  core  level   spectra of the constituents, Bi, Fe, and O were affected by the induced oxygen vacancies, likely   introducing acceptor levels above the VBM. Therefore, significant alterations in binding energy,   full width at half maximum (FWHM, w), and the separation between spin-orbit splitting peaks in   the  Fe  2p  spectrum  were  observed  for  the  oxygen-deficient  BiFeO2.85  film  when  compared  to   bulk  BiFeO3  (refer  to  Table  2).  Particularly,  we  attribute  the  Fermi  energy  shift  towards  the   VBM of the BiFeO2.85 film to the electronic shifts rather than chemical shifts (which only lead to   a change in the oxidation state and binding energy of the elements).56 Hence, band-gap energy,   the  separation  (EV-EF)  energy,  and  all  core-level  spectra  of  the  constituents  were  considerably   altered due to electronic shifts induced by oxygen vacancies in the BiFeO2.85 film (refer to Figs.   8–12 and Table 2). As a result, the combined line width (8.4 eV) of four GS Fe3+ 2p3/2 peaks and   the separation energy (ΔE) between the Fe3+ 2p3/2 peak and its satellite peak were comparable to   (see Table 2).47 Consequently, the oxygen vacancies-induced global electronic shift of the core-   level  of  the  constituent  atoms  in  the  BiFeO2.85  thick  film  was  detected,  which  led  to  excellent   absorption properties (i.e., weak reflectance behavior) in the  range  from 200 to 800 nm, making   it  a  promising  material  for  optoelectronic  applications  such  as  photovoltaic  or  photodetector   The  study  investigated  the  structural,  magnetic,  and  optical  properties  of  an  oxygen-deficient   BiFeO2.85 thick film grown on a Si (100) substrate using pulsed laser deposition under optimized   growth  conditions.  The  substrate  temperature  was  set  at  TS  =  575  oC  and  the  oxygen  partial   pressure at O2pp = 0.06 mbar to obtain a single-phase film. Structural analysis using XRD, EDS,   and  AFM  studies  revealed  that  the  BiFeO2.85  film  grew  as  a  rhombohedral  (110)-textured  film   with  an  average  grain  size  of  300  nm  and  a  roughness  of  18  nm.  In  the  magnetic  studies,  the   BiFeO2.85 thick film shows weak ferromagnetic behavior between 2 and 300 K, with a non-zero   spontaneous  magnetization  at  H  =  0  Oe.  This  is  most  likely  because  the  induced  oxygen   vacancies alter the magnetic structure of the BiFeO2.85 film. With UV-visible-NIR spectroscopic   analysis, the direct band-gap energy and Urbach energy for the examined film were calculated to   be  Eg  =  2.27  eV  and  EU  =  0.38  eV,  respectively.  Oxygen  vacancy  defects  were  found  in  the   recorded  O  1s  XPS  spectrum,  which  are  primarily  responsible  for  the  created  intermediate   energy level, EU. Core-level Fe 2p XPS analysis revealed that the constituent Fe ions are present   only  in  the  Fe3+  valence  state.  The  Fermi  energy  is  situated  at  0.9  eV  above  the  valence  band   maximum of the BiFeO2.85 film, which red-shifted in comparison to its bulk counterpart because   of  the  electronic  shifts  caused  by  the  induced  oxygen  vacancies.  An  electronic  energy-level   diagram is finally suggested for the examined oxygen-deficient BiFeO2.85 thick film.

         "Abstract Purpose This work describes a single institution experience of commissioning a real‐time target tracking and beam control system, known as comprehensive motion management, for a 1.5 T Elekta MR‐Linac. Methods Anatomical tracking and radiation beam control were tested using the MRI4D Quasar motion phantom. Multiple respiratory breathing traces were modeled across a range of realistic regular and irregular breathing patterns ranging between 10 and 18 breaths per minute. Each of the breathing traces was used to characterize the anatomical position monitoring (APM) accuracy, and beam latency, and to quantify the dosimetric impact of both parameters during a respiratory‐gated delivery using EBT3 film dosimetry. Additional commissioning tasks were performed to verify the dosimetric constancy during beam gating and to expand our existing quality assurance program. Results It was determined that APM correctly predicted the 3D position of a dynamically moving tracking target to within 1.5 mm for 95% of the imaging frames with no deviation exceeding 2 mm. Among the breathing traces investigated, the mean latency ranged between −21.7 and 7.9 ms with 95% of all observed latencies within 188.3 ms. No discernable differences were observed in the relative profiles or cumulative output for a gated beam relative to an ungated beam with minimal dosimetric impact observed due to system latency. Measured dose profiles for all gated scenarios retained a gamma pass rate of 97% or higher for a 3%/2 mm criteria relative to a theoretical gated dose profile without latency or tracking inaccuracies. Conclusion MRI‐guided target tracking and automated beam delivery control were successfully commissioned for the Elekta Unity MR‐Linac. These gating features were shown to be highly accurate with an effectively small beam latency for a range of regular and irregular respiratory breathing traces.",

         "Lead‐free perovskites are non‐toxic solution‐processed semiconductors that promise applications in solar cells, light‐emitting diodes, and advanced photodetectors with broad and easily tunable spectral sensitivity. However, understanding excitonic properties and growth conditions are key for the development of efficient and stable materials. This study explores the temperature‐dependent photoluminescence (PL) and the influence of anti‐solvent on crystal size in methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9), a prototypical bismuth‐based lead‐free perovskite. Using a one‐step spin‐coating method, low‐dimensional hexagonal MA3Bi2I9 crystals with controllable grain sizes ranging from 1.4 to 36 μm are developed, employing chlorobenzene as an anti‐solvent. Temperature‐dependent micro‐PL measurements reveal multi‐component PL emissions below 199 K and interestingly, below 144 K, bound excitonic recombination dominates the PL spectra. The observed free and bound exciton recombination peaks are consistent with the MA3Bi2I9 exciton binding energy of ≈340 meV reported in earlier studies. Observed temperature‐dependent PL spectra provide deeper insights into the excitonic properties of MA3Bi2I9, which have strong correlation with optoelectronic device performance, thereby providing a quick tool to assess as‐synthesized lead‐free perovskite films for defect‐site density and binding energy. Furthermore, the potential of concentration‐dependent anti‐solvent engineering in obtaining controllable bismuth perovskite crystal grain sizes for optoelectronic applications is underscored.",

         "Magnetron sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin films are widely used as protective coatings due to their high hardness, but suffer from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting their applicability. The multilayering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) interlayers in the form of bi-layer and tri-layer systems have been studied using microcantilever fracture tests. Plastic dissipation in the Ti layer is shown to lead to an increase in crack growth resistance. The effect of the elastic-plastic mismatch between the two materials on the crack driving force, as well as the size of the fully developed plastic zone in Ti have been quantified in this work for the first time. It is shown that incorporating a Ti layer thickness of 250 nm can improve the fracture resistance by nearly ten times compared to the initiation fracture toughness in TiN, preventing catastrophic fracture of these multi-layered films. These results will aid in physics informed design of optimised thickness of metallic interlayers in multi-layered thin films.",

Even though\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTiN possesses high compressive strengths, the material is inherently brittle and has low fracture\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntoughness.  The  high  degree  of  internal  stresses  and  thermal  mismatch  makes  it  difficult  to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nproduce monolithic TiN films with good adhesion to the substrate beyond a certain thickness\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n[5]. Combining the TiN coating with a metallic titanium (Ti) layer further has been shown to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimprove the durability of the multilayered architectures by enhancing its fracture resistance [6–\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nMetal-ceramic  nanolaminates  are  shown  to  have  high  hardness  and  strength  as  the  layer\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthickness  is  reduced.

In  comparison  to  the  monolithic  TiN  coatings,  Ti-TiN  multilayers\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nexhibit good impact resistance as the Ti layer was shown to dissipate part of the energy through\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nplastic deformation [19].  The increase in thickness of the Ti layer reduces the residual stresses\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin the Ti-TiN architecture [5] and improves the adhesion between the layers, but the increase\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin volume fraction of Ti layer lowers the overall hardness of the multilayers [20,21]. Tailoring\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe Ti layer thickness is therefore essential to using the multilayer in actual applications.

Fracture toughness (KIC)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nvalues of sputtered TiN monolayers are reported to lie in the range of 1.2 – 3.0 MPa.m0.5, which\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfail  in  a  linear  elastic  brittle  manner  [28–33].  In  a  specific  magnetron  sputtered  film,  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\naddition of ductile Ti layer was shown to provide toughening, increasing the fracture toughness\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto 3.2 MPa.m0.5 for a 50 layer Ti-TiN multilayer, almost double that of monolayer TiN films\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhich showed a fracture toughness of 1.4 MPa.m0.5 [11].

The elastic-plastic mismatch between the Ti and TiN\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlayers was quantified in terms of changes in crack driving force, which was accounted for in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntheir  modified  stress  intensity  factor  solutions  [11].  In  addition,  the  compressive  residual\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstresses (up to 8 GPa) which developed due to the layering may also have imparted additional\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntoughening, which could not be separately discerned. However, while the sputtered Ti layer\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nindependently  showed  some  degree  of  crack  tip  plasticity  and  non-linear  deformation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbehaviour, it did not exhibit any expression of plasticity when sandwiched between TiN in the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmultilayer architectures.

In the Ti-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTiN case, the distance between the initial notch and the Ti/TiN interface is too small for a well\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndeveloped plastic zone to form in the Ti layer. This truncation of the plastic zone leads to an\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nalmost  brittle,  catastrophic  fracture  of  the  same.

For Ti-TiN-Ti try-layer as well, although\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe plastic zone in the top Ti layer is truncated due to the TiN layer ahead of it, the bottom Ti\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlayer is free to deform plastically and expand its process zone. Therefore, for the TiN-Ti and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTi-TiN-Ti  architectures,  the  plastic  zone  formation  in  the  Ti  layer  led  to  crack  arrest  and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntoughening, preventing complete fracture of the beam (Fig. 4c and 4d).

The current\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstudy focusses on the effect of crack tip plasticity on the fracture behaviour of the multilayer\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\narchitecture relative to the positon of notch tip and its proximity to the interface.

The\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nextent of elastic shielding is expected to be 12 % in terms of the crack tip driving force (Ktip)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n[49]. The hardness difference between the TiN and Ti introduces a plastic mismatch (\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nas well. When the crack approaches the interlayer from the plastically stronger material, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncrack tip driving force is amplified as the plastic zone spreads across the interlayer  [50,51],\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nleading to an anti-shielding effect. The extent of this effect depends on plastic zone size and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe proximity of the crack to the interface, which governs the relative expansion of the process\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nzone in the plastically soft layer. A rigid layer ahead of the crack constrains the plastic zone\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand truncates it, while a soft layer would allow for expansion of the plastic zone. In the present\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstudy, there is both elastic and plastic mismatch between Ti and TiN, leading to a reinforcement\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof shielding or anti-shielding effects. In order to quantify this, the J-integral calculations were\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ncarried out to determine the deviation in crack tip driving force (Jtip) from the JR.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe Jtip curve as a function of the cantilever displacement is shown in Fig. 6a.  For a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfixed displacement of 1 μm, the TiN-Ti has a higher Jtip compared to the Ti-TiN architecture,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhile the trilayer Ti-TiN-Ti has the lowest crack driving force. Specifically, the longer crack\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin the TiN-Ti experiences a higher crack driving force than the shorter crack, while the longer\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncrack  in  the  Ti-TiN  experiences  a  lower  crack  driving  force  than  the  shorter  crack.  This\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconfirms the anti-shielding effect (an attractive force towards the crack due to the elastically\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand plastically compliant Ti layer) in the TiN-Ti system, and a shielding effect (a repulsive\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nforce  towards  the  crack  due  to  the  elastcially  and  plastically  stiff  TiN  layer)  in  the  Ti-TiN\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsystem. The trilayer experiencing the lowest crack driving force amongst all has more to do\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwith  the  larger  specimen  dimensions  reducing  the  overall  crack  driving  force  for  the  same\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndisplacement. Such changes in crack driving force as the crack approaches an elastically stiffer\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nor compliant layer ahead of it has been well documented in the literature [48,52]. However, in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe present study, it is seen that the fracture resistance of the Ti-TiN architecture (2.7 ± 0.7\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nMPa.m0.5) with the crack in the Ti layer is still very similar to the fracture resistance of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmonolithic Ti layer (3.0 ± 0.4 MPa.m0.5) [11]. Similarly, the fracture resistance of the TiN-Ti\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\narchitecture  (1.6  ±  0.4  MPa.m0.5)  with  the  crack  in  the  TiN  layer  is  nearly  the  same  as  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfracture resistance of monolithic TiN (1.5 ± 0.2 MPa.m0.5) [11]. This is very different from the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresults  obtained  in  bilayer  BaTiO3/SrTiO3  as  well  as  bilayer  BaTiO3/Pt-Si  systems,  where\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nproximity  to  the  interface  resulted  in  a  discernible  increase  in  the  fracture  resistance  of  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsystem in the presence of a stiffer layer [52].

The plastic zone size is found to be of the order of 256 nm in the TiN-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTi bilayer and 277 nm in the Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer Fig. 6b, measured at their respective critical\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndisplacements, when the crack reaches that interface. This represents a fully developed plastic\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nzone since there the layer thickness is at least 5 times the plastic zone size, with the free-surface\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nnot  causing  any  truncation.  In  addition,  the  plasticity  due  to  the  compressive  stresses\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndeveloping  on  the  bottom  side  of  the  beam  (Fig.  6c),  leads  to  additional  toughening  and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npreventing further crack growth in the bilayer TiN-Ti and the trilayer Ti-TiN-Ti (Fig. 6b). Such\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndirect evidence of crack tip plasticity and large scale yielding in metallic Ti thin films has been\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreported for the first time in this study.   When the Ti layer is  reduced in thickness so as to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntruncate its plastic zone to less than 250 nm, such an R-curve behavior is not observed anymore\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n[11]. In fact in such cases, the Ti film is expected to behave like a brittle material, rather than\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nas a ductile metal. When the plastic zone at the crack tip is not allowed to expand due to the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconstraint in size or an interface with a hard layer ahead of it, it is uncommon to see plasticity\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nTo summarise, on comparing the fracture resistance parameters of bilayer Ti-TiN and TiN-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTi architectures (Table 1), the crack located in the Ti layer (for Ti-TiN) shows higher initiation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresistance  compared to the case of crack in TiN layer (for TiN-Ti). This is expected given that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe KIC of single layer Ti is almost double that of the TiN layer [11].  In comparison to single\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlayer Ti, KIC of Ti-TiN is 10% lower, reinforcing that the elastic shielding effect of the TiN\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlayer ahead of the crack tip plays an insignificant role, while truncation of crack tip plasticity\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin fact reduces the initiation KIC of the bilayer. In fact a stiffer layer resists the expansion of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nplastic zone in the Ti layer from fully reaching its stable size. On the other hand, the  KIC of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTiN-Ti is ~7% higher than the single layer TiN, since a softer Ti ahead of the crack tip allows\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfor relaxing the stress intensification in the TiN. The KIC of the trilayer 16% higher than that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof the monolithic Ti, since the the truncation of the plastic zone by the TiN is countered by the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncrack tip plasticity in the third Ti layer. In case of the trilayer, the initial crack experiences a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nshielding effect  due to  the TiN layer ahead of it, and as the crack propagates to  the TiN/Ti\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninterface, it experiences toughening due to the crack tip plasticity in the Ti layer. Therefore,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe trilayer is able to synergistically blend the advantages of elastic and plastic shielding to give\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe highest toughening. This is schematically represented already in Fig. 5a. The quantification\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof the R-curve in such base architectures of two layer and three layer systems will help in the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndesign  of  multilayers  and  graded  architectures  with  improved  fracture  resistance,  without\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresorting to trial and error. Graded multilayers with a harder surface and a tougher interior can\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbe designed based on this study, so as to leverage the advantage of resisting crack growth as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe fracture behaviour of bilayered and trilayered Ti-TiN multilayered film architectures were\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstudied  using  microcantilever  fracture  tests  to  understand  the  fundamental  crack  growth\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmechanics and mechanisms in metal-ceramic based thin films. The initiation fracture toughness\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nvalues of 2.7 ± 0.7 MPa.m0.5 and 1.6 ± 0.4 MPa.m0.5 were found for Ti-TiN and TiN-Ti layers,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsimilar  to  KIC  of  monolithic  Ti  and  TiN  respectively.  More  importantly,  it  was  shown  that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nincluding a Ti layer ahead of the crack tip leads to a rising fracture resistance, with the plastic\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndissipation in the Ti layer preventing catastrophic fracture, in TiN-Ti bilayer and Ti-TiN-Ti\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntrilayer architectures, unlike in the case of Ti-TiN bilayer. These results show that the position\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof  the  crack  tip  and  its  proximity  to  the  interface,  as  well  as  the  type  of  layer  ahead  of  it\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndetermines  the  fracture  behaviour  of  multi-layered  thin  films.  In  elastic-bilayers  such  as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nceramic/ceramic  multilayers,  the  shielding  effect  of  the  stiffer  layer  improves  the  fracture\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresistance by imposing crack closure forces at the crack tip. Unlike this, these results show that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe elastic shielding ahead of the crack tip plays an antagonistic role by suppressing crack tip\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nplasticity, and hence reducing  the initiation toughness  of metal-ceramic  multilayers. On the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nother  hand,  plastic  dissipation  in  the  layer  ahead  of  the  crack  tip  improves  propagation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresistance  by  expanding  the  process  zone.

         " The effect of elastic-plastic mismatch and interface proximity on the fracture toughness of Ti-TiN thin films   Nidhin  George  Mathews1,a,  Aloshious  Lambai1,  Marcus  Hans2,  Jochen  M.  Schneider2, Gaurav Mohanty1 , Balila Nagamani Jaya3,a   1  Materials  Science  and  Environmental  Engineering,  Faculty  of  Engineering  and  Natural Sciences, Tampere University, Tampere 33014, Finland   3  Department  of  Metallurgical  Engineering  and  Materials  Science,  Indian  Institute  of Technology Bombay, Mumbai 400076, India   Magnetron sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin films are widely used as protective coatings   due  to  their  high  hardness,  but  suffer  from  inherent  brittleness  and  low  fracture  toughness,   limiting  their  applicability.  The  multilayering  of  TiN  films  with  metallic  titanium  (Ti)   interlayers in the form of bi-layer and tri-layer systems have been studied using microcantilever   fracture tests. Plastic dissipation in the Ti layer is shown to lead to an increase in crack growth   resistance. The effect of the elastic-plastic mismatch between the two materials on the crack   driving force, as well as the size of the fully developed plastic zone in Ti have been quantified   in this work for the first time. It is shown that incorporating a Ti layer thickness of 250 nm can   improve the fracture resistance by nearly ten times compared to the initiation fracture toughness   in TiN, preventing catastrophic fracture of these multi-layered films. These results will aid in   physics informed design of optimised thickness  of metallic interlayers in multi-layered thin   Keywords:  Titanium  nitride,  Multilayer  thin  films,  Fracture  toughness,  Microcantilever   Titanium  nitride  (TiN)  provides  excellent  hardness,  mechanical  strength,  wear  resistance,   corrosion  resistance  and  chemical  stability  which  find  applications  in  harsh  or  extreme   environmental conditions. It has been used extensively as a hard coating material for different   applications  in  cutting  tool  manufacturing,    energy  applications,  aerospace  and  automotive   parts, and microelectromechanical devices [1–4]. These applications demand the coatings to   sustain high mechanical stresses without compromising their structural integrity. Even though   TiN possesses high compressive strengths, the material is inherently brittle and has low fracture   toughness.  The  high  degree  of  internal  stresses  and  thermal  mismatch  makes  it  difficult  to   produce monolithic TiN films with good adhesion to the substrate beyond a certain thickness   [5]. Combining the TiN coating with a metallic titanium (Ti) layer further has been shown to   improve the durability of the multilayered architectures by enhancing its fracture resistance [6–   Metal-ceramic  nanolaminates  are  shown  to  have  high  hardness  and  strength  as  the  layer   thickness  is  reduced.  In  extremely  thin  nanolaminates  of  metal-ceramic  architectures,  the   ceramic layer co-deforms with the metallic layer due to crossing of dislocations [12,13]. The   Ti-TiN  multilayered  architectures  are  fabricated  in  order  to  have  composite  mechanical   properties of high hardness, strength and toughness. Tailoring the layer thickness of the Ti-TiN   multilayer architecture changes the residual stress state, along with bringing an elastic-plastic   mismatch  across  the  interface,  which  in  turn  contributes  to  the  improvement  in  mechanical   properties such as hardness (H), elastic modulus (E), and fracture toughness (KIC) of layered   architectures  [7,14–19].  In  comparison  to  the  monolithic  TiN  coatings,  Ti-TiN  multilayers   exhibit good impact resistance as the Ti layer was shown to dissipate part of the energy through   plastic deformation [19].  The increase in thickness of the Ti layer reduces the residual stresses   in the Ti-TiN architecture [5] and improves the adhesion between the layers, but the increase   in volume fraction of Ti layer lowers the overall hardness of the multilayers [20,21]. Tailoring   the Ti layer thickness is therefore essential to using the multilayer in actual applications.  The   reduction in the period thickness of Ti/TiN film and therefore increased number of interfaces   for the same volume fraction were shown to improves the hardness and wear resistance of the   films  [22,23].  Interestingly,  the  control  of  interface  structure  can  induce  plasticity  in  the   ceramic layer, which in turn improves the wear resistance. The typical sharp interface in Ti-   TiN was modified into gradient interfaces using nitrogen compositional variation, which lead   Several previous studies have been carried out to determine the fracture behaviour of Ti-   improvement  in  the  fracture  resistance  of  the  architecture  with  the  increase  in  the  layer   thickness and thickness ratio of the Ti (ductile) layer with respect to the TiN (brittle) layer,   consequently with a drop in hardness. But these tests do not provide any insights into the nature   of the fracture, since the fracture path under a complex tri-axial stress state of an indenter is   unknown. Notched microcantilever bending has been widely used to study the crack growth   behaviour of free-standing and multilayered films, as one can determine the contribution of   individual layers and interfaces towards crack propagation [25–27]. Fracture toughness (KIC)   values of sputtered TiN monolayers are reported to lie in the range of 1.2 – 3.0 MPa.m0.5, which   fail  in  a  linear  elastic  brittle  manner  [28–33].  In  a  specific  magnetron  sputtered  film,  the   addition of ductile Ti layer was shown to provide toughening, increasing the fracture toughness   to 3.2 MPa.m0.5 for a 50 layer Ti-TiN multilayer, almost double that of monolayer TiN films   which showed a fracture toughness of 1.4 MPa.m0.5 [11]. Crack growth under mode I loading   conditions  was  found  to  be  straight,  cutting  across  the  layers,  following  the  inter-columnar   boundaries of the sputtered films. The Ti/TiN interface was found to be strong and prevented   any crack deflection along the interface. The elastic-plastic mismatch between the Ti and TiN   layers was quantified in terms of changes in crack driving force, which was accounted for in   their  modified  stress  intensity  factor  solutions  [11].  In  addition,  the  compressive  residual   stresses (up to 8 GPa) which developed due to the layering may also have imparted additional   toughening, which could not be separately discerned. However, while the sputtered Ti layer   independently  showed  some  degree  of  crack  tip  plasticity  and  non-linear  deformation   behaviour, it did not exhibit any expression of plasticity when sandwiched between TiN in the   multilayer architectures. The possible reasons for this suppression of crack tip plasticity  are   due to the constraint on both sides of the Ti layer by the harder and stiffer TiN, and the inability   to accommodate plasticity in individual Ti layer due to its low thickness (80 nm). However,   there  was  uncertainty  due  to  the  low  stiffness  of  the  indentation-micromechanical  loading   system,  which  could  have  overloaded  the  microcantilevers,  leading  to  abrupt,  catastrophic   The objective of this study is to address these open questions on the effect of elastic-plastic   mismatch between the layers and its relative position with respect to crack tip on promoting   crack  tip  plasticity  and  prevention  of  catastrophic  fracture  in  these  architectures.  Notched   trilayered  Ti-TiN-Ti,  and   two  bilayered  Ti-TiN  and  TiN-Ti   (micromachined out of the same Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer sputtered films) are the focus of the study.   The  crack  tip  position  is  varied  to  alternately  determine  the  effect  of  an  elastically  and   plastically  stiffer  (TiN)  and  a  compliant  (Ti)  layer  ahead  of  the  interface,  followed  by  the   overall fracture behaviour of the trilayer architecture. The presence of a ductile, softer, metallic   layer  is  expected  to  a)  modify  the  crack  driving  force  due  to  elastic-plastic  shielding/anti-   shielding at the interface, b) crack tip blunting and, c) crack closure due to compressive residual   stresses. Finite element simulations are performed to estimate the crack driving force variation   Multilayer thin film samples of Ti and TiN were synthesised on Si (100) substrate using high   power pulsed magnetron sputtering  in  an industrial-scale CemeCon CC800/9  chamber. The   trilayer film architecture of Ti-TiN-Ti was deposited with Ti (nominal thickness W3 = 1.6 μm)   as  the  first  layer  on  Si,  while  the  subsequent  TiN  and  Ti  layers  were  supposed  to  exhibit   nominal thicknesses of W2 =1.3 μm and W1 = 1.1 μm respectively. Details about the deposition   parameters are described in a previous work [11]. The strucutral characterisation of the trilayer   film  was  performed  using  grazing  incidence  X-ray  diffraction  (GI-XRD)  studies  (Malvern   Panalytical  Emperyon,  United  Kingdom).  XRD  scans  were  performed  on  the  film  at  an   incidence angle of 10º using CuKα radiation of wavelength (λ) 0.154 nm, operated at 40 kV   voltage and 30 mA current. Focussed ion beam (FIB) cross-sectioning was performed on the   Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer architecture to determine individual layer thicknesses. The Ga+ ion current   at 300 pA at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV was selected for the cross-section milling. The   milled region was imaged in ion channeling contrast in a dual beam SEM (Zeiss Crossbeam   540, Germany) using the 50 pA ion current to visualise the layers. The hardness of the trilayer   film was measured to be 8 GPa, using nanoidentation,in our previous study [11], whereas that   of the monolithic Ti and TiN were measured to be 6.3 GPa and 23.7 GPa respepctively. The   elastic modulus of the monolithic Ti and TiN layers were found to be 148.5 GPa and 377.7   Micromechanical  fracture testing  of the thin film samples  was performed using single-edge   notched microcantilever bend tests. Free-standing microcantilevers were fabricated at the edge   of the specimen using FIB milling (Zeiss Crossbeam 540, Germany). Ion currents of 15 nA, 3   nA and 0.3 nA at 30 kV operating voltage were selected for the coarse, intermediate and fine   milling steps respectively. The front and back sides of the cantilevers were fine polished at an   additional tilt angle of ±1.5º to maintain uniform rectangular cross-section of the beam. The   geometrical dimensions of the cantilever, length (L): thickness (W): width (B) were maintained   at constant ratio of 4.5: 1: 1 for all cases. Notches were milled at a distance (x/W) ~ 2 μm from   the fixed end of the cantilever using 10 pA milling current. Notch depth to width ratio (a/W)   was maintained in the range 0.25 - 0.3 in all test cases with the notch positioned entirely in the   top  layer.  These  geometrical  dimensions  and  the  loading  position  were  considered  so  as  to   maintain a dominant mode I loading conditions for fracture in the cantilevers [34]. Fig. 1a -   Fig.  1c  shows  the  images  of  microcantilevers  of  each  film-substrate  condition:  a)  Ti-TiN   bilayer (W1-2 = 2.4 μm) with the notch in the Ti layer, b) TiN-Ti bilayer (W2-3 = 2.4 μm) with   the notch in the TiN layer and c) Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer (W1-3 = 3.7 μm) with the notch in the Ti   layer. The layer which is mentioned first is on the top surface of the cantilever. It should be   reiterated that the bilayer TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN cantilevers were prepared from the trilayer film   by FIB milling the top and bottom layers respectively. In case of the crack lying in the Ti layer,   or in close proximity to it, a plastic zone size (ry) of ~300 nm was estimated using the Irwin process zone model, according to Eq. 1, considering 𝐾𝐼𝐶 = 3 MPa.m0.5 and 𝜎𝑦 = 2.1 GPa, where   𝜎𝑦 is the nominal yield strength in bending, derived from microcantilever bend tests [11]. The   estimated plastic zone size is ~10 times lower than the cantilever dimensions (B, W) ensuring   The  microcantilever  fracture  tests  were  performed  using  an  in  situ  displacement   controlled nanoindenter (Alemnis AG, Switzerland) inside a SEM (Zeiss Leo 1450, Germany).   A diamond wedge indenter tip (Synton MDP, Switzerland) of 10 μm length and 100º opening   angle was used for loading the cantilevers, to ensure line contact and prevent indentation based   deformation [35]. Fracture experiments were conducted in displacement control mode with tip   travel  speed  of  50  nm/s.  In  such  displacement-controlled  tests,  crack  propagation  results  in   distinct load drops. The displacement values recorded during the tests were then corrected for   the  machine  compliance  to  get  the  actual  displacement  of  the  cantilever.  At  least  three   microcantilevers were tested for each condition.  Initiation fracture toughness (KIC) of the tested   films based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) was calculated from the critical load   (𝑃𝑐)  i.e. maximum  load  at  which  crack  initiation  occurs,  using Eq.  2 [25]  and Eq.  3  [34],   assuming linear elastic behaviour until then. Note: The value of W in the subsequent equations   can take the corresponding values of W1-2, W2-3 and W1-3 depending on the architecture selected.

(Note: The initial notch was always positioned within the top layer). d) Schematic showing the measurement of crack tip opening angle for crack length ‘a’ at instant ‘i’.   To quantify the fracture behaviour in the non-linear elastic-plastic regime of fracture   (i.e.  post  the  first  load  drop),  crack  tip  opening  angle  (CTOA)  was  used  as  the  fracture   resistance parameter of material.  CTOA is defined as the included angle between two faces of   the opening crack surfaces measured with crack tip as the vertex (as shown in Fig. 1d) [36].   The  overall  fracture  resistance  ( 𝐽𝑅)  is  also  evaluated  considering  the  total  area  under  load-   displacement curve using Eq. 4 [37], according to elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM).   where, 𝐴𝑡𝑜𝑡,𝑖 is the total area under the load-displacement curve at instant i (or more specifically   the total  work done during the event),  𝜂  is  a  shape factor equal  to  2 for cantilevers, and  𝑎𝑖   The procedure to determine KIC according to LEFM assumes a homogeneous material system,   which is not strictly the case here. Hence, the crack driving force at the crack tip (Jtip) developed   during the microcantilever fracture experiments were estimated from finite element simulations   using a two-dimensional  model in  ABAQUS  CAE  (Dassault  Systemes  Simulia Corp.). The   material  properties  of the layers were  assumed to  be isotropic and homogeneous within the   layers, with  TiN (E = 377.7 GPa , σy= 7.9 GPa [11]), and Ti (E = 148.5 GPa, σy = 2.1 GPa   [11]). Strain hardening in the Ti layer was incorporated using the  Ramberg-Osgood plasticity   model [38]. The interface was assumed to be sharp and adherent. The material properties used   for  Ti  and  TiN  layers  in  the  model  have  been  reported  in  a  previous  study  [11].  Boundary   conditions  of  the  cantilever  were  chosen  such  that  the  beams  were  encastered  at  one  end   without translations or rotations, while the other end was free to move in vertical direction. A   wedge-shaped  indenter  was  used  to  apply  loads  to  the  cantilever  end.  Surface-to-surface   interaction  was  maintained  with  the  outer  surface  of  the  indenter  tip  and  the  top  surface  of   cantilever to ensure proper contact while loading. A stationary (non-propagating) crack was   defined  as  a  seam  inside  the  cantilever.  The  simulations  were  performed  for  the  following   cases: i) Ti-TiN bilayer, ii) TiN-Ti bilayer, iii) Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer, as shown in Fig. 2a – Fig.   2c. The notch depth was maintained such that two crack lengths were explored for each case,   wherein the crack driving force at initiation, and the shielding/anti-shielding effects as the crack   approaches the interface are both estimated.  For the bilayer cantilevers, a/W of 0.3 (crack away   from the interface) and 0.5 (crack near the interface) was selected, whereas these ratios were   0.3 and 0.65 for the trilayer cantilever. The interface is nearly at half of the total film thickness   for  bilayer  whereas  the  interface  is  at  2/3rd  of  the  thickness  for  the  trilayer  case.  The  crack   driving forces were estimated using the contour integral approach with refined meshes near the   crack tip (Fig. 2d) as recommended by Treml et al. [39].   Fig. 2: Finite element model of a) Ti-TiN bilayer, b) TiN-Ti bilayer, and c) Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer architecture used for simulations with corresponding a/W ratios. d) Finite element mesh using near the crack tip to estimate the crack driving force.   The GI-XRD pattern of the trilayer Ti-TiN-Ti thin film sample is shown in Fig. 3a. The XRD   pattern confirms the hexagonal phase of Ti and cubic phase of TiN from corresponding peak   positions, and shows the polycrystalline nature of the layers. The peaks of TiN are lower in   intensity and exhibit a larger full width at half maximum due to the smaller grains compared   to the Ti layers. The ion channeling contrast image of the film cross-section as shown in Fig.   3b reveals the columnar growth pattern of the films and its nanocrystalline grain structure. A   sharp and well adhered interface is visible with each individual layer of thickess of ~1.6 μm   (Ti layer on Si substrate), ~1.3 μm (TiN layer on Ti) and ~1.1 μm (Ti layer on TiN). Crystallite   sizes of approximately 29 nm for Ti and 5 nm for TiN films were estimated using the Scherrer   formula [40], from the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (002) peak.   Fig.  3:  a)  Grazing  incidence  XRD  pattern  showing  the  phases  of  Ti  (hexagonal)  and  TiN (cubic), and polycrystalline nature of films. b) Ion channelling image showing grain contrast of Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer film architecture.   The representative load-displacement curves and corresponding post-fracture images   of the Ti-TiN bilayer, TiN-Ti bilayer and Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer microcantilever fracture tests are   shown in Fig. 4. All bilayer and trilayer architectures showed an initial linear elastic response   followed by a sharp load drop which corresponds to the crack propagation at the initial notch   (Fig. 4a). The peak load was found to be the highest for the Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer, while for Ti-   TiN and TiN-Ti bilayers the peak loads reached to less than 50% of the trilayer peak load.  In   the case of bilayer Ti-TiN, a complete brittle fracture of the whole system occurred as the crack   propagated catastrophically across the brittle TiN layer without any crack arrest (Fig. 4b). In   contrast to this, for the bilayer TiN-Ti architecture, the crack growth was arrested at TiN/Ti   interface as the crack encountered a ductile Ti layer ahead (Fig. 4c). The load-displacement   curve  did  not  show  a  load  drop  to  zero,  unlike  in  the  Ti-TiN  case.  Instead,  a  partial  load   shedding was followed by an increasingly non-linear deformation of the cantilever, due to the   plastic zone expansion in the Ti layer. Both bilayer architectures showed a similar slope in the   initial elastic loading part as the combined stiffness remains the same in both configurations.   This  is  different  in  case  of  Ti-TiN-Ti  trilayer  configuration,  which  showed  a  higher  slope.   Considering the overall width of the specimen being larger in this case, this is expected. Post   the large load drop at the first peak load, during which the crack propagates across the Ti/TiN   interface and past the TiN layer to reach the next TiN/Ti interface, the load rises again due to   Fig. 4: a) Representative load-displacement curves showing the fracture behaviour of different thin film architectures during the microcantilever fracture experiments. Post fracture images of the microcantilevers showing b) brittle failure in Ti-TiN bilayer, crack arrest in c) TiN-Ti bilayer, and d) Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer architecture.   To summarise, in the Ti-TiN bilayer the crack propagates catastrophically in to the TiN   layer in a linear elastic manner leading to complete fracture of the beam, whereas in the TiN-   Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures, the crack  propagates rapidly up to the TiN/Ti interface during   the  first  load  drop,  post  which  the  plastic  zone  in  the  Ti  layer  prevents  it  from  further   propagation, leading to gradual crack growth. Since the initial crack growth occurs post linear   elastic  deformation,  LEFM  criterion  can  be  used  to  determine  the  fracture  toughness.  The   initiation KIC obtained in terms of LEFM based calculations using Eq. 2 and Eq. 3, for each   architecture  is  listed  in  Table  1.  Average  KIC  of  2.7  ±  0.7  MPa.m0.5  for  Ti-TiN,  1.6  ±  0.4   MPa.m0.5 for TiN-Ti, and 3.2 ± 1.0 MPa.m0.5 for Ti-TiN-Ti was estimated. The initiation KIC   values of Ti-TiN and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures are comparable to the reported KIC values of the   individual Ti film (3.0 ± 0.4 MPa.m0.5) [11], as the crack lay in the Ti layer in these cases,   while that of the TiN-Ti architecture was closer to the individual TiN film (1.5 – 2.0 MPa.m0.5)   [41,30,11,42].    Other  values  of  KIC  have  also  been  reported  for  TiN  (between  2.3  –  2.8   MPa.m0.5)  [28–33,42–44].  The  possible  causes  of  variation  in  the  KIC  value  can  be  the   difference in processing parameters, internal microstructure of the film, thickness of the film   and in some cases, type of fracture testing method used [45,46]. However, for the sputtered   film  tested  here,  the  fracture  toughness  of  free-standing  TiN  tested  using  the  same   microcantilever bend technique was found to be 1.52 ± 0.4 MPa.m0.5 [11].   For the bi-layer TiN-Ti and the tri-layer Ti-TiN-Ti, the pronounced plasticity in the Ti   layer after initial crack growth forces an elastic-plastic fracture mechanics based evaluation of   fracture  resistance  using  the  J-integral  approach.  The  iterative  method  of  determining  the   plasticity  contribution  of  J-integral  solution  using  the  unloading  stiffness  for  each  crack   increment (as mentioned in [37]) is not used here as the system is not homogeneous, and shows   abrupt,  discrete  load  drops  (Fig.  4a).  The  fracture  resistance  was    determined  using  Eq.  4   considering the area until the first load drop for initiation toughness (Jc) and the total area for   overall fracture resistance (JR), and is listed in Table 1. The initiation Jc values for Ti-TiN and   TiN-Ti  architectures are found to be 44 N/m and 23 N/m respectively. The initiation Jc for the   trilayer  is  determined  to  be  52  N/m.  This  Jc  follows  the  same  trend  as  a  KIC,  which  is  as   expected given the linear elastic regime of deformation at this stage. Further crack growth was   quantified  in  terms  of  fracture  resistance  JR.  The  Ti-TiN  does  not  show  any  crack  growth   resistance at all, with catastrophic fracture ensuing post initiation. The pronounced plasticity at   the crack tip near the Ti layer improves the JR in TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti, which were estimated   to be 353 ± 3 N/m and 498 ± 33 N/m respectively. Corresponding CTOA was found to be 18º   and 19º respectively, indicating that JR is a better measure to differentiate the fracture resistance   between the two architectures than CTOA. This work is the first to show the contribution of   plasticity in Ti to the overall fracture resistance as well as the first such attempt to quantify the   fracture  resistance  of  Ti-TiN  multilayers  using  the  elastic-plastic  fracture  mechanics   parameters. This approach can be utilized in the future to estimate the fracture resistance of   Table 1: Summary of the fracture resistance parameters obtained for each film   architecture from microcantilever fracture tests.   Average initial crack length (μm)   Crack tip opening angle, CTOA (º)   Film architecture   Ti-TiN with crack in Ti TiN-Ti with crack in TiN Ti-TiN-Ti with crack in Ti   Fig. 5a is a schematic representing the fracture mechanism in the three cases. In the Ti-   TiN case, the distance between the initial notch and the Ti/TiN interface is too small for a well   developed plastic zone to form in the Ti layer. This truncation of the plastic zone leads to an   almost  brittle,  catastrophic  fracture  of  the  same.  The  post-fracture  images  of  the  Ti-TiN   cantilever surface shown in Fig. 4b confirms the brittle fracture, as the crack propagated along   the intercolumnar boundaries of the films of both Ti and TiN layers without any hinderance.   For the TiN-Ti case, as soon as the crack reaches the interface, the plasticity in the Ti layer   prevents further crack growth and the expansion of the process zone is not hindered, except   upon reaching the free surface at the bottom (Fig 5a). For Ti-TiN-Ti try-layer as well, although   the plastic zone in the top Ti layer is truncated due to the TiN layer ahead of it, the bottom Ti   layer is free to deform plastically and expand its process zone. Therefore, for the TiN-Ti and   Ti-TiN-Ti  architectures,  the  plastic  zone  formation  in  the  Ti  layer  led  to  crack  arrest  and   toughening, preventing complete fracture of the beam (Fig. 4c and 4d).  There is clear evidence   of  such  a  plastic  deformation  zone  and  generation  of  nanocracks  in  the  Ti  layer  in  both   architectures (Fig. 5b and 5c). This shows that plasticity in the Ti layer can indeed be leveraged   Fig. 5: a) Schematic showing the plastic zone development in Ti layer and the crack growth and crack arrest in each layer.

Both high hardness and fracture resistance is necessary for hard protective coatings for   their  improved  performance.  While  hardness  variations  have  been  well  documented  in  the   literature  as  a  function  of  layer  thickness  and  volume  fraction,  factors  that  control  fracture   resistance in metal-ceramic multilayers have not yet been clarified in the literature. The current   study focusses on the effect of crack tip plasticity on the fracture behaviour of the multilayer   architecture relative to the positon of notch tip and its proximity to the interface. It also explores   whether the plastic mismatch controls the fracture resistance compared to the elastic mismatch   in the case of Ti-TiN. The elastic modulus difference between the high stiffness TiN and low   ~ 2.5) and modifies the crack driving force due   to shielding/anti-shielding effect as the crack approaches the respective interfaces [47,48]. The   extent of elastic shielding is expected to be 12 % in terms of the crack tip driving force (Ktip)   [49]. The hardness difference between the TiN and Ti introduces a plastic mismatch (   as well. When the crack approaches the interlayer from the plastically stronger material, the   crack tip driving force is amplified as the plastic zone spreads across the interlayer  [50,51],   leading to an anti-shielding effect. The extent of this effect depends on plastic zone size and   the proximity of the crack to the interface, which governs the relative expansion of the process   zone in the plastically soft layer. A rigid layer ahead of the crack constrains the plastic zone   and truncates it, while a soft layer would allow for expansion of the plastic zone. In the present   study, there is both elastic and plastic mismatch between Ti and TiN, leading to a reinforcement   of shielding or anti-shielding effects. In order to quantify this, the J-integral calculations were   carried out to determine the deviation in crack tip driving force (Jtip) from the JR.   The Jtip curve as a function of the cantilever displacement is shown in Fig. 6a.  For a   fixed displacement of 1 μm, the TiN-Ti has a higher Jtip compared to the Ti-TiN architecture,   while the trilayer Ti-TiN-Ti has the lowest crack driving force. Specifically, the longer crack   in the TiN-Ti experiences a higher crack driving force than the shorter crack, while the longer   crack  in  the  Ti-TiN  experiences  a  lower  crack  driving  force  than  the  shorter  crack.  This   confirms the anti-shielding effect (an attractive force towards the crack due to the elastically   and plastically compliant Ti layer) in the TiN-Ti system, and a shielding effect (a repulsive   force  towards  the  crack  due  to  the  elastcially  and  plastically  stiff  TiN  layer)  in  the  Ti-TiN   system. The trilayer experiencing the lowest crack driving force amongst all has more to do   with  the  larger  specimen  dimensions  reducing  the  overall  crack  driving  force  for  the  same   displacement. Such changes in crack driving force as the crack approaches an elastically stiffer   or compliant layer ahead of it has been well documented in the literature [48,52]. However, in   the present study, it is seen that the fracture resistance of the Ti-TiN architecture (2.7 ± 0.7   MPa.m0.5) with the crack in the Ti layer is still very similar to the fracture resistance of the   monolithic Ti layer (3.0 ± 0.4 MPa.m0.5) [11]. Similarly, the fracture resistance of the TiN-Ti   architecture  (1.6  ±  0.4  MPa.m0.5)  with  the  crack  in  the  TiN  layer  is  nearly  the  same  as  the   fracture resistance of monolithic TiN (1.5 ± 0.2 MPa.m0.5) [11]. This is very different from the   results  obtained  in  bilayer  BaTiO3/SrTiO3  as  well  as  bilayer  BaTiO3/Pt-Si  systems,  where   proximity  to  the  interface  resulted  in  a  discernible  increase  in  the  fracture  resistance  of  the   system in the presence of a stiffer layer [52]. Since no such effect of the second layer is seen   on the initiation fracture toughness of the Ti-TiN and TiN-Ti systems, the origin of the fracture   resistance in these systems is further looked into from the point of view of plasticity in the Ti   layer. Only one such study on the effect of yielding and hardening of a metallic layer on the   fracture resistance of metal-ceramic films has been reported to the best of our knowledge on   Fig. 6: a) Crack driving force as a function of cantilever displacement in Ti-TiN, TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures from finite element simulations assuming stationary, non-propagating cracks. b) Plastic zone evolution near the crack tip (in red circles) inside the Ti layer (shown as plastic strain equivalent - PEEQ) when the crack meets the TiN/Ti interface at the respective critical  displacements,  and  c)  maximum  principal  stresses  (Max.PS)  contours  in  Ti-TiN bilayer,  TiN-Ti  bilayer  and  Ti-TiN-Ti  trilayer  architecture  at  the  respective  critical displacements.   In both bilayer configurations, the crack once initiated, extends rapidly towards the second   layer until it encounters the interface, upon which the fracture behaviour diverges for the two   cases. Further crack propagation depends on the ductile or brittle nature of the next layer ahead.   The R-curve in the bilayer TiN-Ti and the trilayer Ti-TiN-Ti is made possible due to a fully   developed plastic zone in the Ti layer once the crack reaches the TiN/Ti interface, whereas in   case of Ti-TiN system, no plastic zone is formed in the TiN layer when the crack reaches the   interface (Fig. 6b). Plastic zone formation in TiN is nearly impossible given that TiN is almost   4 times as strong as Ti. The plastic zone size is found to be of the order of 256 nm in the TiN-   Ti bilayer and 277 nm in the Ti-TiN-Ti trilayer Fig. 6b, measured at their respective critical   displacements, when the crack reaches that interface. This represents a fully developed plastic   zone since there the layer thickness is at least 5 times the plastic zone size, with the free-surface   not  causing  any  truncation.  In  addition,  the  plasticity  due  to  the  compressive  stresses   developing  on  the  bottom  side  of  the  beam  (Fig.  6c),  leads  to  additional  toughening  and   preventing further crack growth in the bilayer TiN-Ti and the trilayer Ti-TiN-Ti (Fig. 6b). Such   direct evidence of crack tip plasticity and large scale yielding in metallic Ti thin films has been   reported for the first time in this study.   When the Ti layer is  reduced in thickness so as to   truncate its plastic zone to less than 250 nm, such an R-curve behavior is not observed anymore   [11]. In fact in such cases, the Ti film is expected to behave like a brittle material, rather than   as a ductile metal. When the plastic zone at the crack tip is not allowed to expand due to the   constraint in size or an interface with a hard layer ahead of it, it is uncommon to see plasticity   To summarise, on comparing the fracture resistance parameters of bilayer Ti-TiN and TiN-   Ti architectures (Table 1), the crack located in the Ti layer (for Ti-TiN) shows higher initiation   resistance  compared to the case of crack in TiN layer (for TiN-Ti). This is expected given that   the KIC of single layer Ti is almost double that of the TiN layer [11].  In comparison to single   layer Ti, KIC of Ti-TiN is 10% lower, reinforcing that the elastic shielding effect of the TiN   layer ahead of the crack tip plays an insignificant role, while truncation of crack tip plasticity   in fact reduces the initiation KIC of the bilayer. In fact a stiffer layer resists the expansion of the   plastic zone in the Ti layer from fully reaching its stable size. On the other hand, the  KIC of   TiN-Ti is ~7% higher than the single layer TiN, since a softer Ti ahead of the crack tip allows   for relaxing the stress intensification in the TiN. The KIC of the trilayer 16% higher than that   of the monolithic Ti, since the the truncation of the plastic zone by the TiN is countered by the   crack tip plasticity in the third Ti layer. In case of the trilayer, the initial crack experiences a   shielding effect  due to  the TiN layer ahead of it, and as the crack propagates to  the TiN/Ti   interface, it experiences toughening due to the crack tip plasticity in the Ti layer. Therefore,   the trilayer is able to synergistically blend the advantages of elastic and plastic shielding to give   the highest toughening. This is schematically represented already in Fig. 5a. The quantification   of the R-curve in such base architectures of two layer and three layer systems will help in the   design  of  multilayers  and  graded  architectures  with  improved  fracture  resistance,  without   resorting to trial and error. Graded multilayers with a harder surface and a tougher interior can   be designed based on this study, so as to leverage the advantage of resisting crack growth as   The fracture behaviour of bilayered and trilayered Ti-TiN multilayered film architectures were   studied  using  microcantilever  fracture  tests  to  understand  the  fundamental  crack  growth   mechanics and mechanisms in metal-ceramic based thin films. The initiation fracture toughness   values of 2.7 ± 0.7 MPa.m0.5 and 1.6 ± 0.4 MPa.m0.5 were found for Ti-TiN and TiN-Ti layers,   similar  to  KIC  of  monolithic  Ti  and  TiN  respectively.  More  importantly,  it  was  shown  that   including a Ti layer ahead of the crack tip leads to a rising fracture resistance, with the plastic   dissipation in the Ti layer preventing catastrophic fracture, in TiN-Ti bilayer and Ti-TiN-Ti   trilayer architectures, unlike in the case of Ti-TiN bilayer. These results show that the position   of  the  crack  tip  and  its  proximity  to  the  interface,  as  well  as  the  type  of  layer  ahead  of  it   determines  the  fracture  behaviour  of  multi-layered  thin  films.  In  elastic-bilayers  such  as   ceramic/ceramic  multilayers,  the  shielding  effect  of  the  stiffer  layer  improves  the  fracture   resistance by imposing crack closure forces at the crack tip. Unlike this, these results show that   the elastic shielding ahead of the crack tip plays an antagonistic role by suppressing crack tip   plasticity, and hence reducing  the initiation toughness  of metal-ceramic  multilayers. On the   other  hand,  plastic  dissipation  in  the  layer  ahead  of  the  crack  tip  improves  propagation   resistance  by  expanding  the  process  zone.  The  critical  Ti  thickness  needed  for  plastic   dissipation to aid in improved fracture resistance is found to be nearly 250 nm. These insights   will aid in physics informed design of Ti-TiN multilayers with optimum thickness of the metal   interlayer which prevents catastrophic fracture, while maintaining other properties such as high   hardness,  by  leveraging  the  effect  of  elastic-plastic  mismatch  between  the  metal  and  the   Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.

Herein, we report the preparation of a series of\nelectrocatalysts based on octadecyl amine (ODA) coated Cu2O nanoparticles.\nHRTEM images show ODA coatings with thickness from 1.2 to 4 nm. DFT\ncalculations predict that at low surface coverage, ODA tends to lay on the Cu2O\nsurface, leaving hydrophilic regions.

In situ Raman spectroscopy has revealed that the optimum\nODA thickness contributes to the stabilization of key intermediates in the\nformation of C2+ products, especially ethanol. Electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy and pulse voltammetry measurements confirm that the thicker ODA\nshells increase charge transfer resistance, while the lowest ODA content\npromotes faster intermediate desorption rates.

However, one of the main\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbottlenecks that has hindered so far the commercial application of this technology is the lack\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSince Hori’s seminal paper,[2] electrodes based on Cu and derivative compounds have been\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nfound among the most active ones for CO2 conversion into different hydrocarbons and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nalcohols.[3] However, these Cu electrodes still suffer from low product selectivity and/or\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstability,[4] particularly at high current densities, limiting its commercial viability. In the case\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nof Cu electrodes, the lack of product selectivity has been frequently attributed to the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noccurrence of competing side reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nto the moderate binding energy to *CO intermediates.[5] The last parameter is proposed to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nresult in the simultaneous formation of one-carbon (C1) products, such as CO, CH4, or\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHCOOH, together with variable proportions of two (or more)-carbon (C2+) products, such as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCH2=CH2, CH3CH2OH, CH3CH2CH2OH, among others. The formation of liquid C2+ products\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nis generally more desirable than C1 products owing to their higher market price, energy\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ndensity and their physical state at ambient conditions. Therefore, when designing Cu\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nelectrocatalysts for eCO2R, it is essential to enhance the selectivity to the formation of C2+\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nproducts by decreasing the occurrence of HER and the evolution of C1 products.[6]\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTo minimize HER, the initial step of eCO2R, which involves the one-electron and one-proton\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreduction of CO2 to form adsorbed *COOH, must be favored. Theoretical calculations have\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nshown that the ratio of dissolved CO2 to protons ([CO2]/[H+]) at the electrocatalyst/electrolyte\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninterface significantly influences this reaction step.[7] Hence, to enhance selectivity toward\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\neCO2R over HER, it is advantageous to employ electrocatalysts with hydrophobic surface,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhich contribute to maintain a high ([CO2]/[H+]) ratio. On the other hand, since C2+ product\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nformation rate is proportional to the concentration of reactive C1 intermediates, such as *CO,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n*CHO, and *CH2, a high surface coverage of reactive C1 intermediates is highly beneficial\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nGreat progress at improving the selectivity of Cu-based electrocatalysts for eCO2R has been\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nachieved using alloys,[9] tuning the particle size[10] and morphology,[11] by control of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsurface facets,[12] and doping with heteroatoms,[13] among other reported procedures.[14] More\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrecently, the performance of heterogeneous Cu electrocatalysts has been improved by surface\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimplantation of molecular modifiers that allow stabilization of key reaction intermediates and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ncontrol surface hydrophobicity.[15] For example, Zhang et al have recently reported the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\npreparation of Cu2O modified by cucurbit[6]urils for HER suppression. In this way, an\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nenhancement of the Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards carbon products (CO + HCOOH) from\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n40 %, in the absence of the cucurbit[6]uril molecules, to 94 % in their presence has been\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreported. The authors attributed this enhancement to the strong CO2 adsorption capacity on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe surface and to its higher hydrophobicity, which simultaneously traps CO2 near the Cu2O\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsites and limits H2O interaction.[16] In other example, Lim et al reported the selective C2+\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nproduct formation with a FE of 77 %, on histidine-functionalised Cu2O electrocatalyst,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndecreasing HER FE to 21 %. The authors attributed this eCO2R selectivity to C2+ products to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe interaction of surface intermediates with histidine moieties that favors an increased\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nintermediate population on the catalyst surface.[17] Besides molecular modifiers, Chen, et al.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nreported the coating of Cu electrodes with acrylamide-based polymers containing amino\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngroups. A FE of 90 % towards C2+ products was achieved at – 0.97 V vs. RHE, with only a <\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n7 % of FE towards HER. This high FE towards C2+ products was ascribed to the pendant\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\namino groups in the polymer backbone, which are proposed to lead to a higher concentration\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof CO2 or carbonate species on the electrode surface, affecting also to the surface pH as a side\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn those precedents, no attention has been paid to the influence on how molecular modifiers\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nassemble on the electrodes surface and on the packing effect on the mass and charge transfer\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nkinetics at the electrocatalyst interface. Herein, we have prepared a set of electrocatalysts for\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof octadecyl amine (ODA) on the surface increase the ODA shell thickness around the Cu2O\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNPs, from 1.2 to 4 nm in average, affecting significantly to the eCO2R selectivity, there being\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nan optimal thickness. Our DFT calculations have revealed that the reason for this selectivity\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndependence on ODA shell thickness is the molecule packing and position, laying on the Cu2O\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nperpendicular to the surface and densely packed at high contents. The packing and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\narrangement of ODA on the NP surface have a strong influence on the selectivity towards C2+\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nproducts vs. undesirable competing HER. At the optimum shell thickness (2 nm), a 73 % of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nFE towards C2+ products (CH2=CH2 and CH3CH2OH) and low HER (FE of 8 %) were\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmeasured at -0.9 V vs. RHE. Lower coverage results in enhanced HER due to the inefficiency\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nof the thinner hydrophobic shell, while at larger ODA content, the concentration of key\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nintermediates at the interface is also negatively affected due to impeded charge transfer. In\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsitu Raman spectroscopy experiments confirmed that the concentration of key intermediates\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nfor ethylene and ethanol production is maximized at the optimum ODA thickness. In\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand high concentration of charged species at the optimum thickness, while at larger thickness\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\npromotes electrical insulation of the Cu2O surface, increasing charge transfer resistance.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsamples with the lowest ODA content. However, at the optimum thickness, the rate of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nintermediates desorption is the slowest, favouring the C2+ products formation. Finally, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nactivity of the ODA-functionalized Cu2O electrocatalyst has been evaluated in a flow cell\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsystem. C2+ products such as ethylene, ethanol, propanol and acetic acid have been detected,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nachieving a FE to C2+ of ca. 73% at 300 mA/cm2 current density without apparent\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCu2O NPs coated by different amounts of ODA were prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nfollowing the synthetic procedure described in detail in the experimental section. In brief,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncolloidal Cu2O NPs were in situ formed by chemical reduction of Cu (II) acetylacetonate in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\noctadecene (ODE) at 205 oC in the presence of increasing ODA amounts. ODA is an\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\namphiphilic molecule with a polar amino group head and an apolar C18 alkyl chain. The\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\namino group has a dual function, providing a strong anchoring group to the Cu2O\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nnanoparticles surface, as well as being a reducing agent during the Cu2O nanoparticles\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nformation. Upon anchoring on the Cu2O surface the C18 alkyl chain renders hydrophobic the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nThe successful formation of Cu2O NPs was confirmed by XRD and TEM. PXRD patterns\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\npresented in Figure S1 in supporting information (SI) confirms Cu2O as the only crystal\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nphase present in all the samples. It is worth noticing that the diffraction peaks of the different\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsamples broaden with the ODA content, which would be compatible with an amorphous shell\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ngrowing in thickness with the increase in ODA loading during synthesis. The observed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbroadening is also evidenced by the slight increase in the lattice spacing values of the samples\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwith ODA addition (Table S1 in SI). Figure S2 in SI shows TEM images of the ODA-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfunctionalized Cu2O NPs at different ODA loadings. As can be observed in these images, all\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsamples present similar polyhedric morphology and particle size distribution, with an average\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nThe formation of an amorphous shell coating the Cu2O NPs was confirmed by HRTEM\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(Figure 1). In these images, amorphous layers of different thicknesses can be observed in the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsamples under study. The average thickness of these shells has been calculated after\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmeasurement of a statistically relevant number of samples. In this way, thicknesses of 1.3 ±\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n0.10 nm, 2.0 ± 0.12 nm, 2.7 ± 0.13 nm and 4.0 ± 0.20 nm have been determined for CuODA1,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nFurther confirmation of the ODA-functionalization on the Cu2O nanoparticles surface has\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nbeen obtained by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Figure S3). In all samples under study, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\npresence in the FTIR spectra of vibrational peaks located at 3328 cm-1 attributable to N-H\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbond stretching was observed, together with peaks centred at 2914, 2845 and 719 cm-1 that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncan be assigned to the asymmetric C-H bond stretch, the symmetric C-H stretching vibration,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand the rocking mode, respectively. Moreover, the 1464 cm-1 peaks have been attributed to C-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nH scissoring. Altogether, these FTIR spectra confirm the presence of ODA in all samples. In\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\naddition, vibration peaks at 623 cm-1 in all samples can be assigned to Cu2O, in good\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nagreement with the PXRD data. It is worth noticing that the intensity of the ODA\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncharacteristic vibration peaks increases with the ODA loading. This is in good agreement with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe thickness increase of the amorphous layers observed in the HRTEM images in Figure 1.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nChemical composition analysis of the different samples was carried out by combining ICP-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOES and combustion elemental analysis. The results are summarized in Table S2 in SI. As\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncan be seen there, addition of increasing amounts of ODA during the Cu2O synthesis results\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin an enhancement of the C and N content in the final samples, being in accordance with the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nThe surface chemical composition of the as-prepared ODA-functionalized Cu2O NPs was\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfurther investigated by XPS. Figure 2 shows the high resolution XPS data of Cu 2p 3/2 peaks\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nand the best deconvolution to individual components for all samples. As can be observed,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCuODA1 sample shows a single component centred at 932.68 eV, which can be ascribed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\neither to Cu0 or CuI species. Alternatively, CuODA2, CuODA3 and CuODA4 spectra have\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbeen deconvoluted in two components. In these samples, a component located at 932.7 eV is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nalso assigned either to Cu0 or CuI. The second component, centred at 934.2 eV can be\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nattributed to CuII oxide species. It is worth noticing that CuII crystal phases have not been\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndetected by PXRD (see Figure S1 in SI) and, therefore, the CuII species observed by XPS can\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nonly be attributed to a very thin, passivating layer on the Cu2O NPs surface. In addition, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nrelative contribution of the component assigned to CuII species decrease with the ODA\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncontent, which is compatible with the role of ODA as reducing agent. In order to elucidate the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nactual Cu oxidation state of the first component, either Cuo or CuI, the Auger Cu LMM\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nspectra was also acquired for all samples, the results being presented in Figure S4 in SI.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 2.

Yelow lines correspond to the experimental data fitting, while the blue and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nred lines correspond to the Cu0 and CuI components. Orange and green lines correspond to the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAs can be seen there, while the Cu LMM Auger spectra of CuODA1 and CuODA4 show a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsingle component related to CuI, the CuODA2 spectrum presents two components\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ncorresponding to CuI and CuII, and the CuODA3 sample exhibits in addition a small third\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncomponent attributed to Cuo, besides CuI and CuII. Overall, the as-prepared samples present\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ndifferent chemical environment at the NP surface depending on the ODA content. CuI is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncommon in all samples, in good agreement with XRD results. CuII species are also present in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmost of the samples, especially in CuODA2 and CuODA3, while Cu0 has been only observed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin a small proportion in CuODA3. It should be noted that this surface composition belongs to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe different samples prior the electrocatalytic reactions and, therefore, they could not\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncorrespond with the actual active catalyst form under the electrochemical reaction conditions,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe influence of ODA-coating on the Cu2O NPs surface in the eCO2RR was studied.  For this\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npurpose, glassy carbon electrodes supporting the different CuODA samples were prepared as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ndescribed in detail in the experimental section and used as working electrodes in a H-type\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nelectrochemical cell in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte.

Variable amounts of CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH2CH2 and CH3CH2OH,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntogether with H2, were measured for the different ODA-functionalized Cu2O electrocatalysts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe partial product FE values for each of the samples were determined at different potentials\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nin the range from -0.8 to -1.1 V vs. RHE. The results are presented in Figure 3. For all\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsamples, the formation of carbon products is favoured at the lowest potentials (-0.8 and -0.9 V\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nvs. RHE), while HER becomes predominant at higher potentials.

Figure S8 shows some photographs to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nillustrate the distinctive behaviour of CuODA2 and CuODA2-wash in water. Thus, CuODA2\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nexhibits a remarkable hydrophobicity, which can be visually observed by CuODA2 powder\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfloating in water for 2 h. In contrast, CuODA2-wash underwent instantaneous precipitation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nEvaluation of the electrocatalytic activity of CuODA2-wash revealed that HER efficiency\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nincreases respect to CuODA2 at all the potentials under study (Figure 3 c). Accordingly, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nC2+ FE is significantly reduced at all potentials and, in particular, from 73.3 % to 35.5 at -0.9\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nV vs. RHE, while HER FE is enhanced from 8 to 48.3 %. This result clearly reveals the key\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nrole of ODA suppressing HER and favoring the selectivity towards C2+ products.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCyclic voltammetry of the samples at different scan rates (10 – 80 mV/s, Figure S9 in SI)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nallowed us to determine the active electrochemical surface area (ECSA) by measuring the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndouble-layer capacitance (CDL). As can be observed in Figure S10 in SI, the CDL decreased\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwith the ODA content increase. Therefore, it seems that the Cu atoms at the NP surface\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbecome increasingly screened as the ODA thickness increases. Moreover, in agreement with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthis interpretation for the decrease of ECSA, the overall current density for the different\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCuODA samples also decreases with the ODA content, as depicted in the linear scanning\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nvoltammetry (LSV) plots in Figure S5 in SI.  Thus, there is an optimum ODA thickness for\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe selective production of C2+ products. Figure 3 d presents the relationship between the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\norganic shell thickness measured from the HRTEM images and the C2+ FE as a function of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe added ODA during the sample preparation. The amorphous ODA layer thickness follows\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\na nearly linear relationship with the ODA content present during the CuODA synthesis. In this\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nway, an optimum thickness of ca. 2 nm for C2+ products formation has been determined. An\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nincrease or diminution of the ODA layer thickness in just 0.5 nm, approximately, leads to a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn order to determine the role of the ODA coating on the CO2 adsorption capacity of these\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsamples, the CO2 adsorption isotherms of CuODA2 and CuODA2-wash were measured at 25\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noC, and the results are depicted as Figure S11 in SI. As can be seen there, minor differences\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nin CO2 adsorption have been found, being the CO2 adsorption capacity of CuODA2-wash\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nslightly higher than that of CuODA2. This is indicating that the ODA coatings have not a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsignificant role in the CO2 adsorption, and the observed differences in FE towards C2+\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nIn order to assess the influence of the ODA thickness on the product selectivity, density\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations, in which different amounts of ODA were adsorbed on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe Cu2O surface, were performed. In the models used for these calculations, a coverage of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n17 % (corresponding to 3 ODA molecules adsorbed on our supercell system) leads to a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthickness of 1.80 nm, while doubling the coverage to 33 % increases the thickness up to 2.14\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nnm, in the range of the optimal thickness observed by HRTEM for the selective C2+\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nproduction in CuODA2. At lower ODA coverages, the ODA alkyl chains tend to maximize\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe interaction with the surface, lying flatter on it (see Scheme 2). However, low ODA\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ncoverage (< 17 %) still allows direct contact between the Cu2O surface and the aqueous\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nelectrolyte. This is experimentally evidenced by the higher ECSA obtained in CuODA1 and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCuODA2-wash samples, containing the lowest ODA loadings (Figure S10 in SI). As\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconsequence, incomplete coverage would diminish the surface hydrophobicity of the sample,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmaking easier the occurrence of HER, as depicted in Figure 3 for CuODA1 and CuODA2-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwash samples. On the opposite direction, at higher coverage percentage, the packing of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nODA molecules forces the alkyl chains to align almost perpendicularly to the surface, and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nvery close to each other. However, a much too dense ODA shell affects negatively to the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncharge and mass transfer with the electrolyte. Hence, the FE towards C2+ products obtained at\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe optimum ODA thickness of 2 nm would be a consequence of two opposite effects. An\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nincomplete ODA coverage still allowing the occurrence of HER, while a too dense ODA shell\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nbeing detrimental for the transfer of reagents or products with the surrounding medium as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nScheme 2. Correlation between the ODA coverage and ability of CO2 adsorption on the Cu2O\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsubstrate. At high density, the ODA are vertically aligned and tightly packed, hindering CO2\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nadsorption; at low density the ODA molecules are almost flat on the surface, decreasing the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nability of CO2 to adsorb on the metal. At an optimal coverage, the ODA molecules are tilted\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nConsidering the 33 % coverage as optimal, data from the model being in accordance with the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCuRN2 experimental system, we have performed a series of calculations on the adsorption of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nkey intermediates which can lead to both ethylene and ethanol with this coverage percentage.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nAdsorption on the Cu2O surface at 33 % ODA coverage model was compared with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncalculations on a bare Cu2O surface (Figure 4a). In agreement with recent literature,[20] we\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconsidered the system charged. In particular, we focus on the *CHO and *CH adsorption as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npossible intermediates for C2+ products, as well as one of the key intermediate to distinguish\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nbetween the formation of ethylene (*CCH) or ethanol (*CCHOH). In fact, from the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nprotonation of the carbon atoms in the *CCHOH intermediate, ethanol can be obtained in four\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsteps, while protonation of *CCH should, eventually, lead to ethylene as product.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nOur computational results show that the presence of ODA has a profound effect on the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nadsorption energy of the investigated intermediates, as it stabilizes the adsorption of *CO2,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n*CCHOH and *CCH, while it destabilizes the *CHO and *CH adsorption in different\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ndegrees. The largest change due to the ODA influence is observed for the *CH adsorption\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nenergy, with a destabilization of 2.26 eV going from bare to ODA covered surface, due to the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nformation of a shorter bond in the first, of 0.182 nm, compared to a bond distance of 0.190 m,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nA different impact is observed for the *CCHOH and *CCH adsorption energies, being more\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstable when ODA is present with values of -0.81 and -0.78 eV, respectively, while on the bare\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsurface the adsorption energy is weaker for both systems, with values of -0.46 and -0.62 eV,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrespectively. The weaker stability obtained for *CCHOH on the bare surface can be attributed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto the lack of stabilizing interactions of the OH group in the intermediate with the nitrogen\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\natoms present in the ODA molecules. This, in turn, has a profound impact for the production\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nof either ethylene or ethanol. In fact, we can easily rationalize the experimental FE\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nconsidering the reaction energies of the selected intermediates (Figure 4b). When ODA is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\npresent, the *CHO formation is thermodynamically favourable by -2.32 eV. From this\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nintermediate, two pathways can be followed. The first leads to a double protonation of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncarbonyl oxygen to obtain *CH, which can lead to ethylene after *CO insertion. Yet, *CH is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthermodynamically unstable compared to *CHO, with an energy of -0.22 eV, thus hampering\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nits formation and the subsequent ethylene formation. The second pathway considers the *CO\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninsertion on the *CHO intermediate, leading to *CCHOH, with an energy of -2.03 eV, which\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nis 0.1 eV more stable than the *CCH intermediate. This results in a slightly more favourable\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nethanol formation when ODA is present, through *CCHOH, rather than water elimination to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nA different scenario arises when the bare surface is considered. In this case, *CH has been\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfound more favourable thermodynamically compared to when ODA is present, although its\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nenergy is still higher than that of *CHO, with value of -2.27 eV. Yet, at the applied potential\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof -0.9 V vs. RHE there should be enough energy to overcome this barrier, and reaction can\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncontinue towards the ethylene formation. On the other hand, on bare Cu2O surface *CCH is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmore stable than *CCHOH by 0.1 eV, in a reverse situation than for the ODA covered\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsurface, thus suggesting that now the ethylene path should be more favourable, in good\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 4.

The results are presented as Figure S12 in SI.

A decrease in the ODA content\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndisminishes the ODA coverage on the Cu2O NPs, decreasing the hydrophobicity of the NP\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsurface, and, consequently, favouring HER. On the contrary, a thicker ODA shell could\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nprevent from efficient intermediates stabilization near the electrocatalyst surface, as well as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nforming an electrical insulating layer disfavouring charge and mass transfer from electrolyte\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTo give additional support to our proposal, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwas measured in all samples to disclose differences in the charge transfer properties of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsamples. EIS spectra of the different samples were collected in CO2-saturated 1 M KHCO3\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nelectrolyte across 20 different potentials between -0.2 and -0.8 V vs. RHE in 0.03 V\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nincrements. The results are presented as Figure S13 in SI. As a representative example, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nNyquist plot of CuODA2 acquired at -0.7 V vs. RHE derived from these measurements is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAs can be seen there, this plot is composed of a semicircle at higher frequency together with a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsecond feature at lower frequencies, in good agreement with previously reported related\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nexamples.[17] The experimental data were fitted to a modified Randle’s circuit model (see\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure S14 b), indicating two possible electrochemical interfaces with different time scales.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe obtained charge transfer resistance at the two different time scales (RLF and RHF for the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlow frequency and high frequency domains, respectively) have been compared (Figure 5).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nRHF has been attributed to the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte-electrocatalyst\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ninterface, while RLF is typically assigned to Faradaic reactions that take normally place in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nslower time scale.  As can be seen, the main differences in RLH and RHF take place at low\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npotentials. However, at -0.8 V vs. RHE, both RHF and RLF of all samples tend to converge into\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nvery similar values. This suggests favourable charge transfer during the reaction, in good\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nagreement with previous reports.[17] CuODA4 and CuODA3 showed the highest RLF, while\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand CuODA2 and CuODA2-wash demonstrated the lowest RLF of these measurements. This\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nis not surprising due to the insulating behaviour of ODA, in good agreement with the CDL data\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand the DFT simulations. This is further evidenced by the low FE (60 -80 %) presented for\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCuODA3 and CuODA4 in Figure 3. Due to the insulating effect of the ODA coating in these\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsamples, some charge could be consumed removing adsorbed species from the catalysts\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsurface. Hence, some trace products have not not taken into account in the FE calculation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nFigure 5. RHF, RLF, CPEHF and CPELF values obtained from the best fitting of the Nyquist\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nplots for CuODA1 (black squares), CuODA2 (red circles), CuODA3 (pink inverted triangles),\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCuODA4 (green diamond) and CuODA2-wash (blue triangle) in the potential range from –\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nOn the other hand, the capacitive parameters, represented by the constant-phase elements\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCPEHF and CPELF, showed opposite trends. In the case of CPELF, the capacitance in all\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsamples increased with the negative potential, indicating higher population of charged species\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin close contact with the catalysts surface. On the contrary, the CPEHF diminishes with the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nincrease in cathodic potential, suggesting a lower population of charged species in the double\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nlayer. As can be seen, CuODA2-wash, CuODA1 and CuODA2, with lower ODA content,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\npresented highest density of charged species on the catalyst surface, while CuODA3 and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCuODA4, with the higher ODA thickness, exhibited the lowest population of charged species\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nnear the active sites. All-in-all pointing to the thicker ODA coating results in an increase of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncharge transfer resistance, and a concomitant decrease on the density of charged species on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIt is worth noticing, however, that the EIS measurements have been carried out between -0.2\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand -0.8 V vs. NHE. Measurements with larger potentials, including the optimum -0.9 V vs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nRHE, are not possible due to large fluctuations in the capacitance values as consequence of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe vigorous evolution of gases, which strongly disturb the EIS measurements. To overcome\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthis experimental hurdle, we used pulse voltammetry that allowed us to analyse the charge\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\naccumulation and desorption kinetics on the electrocatalyst surface using short pulses (0.5 s)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfrom an anodic potential of + 0.3 V vs NHE (near OCP) up to a cathodic potential range from\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n-0.7 to -1 V vs. NHE (Figure S15 a in SI), as reported before.[13] The transient current profiles\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof all samples were acquired in this way (see Figure S11 b-f in SI), and fitted to a combination\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.5**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n(𝐶2𝑛𝑑+ 𝑘2𝑛𝑑)2 +   𝐶1𝑠𝑡 · 𝑒(−𝑘1𝑠𝑡·𝑡)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\nEquation 1\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nFrom the experimental data fitting, second-order decay kinetics parameters (C2nd and k2nd)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwere obtained for all samples. C2nd represents the initial current (t=0) and describes the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsurface charge accumulation, while k2nd describes the current decay rate and it is related with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe cumulative desorption rate of species on the catalysts surface. As can be seen in Figure 6,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nC2nd followed identical trend than that obtained from CPEHF in Figure 5, where CuRN2-wash\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nshows the highest initial surface accumulation, followed by CuODA1 and CuODA2, being\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nFigure 6.

It is well known, that the formation C2+ products require multiple electron and proton\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntransfer, and therefore, intermediates should remain adsorbed on the surface catalysts long\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nenough for this multiple charge and proton transfer. Hence, this result could explain the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nenhanced FE for C2+ products demonstrated by CuODA2. In comparison with CuODA1, both\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npresent similar initial charge accumulation, however, the intermediate species desorb faster in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCuODA1 than in CuODA2, explaining the higher selectivity towards C2+ in CuODA2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCuODA3 and CuODA4 have lower initial surface charge than CuODA2, besides slightly\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncharge accumulation, the desorption rate is 5 times faster in CuODA2-wash than in CuODA2,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand therefore, the intermediate species leading to C2+ remain longer time on CuODA2 catalyst\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsurface, promoting the improved FE for C2+ products. Overall, pulsed voltammetry\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ndemonstrated in CuODA2 is the key factor resulting in a more efficient formation of C2+.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nIt is well-known that the information obtained from the H-cell configuration cannot be\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nextrapolated directly into the dynamic environment of a continuous flow electrolyser as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconsequence of the mass transport limitations in H-cell, which limit current densities to values\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlower than 100 mA/cm2, bearing little resemblance with commercial electrolyzers. For these\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreasons, and encouraged by the outstanding selectivity towards C2+ products obtained using\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCuODA2, the FE of this electrocatalyst was also tested under industrially relevant operation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconditions, using a flow cell at the current density range from 100 to 400 mA/cm2. The results\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nare presented in Figure S16 in SI. As can be seen there, FE towards C2+ products increases\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwith the current density up to 300 mA/cm2, being the C2+ FE of 73.5 %, very close to that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nobtained in the H-cell (Figure 3). At larger current density values (400 mA/cm2), the C2+ FE\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndecreased to 60.3 %. Interestingly, CH3COOH and CH3CH2CH2OH, beside CH2=CH2 and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nCH3CH2OH, were detected in the continuous flow conditions.

Moreover, the stability of the ODA layer has been confirmed by HRTEM images,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFITR spectroscopy and combustion elemental analysis of the used electrocatalyst.

The combustion elemental analysis results are summarized in Table S2 in SI. The\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nobtained C and N contents (wt.%) in CuODA2 after the reaction are very similar to those of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe fresh sample. However, a small decrease in C and N can be observed.

         " Unravelling the influence of shell thickness in organic functionalized Cu2O nanoparticles   Chemical and Biological Systems Simulation Lab, Centre of New Technologies, University of   products, remains a critical challenge for its implementation in commercial applications.   Herein, we report the preparation of a series of electrocatalysts based on octadecyl amine   (ODA) coated Cu2O nanoparticles. HRTEM images show ODA coatings with thickness from   1.2 to 4 nm. DFT calculations predict that at low surface coverage, ODA tends to lay on the   Cu2O surface, leaving hydrophilic regions. Oppositely, at high surface coverage, the ODA   molecules are densely packed, being detrimental for both mass and charge transfer. These   changes in ODA molecular arrangement explain differences in product selectivity. In situ   Raman spectroscopy has revealed that the optimum ODA thickness contributes to the   stabilization of key intermediates in the formation of C2+ products, especially ethanol.   the thicker ODA shells increase charge transfer resistance, while the lowest ODA content   promotes faster intermediate desorption rates. At the optimum thickness, the intermediates   desorption rates are the slowest, in agreement with the maximum concentration of   intermediates observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, thereby resulting in a Faradaic   Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) is considered an appealing approach for the   conversion of CO2 emissions into high-value chemical products and fuels, especially in the   periods in which there is a renewable electricity production surplus. However, one of the main   bottlenecks that has hindered so far the commercial application of this technology is the lack   Since Hori’s seminal paper,[2] electrodes based on Cu and derivative compounds have been   found among the most active ones for CO2 conversion into different hydrocarbons and   alcohols.[3] However, these Cu electrodes still suffer from low product selectivity and/or   stability,[4] particularly at high current densities, limiting its commercial viability. In the case   of Cu electrodes, the lack of product selectivity has been frequently attributed to the   occurrence of competing side reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and   to the moderate binding energy to *CO intermediates.[5] The last parameter is proposed to   result in the simultaneous formation of one-carbon (C1) products, such as CO, CH4, or   HCOOH, together with variable proportions of two (or more)-carbon (C2+) products, such as   CH2=CH2, CH3CH2OH, CH3CH2CH2OH, among others. The formation of liquid C2+ products   is generally more desirable than C1 products owing to their higher market price, energy   density and their physical state at ambient conditions. Therefore, when designing Cu   electrocatalysts for eCO2R, it is essential to enhance the selectivity to the formation of C2+   products by decreasing the occurrence of HER and the evolution of C1 products.[6]   To minimize HER, the initial step of eCO2R, which involves the one-electron and one-proton   reduction of CO2 to form adsorbed *COOH, must be favored. Theoretical calculations have   shown that the ratio of dissolved CO2 to protons ([CO2]/[H+]) at the electrocatalyst/electrolyte   interface significantly influences this reaction step.[7] Hence, to enhance selectivity toward   eCO2R over HER, it is advantageous to employ electrocatalysts with hydrophobic surface,   which contribute to maintain a high ([CO2]/[H+]) ratio. On the other hand, since C2+ product   formation rate is proportional to the concentration of reactive C1 intermediates, such as *CO,   *CHO, and *CH2, a high surface coverage of reactive C1 intermediates is highly beneficial   Great progress at improving the selectivity of Cu-based electrocatalysts for eCO2R has been   achieved using alloys,[9] tuning the particle size[10] and morphology,[11] by control of the   surface facets,[12] and doping with heteroatoms,[13] among other reported procedures.[14] More   recently, the performance of heterogeneous Cu electrocatalysts has been improved by surface   implantation of molecular modifiers that allow stabilization of key reaction intermediates and   control surface hydrophobicity.[15] For example, Zhang et al have recently reported the   preparation of Cu2O modified by cucurbit[6]urils for HER suppression. In this way, an   enhancement of the Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards carbon products (CO + HCOOH) from   40 %, in the absence of the cucurbit[6]uril molecules, to 94 % in their presence has been   reported. The authors attributed this enhancement to the strong CO2 adsorption capacity on   the surface and to its higher hydrophobicity, which simultaneously traps CO2 near the Cu2O   sites and limits H2O interaction.[16] In other example, Lim et al reported the selective C2+   product formation with a FE of 77 %, on histidine-functionalised Cu2O electrocatalyst,   decreasing HER FE to 21 %. The authors attributed this eCO2R selectivity to C2+ products to   the interaction of surface intermediates with histidine moieties that favors an increased   intermediate population on the catalyst surface.[17] Besides molecular modifiers, Chen, et al.   reported the coating of Cu electrodes with acrylamide-based polymers containing amino   groups. A FE of 90 % towards C2+ products was achieved at – 0.97 V vs. RHE, with only a <   7 % of FE towards HER. This high FE towards C2+ products was ascribed to the pendant   amino groups in the polymer backbone, which are proposed to lead to a higher concentration   of CO2 or carbonate species on the electrode surface, affecting also to the surface pH as a side   In those precedents, no attention has been paid to the influence on how molecular modifiers   assemble on the electrodes surface and on the packing effect on the mass and charge transfer   kinetics at the electrocatalyst interface. Herein, we have prepared a set of electrocatalysts for   of octadecyl amine (ODA) on the surface increase the ODA shell thickness around the Cu2O   NPs, from 1.2 to 4 nm in average, affecting significantly to the eCO2R selectivity, there being   an optimal thickness. Our DFT calculations have revealed that the reason for this selectivity   dependence on ODA shell thickness is the molecule packing and position, laying on the Cu2O   perpendicular to the surface and densely packed at high contents. The packing and   arrangement of ODA on the NP surface have a strong influence on the selectivity towards C2+   products vs. undesirable competing HER. At the optimum shell thickness (2 nm), a 73 % of   FE towards C2+ products (CH2=CH2 and CH3CH2OH) and low HER (FE of 8 %) were   measured at -0.9 V vs. RHE. Lower coverage results in enhanced HER due to the inefficiency   of the thinner hydrophobic shell, while at larger ODA content, the concentration of key   intermediates at the interface is also negatively affected due to impeded charge transfer. In   situ Raman spectroscopy experiments confirmed that the concentration of key intermediates   for ethylene and ethanol production is maximized at the optimum ODA thickness. In   and high concentration of charged species at the optimum thickness, while at larger thickness   promotes electrical insulation of the Cu2O surface, increasing charge transfer resistance.   samples with the lowest ODA content. However, at the optimum thickness, the rate of   intermediates desorption is the slowest, favouring the C2+ products formation. Finally, the   activity of the ODA-functionalized Cu2O electrocatalyst has been evaluated in a flow cell   system. C2+ products such as ethylene, ethanol, propanol and acetic acid have been detected,   achieving a FE to C2+ of ca. 73% at 300 mA/cm2 current density without apparent   Cu2O NPs coated by different amounts of ODA were prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1,   following the synthetic procedure described in detail in the experimental section. In brief,   colloidal Cu2O NPs were in situ formed by chemical reduction of Cu (II) acetylacetonate in   octadecene (ODE) at 205 oC in the presence of increasing ODA amounts. ODA is an   amphiphilic molecule with a polar amino group head and an apolar C18 alkyl chain. The   amino group has a dual function, providing a strong anchoring group to the Cu2O   nanoparticles surface, as well as being a reducing agent during the Cu2O nanoparticles   formation. Upon anchoring on the Cu2O surface the C18 alkyl chain renders hydrophobic the   The successful formation of Cu2O NPs was confirmed by XRD and TEM. PXRD patterns   presented in Figure S1 in supporting information (SI) confirms Cu2O as the only crystal   phase present in all the samples. It is worth noticing that the diffraction peaks of the different   samples broaden with the ODA content, which would be compatible with an amorphous shell   growing in thickness with the increase in ODA loading during synthesis. The observed   broadening is also evidenced by the slight increase in the lattice spacing values of the samples   with ODA addition (Table S1 in SI). Figure S2 in SI shows TEM images of the ODA-   functionalized Cu2O NPs at different ODA loadings. As can be observed in these images, all   samples present similar polyhedric morphology and particle size distribution, with an average   The formation of an amorphous shell coating the Cu2O NPs was confirmed by HRTEM   (Figure 1). In these images, amorphous layers of different thicknesses can be observed in the   samples under study. The average thickness of these shells has been calculated after   measurement of a statistically relevant number of samples. In this way, thicknesses of 1.3 ±   0.10 nm, 2.0 ± 0.12 nm, 2.7 ± 0.13 nm and 4.0 ± 0.20 nm have been determined for CuODA1,   Further confirmation of the ODA-functionalization on the Cu2O nanoparticles surface has   been obtained by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Figure S3). In all samples under study, the   presence in the FTIR spectra of vibrational peaks located at 3328 cm-1 attributable to N-H   bond stretching was observed, together with peaks centred at 2914, 2845 and 719 cm-1 that   can be assigned to the asymmetric C-H bond stretch, the symmetric C-H stretching vibration,   and the rocking mode, respectively. Moreover, the 1464 cm-1 peaks have been attributed to C-   H scissoring. Altogether, these FTIR spectra confirm the presence of ODA in all samples. In   addition, vibration peaks at 623 cm-1 in all samples can be assigned to Cu2O, in good   agreement with the PXRD data. It is worth noticing that the intensity of the ODA   characteristic vibration peaks increases with the ODA loading. This is in good agreement with   the thickness increase of the amorphous layers observed in the HRTEM images in Figure 1.   Chemical composition analysis of the different samples was carried out by combining ICP-   OES and combustion elemental analysis. The results are summarized in Table S2 in SI. As   can be seen there, addition of increasing amounts of ODA during the Cu2O synthesis results   in an enhancement of the C and N content in the final samples, being in accordance with the   The surface chemical composition of the as-prepared ODA-functionalized Cu2O NPs was   further investigated by XPS. Figure 2 shows the high resolution XPS data of Cu 2p 3/2 peaks   and the best deconvolution to individual components for all samples. As can be observed,   CuODA1 sample shows a single component centred at 932.68 eV, which can be ascribed   either to Cu0 or CuI species. Alternatively, CuODA2, CuODA3 and CuODA4 spectra have   been deconvoluted in two components. In these samples, a component located at 932.7 eV is   also assigned either to Cu0 or CuI. The second component, centred at 934.2 eV can be   attributed to CuII oxide species. It is worth noticing that CuII crystal phases have not been   detected by PXRD (see Figure S1 in SI) and, therefore, the CuII species observed by XPS can   only be attributed to a very thin, passivating layer on the Cu2O NPs surface. In addition, the   relative contribution of the component assigned to CuII species decrease with the ODA   content, which is compatible with the role of ODA as reducing agent. In order to elucidate the   actual Cu oxidation state of the first component, either Cuo or CuI, the Auger Cu LMM   spectra was also acquired for all samples, the results being presented in Figure S4 in SI.   Figure 2. XPS core-level spectra of Cu 2p 3/2 of CuODA1 (a), CuODA2 (b), CuODA3 (c)   and CuODA4 (d). Yelow lines correspond to the experimental data fitting, while the blue and   red lines correspond to the Cu0 and CuI components. Orange and green lines correspond to the   As can be seen there, while the Cu LMM Auger spectra of CuODA1 and CuODA4 show a   single component related to CuI, the CuODA2 spectrum presents two components   corresponding to CuI and CuII, and the CuODA3 sample exhibits in addition a small third   component attributed to Cuo, besides CuI and CuII. Overall, the as-prepared samples present   different chemical environment at the NP surface depending on the ODA content. CuI is   common in all samples, in good agreement with XRD results. CuII species are also present in   most of the samples, especially in CuODA2 and CuODA3, while Cu0 has been only observed   in a small proportion in CuODA3. It should be noted that this surface composition belongs to   the different samples prior the electrocatalytic reactions and, therefore, they could not   correspond with the actual active catalyst form under the electrochemical reaction conditions,   The influence of ODA-coating on the Cu2O NPs surface in the eCO2RR was studied.  For this   purpose, glassy carbon electrodes supporting the different CuODA samples were prepared as   described in detail in the experimental section and used as working electrodes in a H-type   electrochemical cell in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Pt wire and KCl-saturated   Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A Nafion   117® membrane was used to separate the cathodic and anodic compartments.   All CuODA samples were active for eCO2RR (Figure S5 in SI), but exhibiting different   product distribution. Variable amounts of CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH2CH2 and CH3CH2OH,   together with H2, were measured for the different ODA-functionalized Cu2O electrocatalysts.   The partial product FE values for each of the samples were determined at different potentials   in the range from -0.8 to -1.1 V vs. RHE. The results are presented in Figure 3. For all   samples, the formation of carbon products is favoured at the lowest potentials (-0.8 and -0.9 V   vs. RHE), while HER becomes predominant at higher potentials. The maximum selectivity   towards C2+ products (CH2=CH2 and CH3CH2OH) takes place at -0.9 V vs. RHE. Notably, at   this potential, CuODA2 sample was the most selective electrocatalyst for CH2=CH2 and   CH3CH2OH (FE of 17.8 ± 1.5 % and 55.5 ± 5.3 %, respectively), while FE of CO, CH4,   HCOOH and H2 was only of 0.1 ± 0.0 %, 5.4 ± 0.5 %, 10.2 ± 1.2 % and 8.0 ± 0.7 %,   respectively. The improved FE towards C2+ products in CuODA2 is also evidenced by a   higher partial current density towards C2+, as can be observed in Figure 3 b. In order to put   into a broad context the results herein obtained, a literature survey was carried out, and the FE   values of reported precedents are summarized as Table S3 in SI. As it can be there, CuODA2   performs among the best samples, only clearly surpassed by the polyamide incorporated Cu.   Figure 3.

(d) Comparison of the measured ODA thickness average (black line)   and C2+ FE (red line) with the added ODA. Error bars indicate standard deviation.   To understand the role of ODA coating, we submitted CuODA2 sample to a washing   treatment in order to remove the ODA coating from the Cu2O surface (see experimental   section) and, subsequently, the electrocatalytic activity of the washed sample (denoted as   CuODA2-wash) was compared to that of the ODA-coated CuODA2. The successful removal   of ODA from the Cu2O surface was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, ICP-OES and   combustion elemental analysis (see Figure S3 and Table S1 in SI). As can be seen in ATR-   FTIR, a drastic reduction of the characteristic ODA vibration peaks, together with a   significant diminution in the C and N content were determined for CuODA2-wash.   Meanwhile, the XRD pattern presented in Figure S6 in SI shows that sample crystallinity has   not been affected by the washing treatment, being Cu2O the only crystal phase detected. The   polyhedric morphology and particle size is also preserved, as evidenced from the TEM   images presented as Figure S7 in SI. Moreover, we have studied the hydrophilic-hydrophobic   properties of ODA coated Cu2O nanoparticles. Figure S8 shows some photographs to   illustrate the distinctive behaviour of CuODA2 and CuODA2-wash in water. Thus, CuODA2   exhibits a remarkable hydrophobicity, which can be visually observed by CuODA2 powder   floating in water for 2 h. In contrast, CuODA2-wash underwent instantaneous precipitation   Evaluation of the electrocatalytic activity of CuODA2-wash revealed that HER efficiency   increases respect to CuODA2 at all the potentials under study (Figure 3 c). Accordingly, the   C2+ FE is significantly reduced at all potentials and, in particular, from 73.3 % to 35.5 at -0.9   V vs. RHE, while HER FE is enhanced from 8 to 48.3 %. This result clearly reveals the key   role of ODA suppressing HER and favoring the selectivity towards C2+ products.   Cyclic voltammetry of the samples at different scan rates (10 – 80 mV/s, Figure S9 in SI)   allowed us to determine the active electrochemical surface area (ECSA) by measuring the   double-layer capacitance (CDL). As can be observed in Figure S10 in SI, the CDL decreased   with the ODA content increase. Therefore, it seems that the Cu atoms at the NP surface   become increasingly screened as the ODA thickness increases. Moreover, in agreement with   this interpretation for the decrease of ECSA, the overall current density for the different   CuODA samples also decreases with the ODA content, as depicted in the linear scanning   voltammetry (LSV) plots in Figure S5 in SI.  Thus, there is an optimum ODA thickness for   the selective production of C2+ products. Figure 3 d presents the relationship between the   organic shell thickness measured from the HRTEM images and the C2+ FE as a function of   the added ODA during the sample preparation. The amorphous ODA layer thickness follows   a nearly linear relationship with the ODA content present during the CuODA synthesis. In this   way, an optimum thickness of ca. 2 nm for C2+ products formation has been determined. An   increase or diminution of the ODA layer thickness in just 0.5 nm, approximately, leads to a   In order to determine the role of the ODA coating on the CO2 adsorption capacity of these   samples, the CO2 adsorption isotherms of CuODA2 and CuODA2-wash were measured at 25   oC, and the results are depicted as Figure S11 in SI. As can be seen there, minor differences   in CO2 adsorption have been found, being the CO2 adsorption capacity of CuODA2-wash   slightly higher than that of CuODA2. This is indicating that the ODA coatings have not a   significant role in the CO2 adsorption, and the observed differences in FE towards C2+   In order to assess the influence of the ODA thickness on the product selectivity, density   functional theory (DFT) calculations, in which different amounts of ODA were adsorbed on   the Cu2O surface, were performed. In the models used for these calculations, a coverage of   17 % (corresponding to 3 ODA molecules adsorbed on our supercell system) leads to a   thickness of 1.80 nm, while doubling the coverage to 33 % increases the thickness up to 2.14   nm, in the range of the optimal thickness observed by HRTEM for the selective C2+   production in CuODA2. At lower ODA coverages, the ODA alkyl chains tend to maximize   the interaction with the surface, lying flatter on it (see Scheme 2). However, low ODA   coverage (< 17 %) still allows direct contact between the Cu2O surface and the aqueous   electrolyte. This is experimentally evidenced by the higher ECSA obtained in CuODA1 and   CuODA2-wash samples, containing the lowest ODA loadings (Figure S10 in SI). As   consequence, incomplete coverage would diminish the surface hydrophobicity of the sample,   making easier the occurrence of HER, as depicted in Figure 3 for CuODA1 and CuODA2-   wash samples. On the opposite direction, at higher coverage percentage, the packing of the   ODA molecules forces the alkyl chains to align almost perpendicularly to the surface, and   very close to each other. However, a much too dense ODA shell affects negatively to the   charge and mass transfer with the electrolyte. Hence, the FE towards C2+ products obtained at   the optimum ODA thickness of 2 nm would be a consequence of two opposite effects. An   incomplete ODA coverage still allowing the occurrence of HER, while a too dense ODA shell   being detrimental for the transfer of reagents or products with the surrounding medium as   Scheme 2. Correlation between the ODA coverage and ability of CO2 adsorption on the Cu2O   substrate. At high density, the ODA are vertically aligned and tightly packed, hindering CO2   adsorption; at low density the ODA molecules are almost flat on the surface, decreasing the   ability of CO2 to adsorb on the metal. At an optimal coverage, the ODA molecules are tilted   Considering the 33 % coverage as optimal, data from the model being in accordance with the   CuRN2 experimental system, we have performed a series of calculations on the adsorption of   key intermediates which can lead to both ethylene and ethanol with this coverage percentage.   Adsorption on the Cu2O surface at 33 % ODA coverage model was compared with   calculations on a bare Cu2O surface (Figure 4a). In agreement with recent literature,[20] we   considered the system charged. In particular, we focus on the *CHO and *CH adsorption as   possible intermediates for C2+ products, as well as one of the key intermediate to distinguish   between the formation of ethylene (*CCH) or ethanol (*CCHOH). In fact, from the   protonation of the carbon atoms in the *CCHOH intermediate, ethanol can be obtained in four   steps, while protonation of *CCH should, eventually, lead to ethylene as product.   Our computational results show that the presence of ODA has a profound effect on the   adsorption energy of the investigated intermediates, as it stabilizes the adsorption of *CO2,   *CCHOH and *CCH, while it destabilizes the *CHO and *CH adsorption in different   degrees. The largest change due to the ODA influence is observed for the *CH adsorption   energy, with a destabilization of 2.26 eV going from bare to ODA covered surface, due to the   formation of a shorter bond in the first, of 0.182 nm, compared to a bond distance of 0.190 m,   A different impact is observed for the *CCHOH and *CCH adsorption energies, being more   stable when ODA is present with values of -0.81 and -0.78 eV, respectively, while on the bare   surface the adsorption energy is weaker for both systems, with values of -0.46 and -0.62 eV,   respectively. The weaker stability obtained for *CCHOH on the bare surface can be attributed   to the lack of stabilizing interactions of the OH group in the intermediate with the nitrogen   atoms present in the ODA molecules. This, in turn, has a profound impact for the production   of either ethylene or ethanol. In fact, we can easily rationalize the experimental FE   considering the reaction energies of the selected intermediates (Figure 4b). When ODA is   present, the *CHO formation is thermodynamically favourable by -2.32 eV. From this   intermediate, two pathways can be followed. The first leads to a double protonation of the   carbonyl oxygen to obtain *CH, which can lead to ethylene after *CO insertion. Yet, *CH is   thermodynamically unstable compared to *CHO, with an energy of -0.22 eV, thus hampering   its formation and the subsequent ethylene formation. The second pathway considers the *CO   insertion on the *CHO intermediate, leading to *CCHOH, with an energy of -2.03 eV, which   is 0.1 eV more stable than the *CCH intermediate. This results in a slightly more favourable   ethanol formation when ODA is present, through *CCHOH, rather than water elimination to   A different scenario arises when the bare surface is considered. In this case, *CH has been   found more favourable thermodynamically compared to when ODA is present, although its   energy is still higher than that of *CHO, with value of -2.27 eV. Yet, at the applied potential   of -0.9 V vs. RHE there should be enough energy to overcome this barrier, and reaction can   continue towards the ethylene formation. On the other hand, on bare Cu2O surface *CCH is   more stable than *CCHOH by 0.1 eV, in a reverse situation than for the ODA covered   surface, thus suggesting that now the ethylene path should be more favourable, in good   Figure 4. (a) Adsorption energy values of selected intermediates on the ODA covered (2.14   nm thickness) (black) and bare Cu2O surface (red). (b) reaction energy of selected   In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy studies were carried out for CuODA2, CuODA4   and CuODA2-wash samples, at open circuit potential (Voc) and at a cathodic potential of -0.9   V. The results are presented as Figure S12 in SI. As it can be seen there, at -0.9 V potential   the CuODA2 spectrum exhibits several peaks that were not detected in CuODA4 and   CuODA2-wash. The main peak is located at 1537 cm-1 that can be assigned to adsorbed   - ,[21] which has been predicted to be one of the intermediates stabilized by   ODA. Additional peaks at 1368 and 1676 cm-1 have been previously attributed to carboxyl   (*COOH) and bidentate COO- species and carboxylate group, respectively.[21b] In a high   wavenumber region, two peaks centred at 2032 and 2089 cm-1 can be observed both in   CuODA2 and CuODA4, though in lesser intensity in the later. These have been previously   attributed to *CO bonded at different sites.[21b, 22] In the proposed mechanism, this adsorbed   *CO should insert in *CHO, leading to *CCHOH, which is the key intermediate in ethanol   formation. The high intensity in the signals attributed to the *CO in CuODA2 than in   CuODA4 suggests larger availability of adsorbed *CO that is required for the C2+ products   formation. The *CO intermediate could not be observed in the CuODA2-wash sample under   Overall, DFT calculations and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy support that the   ODA shell at the optimum thickness contribute to the stabilization of key intermediates   required for the formation of C2+ products, especially ethanol. A decrease in the ODA content   disminishes the ODA coverage on the Cu2O NPs, decreasing the hydrophobicity of the NP   surface, and, consequently, favouring HER. On the contrary, a thicker ODA shell could   prevent from efficient intermediates stabilization near the electrocatalyst surface, as well as   forming an electrical insulating layer disfavouring charge and mass transfer from electrolyte   To give additional support to our proposal, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)   was measured in all samples to disclose differences in the charge transfer properties of the   samples. EIS spectra of the different samples were collected in CO2-saturated 1 M KHCO3   electrolyte across 20 different potentials between -0.2 and -0.8 V vs. RHE in 0.03 V   increments. The results are presented as Figure S13 in SI. As a representative example, the   Nyquist plot of CuODA2 acquired at -0.7 V vs. RHE derived from these measurements is   As can be seen there, this plot is composed of a semicircle at higher frequency together with a   second feature at lower frequencies, in good agreement with previously reported related   examples.[17] The experimental data were fitted to a modified Randle’s circuit model (see   Figure S14 b), indicating two possible electrochemical interfaces with different time scales.   The obtained charge transfer resistance at the two different time scales (RLF and RHF for the   low frequency and high frequency domains, respectively) have been compared (Figure 5).   RHF has been attributed to the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte-electrocatalyst   interface, while RLF is typically assigned to Faradaic reactions that take normally place in   slower time scale.  As can be seen, the main differences in RLH and RHF take place at low   potentials. However, at -0.8 V vs. RHE, both RHF and RLF of all samples tend to converge into   very similar values. This suggests favourable charge transfer during the reaction, in good   agreement with previous reports.[17] CuODA4 and CuODA3 showed the highest RLF, while   and CuODA2 and CuODA2-wash demonstrated the lowest RLF of these measurements. This   is not surprising due to the insulating behaviour of ODA, in good agreement with the CDL data   and the DFT simulations. This is further evidenced by the low FE (60 -80 %) presented for   CuODA3 and CuODA4 in Figure 3. Due to the insulating effect of the ODA coating in these   samples, some charge could be consumed removing adsorbed species from the catalysts   surface. Hence, some trace products have not not taken into account in the FE calculation.   Figure 5. RHF, RLF, CPEHF and CPELF values obtained from the best fitting of the Nyquist   plots for CuODA1 (black squares), CuODA2 (red circles), CuODA3 (pink inverted triangles),   CuODA4 (green diamond) and CuODA2-wash (blue triangle) in the potential range from –   On the other hand, the capacitive parameters, represented by the constant-phase elements   CPEHF and CPELF, showed opposite trends. In the case of CPELF, the capacitance in all   samples increased with the negative potential, indicating higher population of charged species   in close contact with the catalysts surface. On the contrary, the CPEHF diminishes with the   increase in cathodic potential, suggesting a lower population of charged species in the double   layer. As can be seen, CuODA2-wash, CuODA1 and CuODA2, with lower ODA content,   presented highest density of charged species on the catalyst surface, while CuODA3 and   CuODA4, with the higher ODA thickness, exhibited the lowest population of charged species   near the active sites. All-in-all pointing to the thicker ODA coating results in an increase of   charge transfer resistance, and a concomitant decrease on the density of charged species on   It is worth noticing, however, that the EIS measurements have been carried out between -0.2   and -0.8 V vs. NHE. Measurements with larger potentials, including the optimum -0.9 V vs.   RHE, are not possible due to large fluctuations in the capacitance values as consequence of   the vigorous evolution of gases, which strongly disturb the EIS measurements. To overcome   this experimental hurdle, we used pulse voltammetry that allowed us to analyse the charge   accumulation and desorption kinetics on the electrocatalyst surface using short pulses (0.5 s)   from an anodic potential of + 0.3 V vs NHE (near OCP) up to a cathodic potential range from   -0.7 to -1 V vs. NHE (Figure S15 a in SI), as reported before.[13] The transient current profiles   of all samples were acquired in this way (see Figure S11 b-f in SI), and fitted to a combination   From the experimental data fitting, second-order decay kinetics parameters (C2nd and k2nd)   were obtained for all samples. C2nd represents the initial current (t=0) and describes the   surface charge accumulation, while k2nd describes the current decay rate and it is related with   the cumulative desorption rate of species on the catalysts surface. As can be seen in Figure 6,   C2nd followed identical trend than that obtained from CPEHF in Figure 5, where CuRN2-wash   shows the highest initial surface accumulation, followed by CuODA1 and CuODA2, being   Figure 6. Pulsed voltammetry-derived parameters C2nd (a) and k2nd (b) obtained from the   fitting of the pulse voltammetry measurements in CuRN1 (black squares), CuRN2 (red dots),   CuRN3 (pink inverted triangles), CuRN4 (green diamonds) and CuRN2-wash (bleu triangles).   However, the k2nd parameter obtained from the different samples shows that CuODA2-wash   exhibits the fastest desorption rate of species, while CuODA2 presents the slowest desorption   kinetics. It is well known, that the formation C2+ products require multiple electron and proton   transfer, and therefore, intermediates should remain adsorbed on the surface catalysts long   enough for this multiple charge and proton transfer. Hence, this result could explain the   enhanced FE for C2+ products demonstrated by CuODA2. In comparison with CuODA1, both   present similar initial charge accumulation, however, the intermediate species desorb faster in   CuODA1 than in CuODA2, explaining the higher selectivity towards C2+ in CuODA2.   CuODA3 and CuODA4 have lower initial surface charge than CuODA2, besides slightly   charge accumulation, the desorption rate is 5 times faster in CuODA2-wash than in CuODA2,   and therefore, the intermediate species leading to C2+ remain longer time on CuODA2 catalyst   surface, promoting the improved FE for C2+ products. Overall, pulsed voltammetry   demonstrated in CuODA2 is the key factor resulting in a more efficient formation of C2+.   It is well-known that the information obtained from the H-cell configuration cannot be   extrapolated directly into the dynamic environment of a continuous flow electrolyser as   consequence of the mass transport limitations in H-cell, which limit current densities to values   lower than 100 mA/cm2, bearing little resemblance with commercial electrolyzers. For these   reasons, and encouraged by the outstanding selectivity towards C2+ products obtained using   CuODA2, the FE of this electrocatalyst was also tested under industrially relevant operation   conditions, using a flow cell at the current density range from 100 to 400 mA/cm2. The results   are presented in Figure S16 in SI. As can be seen there, FE towards C2+ products increases   with the current density up to 300 mA/cm2, being the C2+ FE of 73.5 %, very close to that   obtained in the H-cell (Figure 3). At larger current density values (400 mA/cm2), the C2+ FE   decreased to 60.3 %. Interestingly, CH3COOH and CH3CH2CH2OH, beside CH2=CH2 and   CH3CH2OH, were detected in the continuous flow conditions. For comparison purposes,   CuODA2-wash sample was also evaluated under identical flow conditions. In this case,   CH3COOH, CH3CH2CH2OH, CH2CH2 and CH3CH2OH were also detected, but the C2+ FE   was of 42.6 %, in good agreement with the worse performance measured in the H-cell (Figure   Finally, XRD pattern of CuODA2 after continuous flow operation at 300 mA/cm2 for 2 h was   compared to that of the fresh sample. The XRD presented in Figure S17 in SI show that Cu2O   is still the main crystal phase in the extensively used electrocatalyst, highlighting the stability   of this electrocatalyst under industrially relevant conditions for the production of C2+   products. Moreover, the stability of the ODA layer has been confirmed by HRTEM images,   FITR spectroscopy and combustion elemental analysis of the used electrocatalyst. HRTEM   images (Figure S18 in SI) of CuODA2 after reaction show that the amorphous layer on the   catalyst surface is preserved after reaction. Moreover, the FTIR spectrum after reaction   (Figure S19 in SI) presents identical vibrational peaks as the ones previously attributed to   ODA. The combustion elemental analysis results are summarized in Table S2 in SI. The   obtained C and N contents (wt.%) in CuODA2 after the reaction are very similar to those of   the fresh sample. However, a small decrease in C and N can be observed. This is suggesting   that a small portion of the ODA molecules could have been released under the reaction   conditions. Despite this, in overall, the CuODA2 electrocatalysts presents high stability under   The present results show that ODA coating is an efficient strategy to increase their FE of   Cu2O NPs towards C2+ products that can reach at the optimal shell thickness values of 73.6 %   at 300 mA/cm2. Electrochemical measurements indicates that this good performance derives   from the balance between a slower desorption of the key reaction intermediates leading to C2+   products and still adequate mass and charge transfer at the interface Cu2O-electrolyte, while   DFT calculations on models indicate that at the optimal loading ODA molecules tend to   arrange perpendicularly to the Cu2O surface as consequence of the dense packing. ODA   coating is stable at least for 2 h under high current density operation, due to the strong   interaction of the Cu atoms with the amino groups. In this way, our results illustrate the high   sensitivity of the product distribution in eCO2R to the surface of the electrocatalyst and the   presence of simple molecules, showing a way for even further improvements.   Synthesis of CuODA electrocatalysts: Firstly, a mixture of copper (II) acetylacetonate (0.130   g, 0.5 mmol), different amounts of octadecylamine (ODA) and 1-octadecene (ODE, 10 mL)   was evacuated in a round bottom flask at room temperature and, then, heated to 135 oC for 2   h. After complete dissolution of the reactants, the flask was filled with Ar, and the solution   was heated to 205 oC until the color changes to brown-yellow, allowing afterwards the   reaction to continue for an additional 20 min. After this time, the system was cooled down at   ambient temperature. Finally, the series of CuODAx samples were obtained after filtering,   washing with toluene and drying at 60 oC overnight. CuODA1, CuODA2, CuODA3, and   CuODA4 correspond to samples prepared using 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg of ODA,   respectively. CuODA2-wash was obtained by sonicating the mixture solution of CuODA2   Characterization: Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Shimadzu   XRD-7000 diffractometer by using Cu κα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å), operating at 40 kV and 40   mA at a scan rate of 10 o per min in the 2–90o 2 range. The FTIR spectra were collected   with a Bruker “Vertex 70” and a Thermo Nicolet 8700 spectrophotometer equipped with a   Microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a Philips CM300 FEG microscope   operating at 200 kV, coupled with an X-Max 80 energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector   (Oxford instruments). The microscope is equipped with the STEM unit, the dark-field and   spectrophotometry (ICP-OES, Varian 715-ES, CA, USA) analyses were carried out after   completely dissolving the sample with nitric acid using calibrated standards. X-ray   photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured on a SPECS spectrometer equipped with a   Phoibos 150 MCD-9 detector using a nonmonochromatic X-ray source (Al) operating at 200   W. Fitting of the experimental data to individual components was calculated from the area of   the corresponding peaks after nonlinear background subtraction of the Shirley type. Atomic   ratios of the different elements were determined from the areas of the corresponding XPS   peaks, corrected by the response factor of the spectrometer. In-situ Raman spectra were   obtained using a Renishaw “in Via” spectrophotometer equipped with an Olympus optical   microscope. Electrochemical characterization was carried out in a Gamry instruments model   Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction tests: A circular glassy carbon electrode with 3 mm diameter   was used as the working electrode. 5 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 0.5 mL isopropanol   and 40 μL Nafion solution via ultrasonication in an ice bath for 40 min. 30 μL of the catalyst   ink was deposited onto the polished glassy carbon to achieve a 0.42 mg/cm2 catalyst loading.   The catalyst ink was then dried overnight at room temperature. All electrochemical   measurements were done using a calibrated potentiostat (Gamry Interface 5000E) using an",

RKKY-induced IEC typically presents\ndamped oscillations with spacer thickness. Moreover,\nit can be ambipolar for some metals, e.g., Ru, Ir etc.,\nenabling varying strengths of FM (parallel) and AF\n(anti-parallel) alignment45. Here, Ir is chosen as the\nIEC-mediating spacer46 as it also generates sizable in-\nterfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, required for\nchiral spin textures5,7,47.\nTo characterize IEC evolution, multilayer stacks com-\nprising two repetitions of Ir(tIr)/Co(1)/Pt(1) (thickness\nin nm in parenthesis, Fig. 1a) were deposited for varying\nIr thickness, tIr (0.2−1.8 nm). Magnetometry measure-\nments consistently evidence perpendicular anisotropy,\nand out-of-plane (OP) magnetization hysteresis loops\n(M (H)) exhibit two distinct shapes across varying tIr\n(Fig. 1b). For tIr ∼ 1 nm, they have typical FM (near-\nrectangular) character, with high remanence (Fig. 1b:\ngreen). For tIr < 0.8 nm (Fig. 1b: orange), M is near-\nzero for |H| < Hex, due to anti-parallel alignment of\nthe Co layers, and near-Ms for larger fields. Here Ms\nis the saturation magnetization (i.e., at Hs), and the\nexchange field, Hex,\nis defined as M (Hex) = Ms/2.\nFig. 1c shows the variation of µ0Hex for tIr over 0.2−1.8\nnm, with characteristic oscillatory behaviour45. AF-\nIEC (Hex > 0) is observed for tIr over 0.2 − 0.8 nm,\nand also over 1.2 − 1.5 nm (Fig. 1c: pink regions), al-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nbeit with reduced magnitude for the latter due to the\nspatial decay of IEC. These trends are consistent with\nprior reports on Co/Ir-based multilayers46,48.\nCombining such AF coupling with FM-IEC can extend\ncompensated stacks from bilayers to multilayers34,49.\nHere, we posit that chiral spin textures inherently gener-\nated in near-identical constituent chiral stacks50 can be\nAF-coupled to generate compact SAF textures (Fig. 1d,\nSI §S1). Our base stack – Ir/Fe/Co/Pt – is an estab-\nlished host of nanoscale N´eel skyrmions with tunable\nproperties7,47. The chiral multilayer comprises three\nrepetitions of Ir(1)/Fe(0.2)/Co(1.2)/Pt(0.8) (see Meth-\nods) to ensure robust skyrmion formation50, while mini-\nmizing complexities arising from interlayer dipolar cou-\npling effects51. The chosen FM thicknesses optimize\nimaging contrast, while those of Pt(0.8) and Ir(1.0) en-\nsure a strongly coupled multilayer. Next, two such mul-\ntilayers are coupled by an Ir spacer with two distinct\nthicknesses (Fig. 2a) – generating AF-IEC (tIr = 0.5\nnm, identified as AFS), and FM-IEC (tIr = 1.0 nm:\nFMS), respectively. The composite stack sandwiches\nthe critical Ir spacer with identical Co(1.0) layers that\nensure coherent coupling.\nC. Texture Evolution in Composite Stacks\nFig. 2b-e show results from magnetometry and field-\ndependent MFM imaging of the composite stacks. For\nthe FMS (Fig. 2b), the M (H) loop is sheared, and MFM\n(Fig. 2d) expectedly shows a labyrinthine ZF state.\nWith increasing µ0H, it evolves into discrete stripes and\nsparse skyrmions enroute to saturation – a transition\nwell-observed for chiral multilayers5,7,8. Contrastingly,\nthe M (H) loop of the AFS (Fig. 2c) exhibits qualita-\ntively distinct evolution, with a ZF plateau and two dis-\ntinct sheared regions (shaded pink, blue), separated by\na jump at Hex, enroute to Hs. The reduced ZF plateau\nfor AFS (µ0Hex ∼ 110 mT) c.f.\nIr/Co/Pt bilayer\n(Fig. 1b: µ0Hex ∼ 400 mT), is attributed to the com-\n46,48. Meanwhile, MFM\nposite stack, and its lower Keff\nalso reveals two distinct field-evolution regimes, with\nthe near-ZF region (Fig. 2e) showing sparse, mostly\nskyrmionic textures, which disappear into the uniform\nbackground at ∼30 mT. Above ∼110 mT (∼µ0Hex,\nFig. 2e: right), a labyrinthine state suddenly reappears,\nand evolves into stripes, then skyrmions, and finally to\na uniform state at ∼180 mT (∼µ0Hs).\nTo lay out a phenomenological picture, we performed\ngrain-free micromagnetic simulations of a minimum-\nmodel, six-layer composite stack designed to qualita-\ntively emulate the key features of experimentally stud-\nied AFS and FMS structures (Fig. 3a). The simulations\nemployed established recipes and parameters from re-\nlated prior works (see Methods, SI §S2)47,50,52. The\nIECs between successive FMs were modeled using three\ndistinct parameters (η1, η2, ηFM/AF), the distinct heavy\nmetal (HM) spacers36,45,48,50. Notably, opposite signs\nof ηFM,AF generate the distinct behaviours of AFSSim\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFIG. 2. Imaged Field Evolution of FMS and AFS Stacks.

While the FMSSim loop (Fig. 3b) is typi-\ncally sheared, the AFSSim loop (Fig. 3c) resembles the\nconcatenation of two FMS loops at µ0Hex ≃ 100 mT.\nUpon ascertaining the validity of the simulated stacks,\nwe turn to the microscopic magnetization evolution,\nwherein simulations provide layer-wise information on\nlayers L3, L4 ad-\nspin texture character (Fig. 3d-e:\njacent to ηFM/AF). While FMSSim exhibits prototyp-\nical stripes and skyrmions with identical magnetization\nacross layers (Fig. 3d), AFSSim exhibits two distinct\ntexture evolution trends demarcated by µ0Hex. At and\naround ZF (Fig. 3e), AFSSim shows isolated stripe tex-\ntures with compensated (SAF-like) character, i.e., L3\nand L4 magnetizations are coincident and anti-aligned.\nThese compensated textures shrink and disappear at\n∼30 mT (≪ µ0Hex). At µ0Hex ≃ 120 mT (>µ0Hex),\nspin textures abruptly reappear as a labyrinthine config-\nuration, however with L3 and L4 magnetizations aligned\nand with distinct spatial configurations. With increas-\ning field, the two layers exhibit distinct stripe and\nskyrmion configurations, which disappear at ∼200 mT\n(∼µ0Hs). Meanwhile, the observed variation in simu-\nlated layer-dependent texture intensities, arising from\nknown limitations of the grain-free minimal model (SI\n§S2), motivate future efforts to achieve quantitative\nconsistency with experiments.\nThe simulations elucidate several aspects of spin\ntexture evolution in the composite AFS. First, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nMFM-imaged round textures at ZF are SAF-coupled\nskyrmions, and are visible due to their imperfectly com-\npensated inhomogeneous stray fields. Second, there is\nclear dichotomy in texture character around Hex. At\nhigher fields (H > Hex), the two SAF-coupled stacks\nshould each host distinct textures with aligned magne-\ntization. In fact, as seen in Fig. 3f, these texture con-\nfigurations do not exhibit any overlap, and are in fact\nspatially segregated and seemingly anti-correlated. The\nobserved AFS phenomenology, arising from the inter-\nplay of IEC, bias field, and texture character, motivates\nquantitative imaging studies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nD.

Previous works have\nemployed MPC to study the helicity, spatial extent,\nand magnetic parameters of spin textures19,29,36,55. For\na multilayered film, ⃗HS is a vector superposition of\nstray fields from each magnetic layer, which would\nsum constructively (destructively) for FM- (AF-) cou-\npled stacks. Meanwhile, the larger stray field from\nnear-surface layers can enable MPC quantification of\nmagnetization-compensated SAF skyrmions36, in con-\ntrast to their null signal in transmission techniques56.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFIG. 3.

Accordingly, copies of AFS\nand FMS samples were carefully etched to remove the\ntop half of the stack above the Ir-coupling layer (see\nFig. 2a). The resulting 1/2-AFS and 1/2-FMS samples\nwith nominally identical magnetic properties are suited\nfor validation (see Methods, SI §S1,2). Across these\nsamples (Fig. 4a-b: schematics), we expect MPC to be\nhighest for FMS (top), followed by 1/2-FMS and 1/2-\nAFS (middle), and lowest for AFS (bottom). To ensure\nobjective comparison, the entire dataset (Fig. 4c) was\nacquired using a single MFM tip, with identical scan\nconditions across samples and magnetic fields. Subse-\nquently, all identified textures across MFM images were\niteratively fit to determine their MPC amplitude, Φ0,\nand texture width (see Methods, SI §S3).\nFig. 4c shows the variation of ensemble-averaged MPC,\n⟨Φ0⟩(H), with OP field (µ0H) quantified over large, sta-\ntistically significant fields-of-view for the four samples.\nExcepting AFS, the samples exhibit similar field-trends\nwith distinct amplitudes, separated by 5-10 times the\nmagnitude of individual statistical spreads. Expectedly,\nthe MPC is highest for FMS (Fig. 4c: top, ⟨Φ0⟩ZF ≈\n0.4◦), followed by near-identical values for 1/2-FMS and\n1/2-AFS, (Fig. 4c: middle, ⟨Φ0⟩ZF ≈ 0.2◦), validating\nthe experimental methodology. Next, ⟨Φ0⟩(H) reduces\nmonotonically (30−50%) likely due to field-induced tex-\nture shrinking and tip magnetization alignment effects\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n– also evidenced in micromagnetic simulations (SI §S2),\nand in prior works on microscale spin-textures49. Fi-\nnally, for AFS, the MPC is substantially lower (Fig. 4c:\nbottom, ⟨Φ0⟩ZF < 0.1◦), confirming their stray-field-\ncompensated SAF character at ZF. Crucially, while\n⟨Φ0⟩(H) initially decreases, it sharply jumps upward\nat ∼100 mT (∼µ0Hex), before decreasing to saturation.\nThe abrupt jump in the MPC evolution of AFS evi-\ndences a transition in texture character, consistent with\ntheir above Hex uncoupling between chiral stacks ex-\npected from simulations (Fig. 3f). The uncompen-\nsated stray field of uncoupled textures should yield\nMPC larger than for SAF textures (AFS: near-ZF),\nyet lower than for FMS textures. Indeed, ⟨Φ0⟩(H) of\nAFS for H > Hex smoothly extrapolates to that of 1/2-\nAFS/FMS stacks, indicating their qualitative similarity.\nMeanwhile, closer inspection of MFM images (Fig. 4d:\nbottom) reveals two distinct sets of MPCs within the\nsame field-of view. Statistical analysis of H > Hex spin-\ntexture ensembles consistently shows a bimodal (two-\npeaked) MPC distribution (SI §S3), in contrast to Gaus-\nsian (single-peak) distributions for conventional spin-\ntextures. Simulations predict distinct, spatially segre-\ngated spin textures (Fig. 3e-f) in the two component\nstacks, which should manifest in MFM with different\nMPCs. Thus, we conclude that higher MPC textures\n(Fig. 4d: bottom, “A”) form in the top half-stack, while\nlower MPC textures (Fig. 4d: bottom, “B”) are in the\nbottom half-stack. Future minor-loop magnetometry-\nimaging studies of the AFS may shed valuable insights\non the formation mechanisms and transitions of SAF-\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFIG. 4.

For FMS (Fig. 5a), skyrmions form near satu-\nration (∼100 mT), and dS (∼80 nm) decreases by ∼20%\nin line with literature5,7.\nover a narrow field range,\nMeanwhile, for AFS, dS first decreases over the low-\nfield SAF-coupled regime, then abruptly jumps up for\nthe uncoupled regime (H > Hex), and decreases again\nto saturation. These AFS and FMS field trends mir-\nror those for the MPC amplitudes (Fig. 4c), evidencing\ntheir shared origin49. Notably, while AFS and FMS em-\nploy identical chiral stacks, the near-ZF SAF skyrmions\nare directly comparable to FM skyrmions at the highest\nfields (µ0H ∼ 100 mT). This underscores the profound\nimplications of AF-IEC on skyrmion stability, energet-\nics, and kinetics50. Finally, the reported SAF skyrmion\nsizes compare well with literature36,38–40,43. Future\nworks can explore composite SAF stacks with strongly\nchiral layers (e.g.,7,47) to develop SAF skyrmions with\nfurther reduced size and enhanced stability.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nE. Conclusion\nIn summary, we have established a composite multi-\nlayer platform wherein the character and evolution of\nchiral spin textures is demonstrably modulated by the\ninterplay of stack-tunable AF- and FM-IECs, and by\nmagnetic field. The AFS stack generates robust SAF-\ncoupled skyrmions at ZF, whose internal stray field\ncompensation results in strongly diminished contrast\ncompared to FM textures. Strikingly, the internal effec-\ntive field from AF-IEC ensures that the SAF skyrmions\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFIG. 5. Field Evolution of Skyrmion Sizes.

Moreover, the composite stack\ndecouples above the AF-IEC field (Hex), yielding indi-\nvidual, spatially segregated spin-textures in each half-\nstack.\nThe\nSAF-coupled ZF\nskyrmions with reduced size and enhanced stability has\nimmediate relevance to devices employing skyrmions\nand beyond. First, while skyrmions in bilayer SAFs\nexhibit fast, linear motion43, there are inevitable fluc-\ntuations in properties due to their bubble-like nature.\nIn contrast, compact SAF skyrmions – strengthened\nadditionally by FM-IEC50 – should be endowed with\ngreater resilience to perturbations24. This should en-\nable more coherent and robust dynamics with racetrack\ndevices2,58.\nSecond, uniform SAF stacks are being\nincreasingly explored as the active layer for magnetic\ntunnel junctions (MTJs) with enhanced immunity59.\nIncorporating a SAF skyrmion stack within two-\nterminal MTJs can enable multiple, robust electrical\nstates, with facile manipulation13. Lastly, the hitherto\nunexplored skyrmion coupling crossover (H ∼ Hex),\ngoverned by AF- and FM-IECs36,50, presents a rich,\ntunable spin-texture phase space29,31,60,61. The ability\nto propagate quasi-independent skyrmions in each\nlayer, or to control propagation in one layer via the\nother, offers lucrative prospects for stacked racetracks.\nSuch devices may be employed for reconfigurable logic\nand unconventional computing2,\nin particular within\nprobabilistic and reservoir architectures62.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nrespectively.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nF.

Finally, 1/2-FMS and 1/2-AFS stacks\nwere fabricated by etching the primary stacks with pre-\ncise end-point detection (see SI §S1).\nMagnetometry. M (H) loops were measured on diced\nsamples using a MicroMag™ alternating gradient mag-\nnetometer. The measured magnetic properties of all\nstacks are detailed in SI §S1, and consistent with our\nprevious works22,47.\nMFM Experiments were performed using a Bruker\nDimension Icon™ 3100 atomic force microscope, using\nCo-alloy coated SSS-MFMR tips from NanoSensors™\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n(magnetization ∼80 emu/cm3, diameter ∼30 nm).

Great care was taken to\navoid any changes to the MFM tip through the dataset,\nwhich would affect the MPC, and preclude quantitative\ncomparisons. Similarly rigorous validation experiments\nwere performed for multiple samples, including with co-\nlocated half- and full stacks (SI §S4). After processing\nthe MFM images, spin-textures were individually iden-\ntified and fit using established recipes to determine their\nMPC amplitude and width (Fig. 4, SI §S3).\nMicromagnetic Simulations were performed using\nthe mumax3 software package63 with a 2 nm mesh over\na 2 µm-sized grid. The effective medium model8 was\nused to simulate reduced stacks with six magnetic lay-\ners L1-L6 (Fig. 3a), modelled upon experimental stacks.\nThe simulated stacks used magnetic parameters from\nmeasurements (see SI §S1) and related prior works on\nsimilar Ir/Fe/Co/Pt stacks47,50,52,with slight optimiza-\ntion of Keff . Established simulation recipes were used to\ngenerate the layer-wise magnetization profile with vary-\ning OP field22,47,63.\nIECs between successive FMs were modelled using\nthree distinct parameters to emulate different HM spac-\ners – η2 for Ir(1)/Pt(1); η1 for Pt(0.8), and ηFM/AF for\nthe Ir(tIr).\nInitial estimates for IECs used measured\nvalues for similar multilayers36,50. These values were\noptimized based on hysteresis loops, resulting in η1 =\n0.40 mJ/m2, η2 = 0.28 mJ/m2, ηFM= +0.0535 mJ/m2\nand ηAF = -0.535 mJ/m2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAcknowledgments.

         " Zero Field Antiferromagnetically Coupled Skyrmions and their Field-Driven Uncoupling in Composite Chiral Multilayers   skyrmions   A. Introduction topologically wound, are Magnetic nanoscale spin structures that form within a uni- form magnetic background1,2. First discovered in chiral magnets3,4, they can be generated at room temperature in multilayer thin films5–7. Their current- driven dynamics in racetracks8–12 as well as efficient junctions13–15 are readout and switching in tunnel promising for emerging computing applications2,16,17. However, several prevailing attributes of conventional ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmions inhibit the realization of practical devices. Their equilibrium size and resilience to perturbations are constrained, especially at zero magnetic field (ZF), by their intrinsic stray field18–20 and instability to elongation21,22. Meanwhile, their electrical mobility is limited by their topological charge, which introduces both transverse deflection10,11,23,24 and additional damping contributions18. These limitations can be circumvented by compact anti- ferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions, whose minimal stray field and zero effective topological charge can enable enhanced resilience and mobility25,26. in skyrmion Promising ferrimagnets27–30 have motivated efforts to develop fully-compensated AF textures. Intrinsic chiral an- tiferromagnets host a zoo of myriad textures31, and exchange-bias imprinting of ferromagnets onto conven- tional antiferromagnets yields compensated skyrmions with hybrid chirality32,33 – whose functionalities remain to be established. Meanwhile, practically most promising are synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs),   characteristics   observed   address   which can host oppositely polarized skyrmions in adjacent chiral layers34,35. SAF skyrmions may retain known benefits of FM skyrmions, with enhancements from AF compensation26. Several works on bilayer SAFs show compensated skyrmion bubbles36–40, nu- cleation via electrical and optical techniques39,41, and near-linear current-driven dynamics42,43. Notably, their compensated topological charge has been recently employed to realize uninhibited skyrmion mobility43. However, key challenges concerning skyrmion stability to deformation, annihilation, and pinning remain to be addressed43. These limitations are inextricably linked to the inherent ”bubble” character of skyrmions within the individual chiral layers of bilayer SAFs. an designing We Ir/Fe/Co/Pt-based composite chiral SAF multi- layer, which hosts chiral AF textures by synergistically combining FM and AF interlayer exchange couplings (IECs). Quantitative comparison of spin-textures in SAF stacks with FM counterparts via magnetic force microscopy (MFM), magnetometry, and micromagnetic simulations, stray-field compensated compact structure. While FM-IEC enables inher- ent textural stability within each constituent chiral stack, AF-IEC between chiral stacks provides a large exchange field (∼100 mT), facilitating the presence of SAF skyrmions at ZF. With increasing field, they decouple and yield independent, spatially segregated textures in the constituent chiral multilayers. These results provide a platform for developing robust SAF skyrmions compatible with all-electrical control13.   bottleneck   cements   B. Stack Design and Properties In multilayer films, two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer exhibit IEC due to the interlayer Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)   interaction44. RKKY-induced IEC typically presents damped oscillations with spacer thickness. Moreover, it can be ambipolar for some metals, e.g., Ru, Ir etc., enabling varying strengths of FM (parallel) and AF (anti-parallel) alignment45. Here, Ir is chosen as the IEC-mediating spacer46 as it also generates sizable in- terfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, required for chiral spin textures5,7,47. To characterize IEC evolution, multilayer stacks com- prising two repetitions of Ir(tIr)/Co(1)/Pt(1) (thickness in nm in parenthesis, Fig. 1a) were deposited for varying Ir thickness, tIr (0.2−1.8 nm). Magnetometry measure- ments consistently evidence perpendicular anisotropy, and out-of-plane (OP) magnetization hysteresis loops (M (H)) exhibit two distinct shapes across varying tIr (Fig. 1b). For tIr ∼ 1 nm, they have typical FM (near- rectangular) character, with high remanence (Fig. 1b: green). For tIr < 0.8 nm (Fig. 1b: orange), M is near- zero for |H| < Hex, due to anti-parallel alignment of the Co layers, and near-Ms for larger fields. Here Ms is the saturation magnetization (i.e., at Hs), and the exchange field, Hex, is defined as M (Hex) = Ms/2. Fig. 1c shows the variation of µ0Hex for tIr over 0.2−1.8 nm, with characteristic oscillatory behaviour45. AF- IEC (Hex > 0) is observed for tIr over 0.2 − 0.8 nm, and also over 1.2 − 1.5 nm (Fig. 1c: pink regions), al-   beit with reduced magnitude for the latter due to the spatial decay of IEC. These trends are consistent with prior reports on Co/Ir-based multilayers46,48. Combining such AF coupling with FM-IEC can extend compensated stacks from bilayers to multilayers34,49. Here, we posit that chiral spin textures inherently gener- ated in near-identical constituent chiral stacks50 can be AF-coupled to generate compact SAF textures (Fig. 1d, SI §S1). Our base stack – Ir/Fe/Co/Pt – is an estab- lished host of nanoscale N´eel skyrmions with tunable properties7,47. The chiral multilayer comprises three repetitions of Ir(1)/Fe(0.2)/Co(1.2)/Pt(0.8) (see Meth- ods) to ensure robust skyrmion formation50, while mini- mizing complexities arising from interlayer dipolar cou- pling effects51. The chosen FM thicknesses optimize imaging contrast, while those of Pt(0.8) and Ir(1.0) en- sure a strongly coupled multilayer. Next, two such mul- tilayers are coupled by an Ir spacer with two distinct thicknesses (Fig. 2a) – generating AF-IEC (tIr = 0.5 nm, identified as AFS), and FM-IEC (tIr = 1.0 nm: FMS), respectively. The composite stack sandwiches the critical Ir spacer with identical Co(1.0) layers that ensure coherent coupling. C. Texture Evolution in Composite Stacks Fig. 2b-e show results from magnetometry and field- dependent MFM imaging of the composite stacks. For the FMS (Fig. 2b), the M (H) loop is sheared, and MFM (Fig. 2d) expectedly shows a labyrinthine ZF state. With increasing µ0H, it evolves into discrete stripes and sparse skyrmions enroute to saturation – a transition well-observed for chiral multilayers5,7,8. Contrastingly, the M (H) loop of the AFS (Fig. 2c) exhibits qualita- tively distinct evolution, with a ZF plateau and two dis- tinct sheared regions (shaded pink, blue), separated by a jump at Hex, enroute to Hs. The reduced ZF plateau for AFS (µ0Hex ∼ 110 mT) c.f. Ir/Co/Pt bilayer (Fig. 1b: µ0Hex ∼ 400 mT), is attributed to the com- 46,48. Meanwhile, MFM posite stack, and its lower Keff also reveals two distinct field-evolution regimes, with the near-ZF region (Fig. 2e) showing sparse, mostly skyrmionic textures, which disappear into the uniform background at ∼30 mT. Above ∼110 mT (∼µ0Hex, Fig. 2e: right), a labyrinthine state suddenly reappears, and evolves into stripes, then skyrmions, and finally to a uniform state at ∼180 mT (∼µ0Hs). To lay out a phenomenological picture, we performed grain-free micromagnetic simulations of a minimum- model, six-layer composite stack designed to qualita- tively emulate the key features of experimentally stud- ied AFS and FMS structures (Fig. 3a). The simulations employed established recipes and parameters from re- lated prior works (see Methods, SI §S2)47,50,52. The IECs between successive FMs were modeled using three distinct parameters (η1, η2, ηFM/AF), the distinct heavy metal (HM) spacers36,45,48,50. Notably, opposite signs of ηFM,AF generate the distinct behaviours of AFSSim   (ηAF > 0) and FMSSim (ηAF < 0) respectively46,48. The OP hysteresis loops, mz(H), of the two simulated stacks (Fig. 3b-c) evidence distinct evolutions, quali- tatively similar to the respective experimental results (Fig. 2b-c). While the FMSSim loop (Fig. 3b) is typi- cally sheared, the AFSSim loop (Fig. 3c) resembles the concatenation of two FMS loops at µ0Hex ≃ 100 mT. Upon ascertaining the validity of the simulated stacks, we turn to the microscopic magnetization evolution, wherein simulations provide layer-wise information on layers L3, L4 ad- spin texture character (Fig. 3d-e: jacent to ηFM/AF). While FMSSim exhibits prototyp- ical stripes and skyrmions with identical magnetization across layers (Fig. 3d), AFSSim exhibits two distinct texture evolution trends demarcated by µ0Hex. At and around ZF (Fig. 3e), AFSSim shows isolated stripe tex- tures with compensated (SAF-like) character, i.e., L3 and L4 magnetizations are coincident and anti-aligned. These compensated textures shrink and disappear at ∼30 mT (≪ µ0Hex). At µ0Hex ≃ 120 mT (>µ0Hex), spin textures abruptly reappear as a labyrinthine config- uration, however with L3 and L4 magnetizations aligned and with distinct spatial configurations. With increas- ing field, the two layers exhibit distinct stripe and skyrmion configurations, which disappear at ∼200 mT (∼µ0Hs). Meanwhile, the observed variation in simu- lated layer-dependent texture intensities, arising from known limitations of the grain-free minimal model (SI §S2), motivate future efforts to achieve quantitative consistency with experiments. The simulations elucidate several aspects of spin texture evolution in the composite AFS. First, the   MFM-imaged round textures at ZF are SAF-coupled skyrmions, and are visible due to their imperfectly com- pensated inhomogeneous stray fields. Second, there is clear dichotomy in texture character around Hex. At higher fields (H > Hex), the two SAF-coupled stacks should each host distinct textures with aligned magne- tization. In fact, as seen in Fig. 3f, these texture con- figurations do not exhibit any overlap, and are in fact spatially segregated and seemingly anti-correlated. The observed AFS phenomenology, arising from the inter- play of IEC, bias field, and texture character, motivates quantitative imaging studies.   D. Phase Contrast & Texture   The magnetic phase contrast (MPC), ∆Φ, detected by the MFM tip (magnetization, ⃗Mtip) is given as53,54   where ⃗HS is the stray field from the sample, and the in- tegral is over tip volume, Vtip. Previous works have employed MPC to study the helicity, spatial extent, and magnetic parameters of spin textures19,29,36,55. For a multilayered film, ⃗HS is a vector superposition of stray fields from each magnetic layer, which would sum constructively (destructively) for FM- (AF-) cou- pled stacks. Meanwhile, the larger stray field from near-surface layers can enable MPC quantification of magnetization-compensated SAF skyrmions36, in con- trast to their null signal in transmission techniques56.   Therefore, MPC can provide a detailed picture of the evolution of spin texture character. Quantitative MPC analysis requires a principled ap- proach to disentangle tip, sample, and field-dependent contributions (Eq. 1). Accordingly, copies of AFS and FMS samples were carefully etched to remove the top half of the stack above the Ir-coupling layer (see Fig. 2a). The resulting 1/2-AFS and 1/2-FMS samples with nominally identical magnetic properties are suited for validation (see Methods, SI §S1,2). Across these samples (Fig. 4a-b: schematics), we expect MPC to be highest for FMS (top), followed by 1/2-FMS and 1/2- AFS (middle), and lowest for AFS (bottom). To ensure objective comparison, the entire dataset (Fig. 4c) was acquired using a single MFM tip, with identical scan conditions across samples and magnetic fields. Subse- quently, all identified textures across MFM images were iteratively fit to determine their MPC amplitude, Φ0, and texture width (see Methods, SI §S3). Fig. 4c shows the variation of ensemble-averaged MPC, ⟨Φ0⟩(H), with OP field (µ0H) quantified over large, sta- tistically significant fields-of-view for the four samples. Excepting AFS, the samples exhibit similar field-trends with distinct amplitudes, separated by 5-10 times the magnitude of individual statistical spreads. Expectedly, the MPC is highest for FMS (Fig. 4c: top, ⟨Φ0⟩ZF ≈ 0.4◦), followed by near-identical values for 1/2-FMS and 1/2-AFS, (Fig. 4c: middle, ⟨Φ0⟩ZF ≈ 0.2◦), validating the experimental methodology. Next, ⟨Φ0⟩(H) reduces monotonically (30−50%) likely due to field-induced tex- ture shrinking and tip magnetization alignment effects   – also evidenced in micromagnetic simulations (SI §S2), and in prior works on microscale spin-textures49. Fi- nally, for AFS, the MPC is substantially lower (Fig. 4c: bottom, ⟨Φ0⟩ZF < 0.1◦), confirming their stray-field- compensated SAF character at ZF. Crucially, while ⟨Φ0⟩(H) initially decreases, it sharply jumps upward at ∼100 mT (∼µ0Hex), before decreasing to saturation. The abrupt jump in the MPC evolution of AFS evi- dences a transition in texture character, consistent with their above Hex uncoupling between chiral stacks ex- pected from simulations (Fig. 3f). The uncompen- sated stray field of uncoupled textures should yield MPC larger than for SAF textures (AFS: near-ZF), yet lower than for FMS textures. Indeed, ⟨Φ0⟩(H) of AFS for H > Hex smoothly extrapolates to that of 1/2- AFS/FMS stacks, indicating their qualitative similarity. Meanwhile, closer inspection of MFM images (Fig. 4d: bottom) reveals two distinct sets of MPCs within the same field-of view. Statistical analysis of H > Hex spin- texture ensembles consistently shows a bimodal (two- peaked) MPC distribution (SI §S3), in contrast to Gaus- sian (single-peak) distributions for conventional spin- textures. Simulations predict distinct, spatially segre- gated spin textures (Fig. 3e-f) in the two component stacks, which should manifest in MFM with different MPCs. Thus, we conclude that higher MPC textures (Fig. 4d: bottom, “A”) form in the top half-stack, while lower MPC textures (Fig. 4d: bottom, “B”) are in the bottom half-stack. Future minor-loop magnetometry- imaging studies of the AFS may shed valuable insights on the formation mechanisms and transitions of SAF-   lations. For FMS (Fig. 5a), skyrmions form near satu- ration (∼100 mT), and dS (∼80 nm) decreases by ∼20% in line with literature5,7. over a narrow field range, Meanwhile, for AFS, dS first decreases over the low- field SAF-coupled regime, then abruptly jumps up for the uncoupled regime (H > Hex), and decreases again to saturation. These AFS and FMS field trends mir- ror those for the MPC amplitudes (Fig. 4c), evidencing their shared origin49. Notably, while AFS and FMS em- ploy identical chiral stacks, the near-ZF SAF skyrmions are directly comparable to FM skyrmions at the highest fields (µ0H ∼ 100 mT). This underscores the profound implications of AF-IEC on skyrmion stability, energet- ics, and kinetics50. Finally, the reported SAF skyrmion sizes compare well with literature36,38–40,43. Future works can explore composite SAF stacks with strongly chiral layers (e.g.,7,47) to develop SAF skyrmions with further reduced size and enhanced stability.   E. Conclusion In summary, we have established a composite multi- layer platform wherein the character and evolution of chiral spin textures is demonstrably modulated by the interplay of stack-tunable AF- and FM-IECs, and by magnetic field. The AFS stack generates robust SAF- coupled skyrmions at ZF, whose internal stray field compensation results in strongly diminished contrast compared to FM textures. Strikingly, the internal effec- tive field from AF-IEC ensures that the SAF skyrmions   coupled and uncoupled textures22,51,57. Finally, we compare in Fig. 5 the evolution of average skyrmion size, dS(H) for AFS and FMS samples (details in SI §S3). The two stacks exhibit distinct trends, with qualitative consistency between experiments and simu-   presented   realization   at ZF are compact, with sizes comparable to FM coun- terparts at over 100 mT. Moreover, the composite stack decouples above the AF-IEC field (Hex), yielding indi- vidual, spatially segregated spin-textures in each half- stack. The SAF-coupled ZF skyrmions with reduced size and enhanced stability has immediate relevance to devices employing skyrmions and beyond. First, while skyrmions in bilayer SAFs exhibit fast, linear motion43, there are inevitable fluc- tuations in properties due to their bubble-like nature. In contrast, compact SAF skyrmions – strengthened additionally by FM-IEC50 – should be endowed with greater resilience to perturbations24. This should en- able more coherent and robust dynamics with racetrack devices2,58. Second, uniform SAF stacks are being increasingly explored as the active layer for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with enhanced immunity59. Incorporating a SAF skyrmion stack within two- terminal MTJs can enable multiple, robust electrical states, with facile manipulation13. Lastly, the hitherto unexplored skyrmion coupling crossover (H ∼ Hex), governed by AF- and FM-IECs36,50, presents a rich, tunable spin-texture phase space29,31,60,61. The ability to propagate quasi-independent skyrmions in each layer, or to control propagation in one layer via the other, offers lucrative prospects for stacked racetracks. Such devices may be employed for reconfigurable logic and unconventional computing2, in particular within probabilistic and reservoir architectures62.   respectively.   F. Methods Film Deposition. Multilayer thin films were de- posited on thermally oxidized Si/SiO2 wafers by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature with base pressure of 2×10−8 Torr, using a Chiron™ PVD sys- tem manufactured by Bestec GmbH7,22. The pri- mary stacks studied have compositions: Ta(3)/Pt(5) / [Ir(1)/Fe(0.2)/Co(1)/Pt(0.8)]3 / Co(1)/Ir(tIr)/Co(1) / [Pt(0.8)/Ir(1)/Fe(0.2)/Co(1)]3 / Pt(3), with tIr= Bilayer 0.5 (AFS) and 1.0 (FMS) [Ir(tIr)/Co(1)/Pt(1)]2 stacks, used to determine AF- IEC (Fig. 1), were deposited using identical buffer and capping layers. Finally, 1/2-FMS and 1/2-AFS stacks were fabricated by etching the primary stacks with pre- cise end-point detection (see SI §S1). Magnetometry. M (H) loops were measured on diced samples using a MicroMag™ alternating gradient mag- netometer. The measured magnetic properties of all stacks are detailed in SI §S1, and consistent with our previous works22,47. MFM Experiments were performed using a Bruker Dimension Icon™ 3100 atomic force microscope, using Co-alloy coated SSS-MFMR tips from NanoSensors™   (magnetization ∼80 emu/cm3, diameter ∼30 nm). Be- fore each imaging dataset, the tip was re-magnetized, Phase- and the sample was negatively saturated. contrast MFM images were acquired at each OP field with tip-lift of 20 nm, and repeated ∼3 times over the same field-of-view to rule out tip-induced perturbations. Quantitative MPC Analysis was performed on a dataset acquired entirely using the same tip, with iden- tical scan conditions across four samples for varying bias fields (Fig. 4, SI §S3). Great care was taken to avoid any changes to the MFM tip through the dataset, which would affect the MPC, and preclude quantitative comparisons. Similarly rigorous validation experiments were performed for multiple samples, including with co- located half- and full stacks (SI §S4). After processing the MFM images, spin-textures were individually iden- tified and fit using established recipes to determine their MPC amplitude and width (Fig. 4, SI §S3). Micromagnetic Simulations were performed using the mumax3 software package63 with a 2 nm mesh over a 2 µm-sized grid. The effective medium model8 was used to simulate reduced stacks with six magnetic lay- ers L1-L6 (Fig. 3a), modelled upon experimental stacks. The simulated stacks used magnetic parameters from measurements (see SI §S1) and related prior works on similar Ir/Fe/Co/Pt stacks47,50,52,with slight optimiza- tion of Keff . Established simulation recipes were used to generate the layer-wise magnetization profile with vary- ing OP field22,47,63. IECs between successive FMs were modelled using three distinct parameters to emulate different HM spac- ers – η2 for Ir(1)/Pt(1); η1 for Pt(0.8), and ηFM/AF for the Ir(tIr). Initial estimates for IECs used measured values for similar multilayers36,50. These values were optimized based on hysteresis loops, resulting in η1 = 0.40 mJ/m2, η2 = 0.28 mJ/m2, ηFM= +0.0535 mJ/m2 and ηAF = -0.535 mJ/m2.",

         "Over the past years, rapid progress has been made on soft‐matter electronics for wearable and implantable devices, for bioelectronics and optogenetics. Liquid Metal (LM) based electronics are especially popular, due to their long‐term durability, when subject to repetitive strain cycles. However, one major limitation has been the need for tethering bioelectronics circuits to external power, or the use of rigid bulky batteries. This has motivated a growing interest in wireless energy transfer, which demands circuit miniaturization. However, miniaturization of LM circuits is challenging due to low LM‐substrate adhesion, LM smearing, and challenges on microchip‐interfacing. In this article, these challenges are addressed by high‐resolution laser‐assisted micropatterning of biphasic LM composites and vapor‐assisted LM microchip soldering. Through the development of a search algorithm for optimization of the biphasic ink coil performance, micro coils with trace spacing of 50 µm are designed and implemented that can harvest a significant amount of energy (178 mW cm−2) through near field inductive coupling. Miniaturized soft‐matter circuits with integrated SMD chips such as NFC chips, capacitors, and LEDs that are implemented in a few minutes through laser patterning, and vapor‐assisted soldering. In the context of optogenetics, where lightweight, miniaturized systems are needed to provide optical stimulation, soft coils stand out in terms of their improved conformability and flexibility. Thus, this article explores the applications of soft coils in wearable and implantable devices, with a specific focus on their use in optogenetics.",

Liquid Metal (LM) based electronics were especially popular, due\nto their long-term durability, when subject to repetitive strain cycles. However, one major limitation has been\nthe need for tethering bioelectronics circuits to external power, or the use of rigid bulky batteries. This has\nmotivated  a growing interest in wireless energy transfer, which demands circuit miniaturization. However,\nminiaturization of LM circuits is challenging due to low LM-substrate adhesion, LM smearing, and challenges\non  microchip-interfacing.  In  this  article,  we  address  these  challenges  by  high-resolution  laser-assisted\nmicropatterning of biphasic LM composites and vapor-assisted LM microchip soldering. Through development\nof a search algorithm for optimization of the biphasic ink coil performance, we designed and implemented\nmicro coils with trace spacing of 50 µm that can harvest a significant amount of energy (178 mW/cm2) through\nnear field inductive coupling. We show miniaturized soft-matter circuits with integrated SMD chips such as\nNFC chips, capacitors, and LEDs that are implemented in a few minutes through laser patterning, and vapor-\nassisted  soldering.  In the  context  of  optogenetics,  where  lightweight,  miniaturized  systems  are  needed  to\nprovide optical stimulation, soft coils stand out in terms of their improved conformability and flexibility. Thus,\nthis article explores the applications of soft coils in wearable and implantable devices, with a specific focus on\ntheir use in optogenetics.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nKeywords: soft electronics, soft fabrication, wearables, wireless power harvesting, optogenetics\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nIntroduction\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn recent years, the field of wearable and implantable devices has witnessed significant advancements, revolutionizing\nthe monitoring and treatment of individuals1 4, as well as enabling groundbreaking discoveries in animal studies5 7. However,\na common challenge faced by these devices is the issue of tethering or reliance on bulky batteries, which often hinders their\nusability and convenience8. This limitation has sparked immense interest in the realm of energy harvesting solutions, motivating\nresearch on energy harvesting from light9 11, mechanical motion through piezoelectric or triboelectric devices12 14, or far field\nantennas15. Among these approaches, the use of magnetic resonance for energy transfer has garnered significant attention due\nto its superior power output and the fact that it is not dependent on external light or mechanical pressure16. While magnetic\nresonance coupling is typically performed at short distances, recent studies17 have demonstrated the potential to extend the\nrange of power transfer to a few meters.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nPrevious works have  focused on flexible circuits with  copper-based conductors to produce the coils necessary  for\nenergy  harvesting.  However,  the  next  generation  of  wearable,  and  especially  implantable  devices,  demand  soft-matter\nelectronics, with stiffness close to that of human organs. If these soft-matter circuits are as well stretchable, they can deal with\nthe strain applied to them due to the dynamic morphology of the human organs, accommodating the mechanical deformations\nexperienced during daily movements1. Although copper/Au serpentine-shaped circuits18 have shown some degree of flexibility,\nand high electrical conductivity, challenges remain such as fabrication difficulties, the need for clean room lithography, limited\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWithin  the  broader  context  of  soft  coil  applications,  this  article  places  special  emphasis  on  a  specific  scenario:\nOptogenetics. Optogenetics has risen to prominence as a potent new paradigm for understanding how neurons connect and give\nrise to more complex brain functions. This enabled rapid scientific progress, leading to the belief that direct clinical use of this\ntechnology  is  forthcoming,  potentially  leading  to  improved  treatments  for  a  variety  of  neurological  illnesses.21  Recent\napplications of optogenetics in neuroscience involve manipulating or monitoring electrophysiological functions and disease\nmodels,22,23 pacing the heart24 or treatment of bladder dysfunctions.7\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nConventional means for delivering light to targeted regions in behaving animals uses optical fibers.24 They are inserted\nusing stereotactic equipment, and external fixtures, surgical glues, cement, and sutures are used to hold them in place. 25 27\nHowever, the high moduli, stiff materials used in these systems are fundamentally mismatched with the soft, compliant tissues\nof  the  brain  and  peripheral  nerves.28  Micromotions  brought  on  by  mechanical  forces  transmitted  through  the  related\nhardware29,30 as well as those resulting from natural, biological movements can degrade the biotic/abiotic interface by causing\ncellular damage and the formation of glial scars.31 The tethers inevitably affect the animals by restricting their range of motion\nand altering their behaviours in ways difficult to quantify, which hinders the reproducibility of the investigations and clouds\nthe interpretation of the data obtained.24 As a replacement for tethered and battery-operated devices, the possibilities of wireless,\nbattery-free and fully implantable devices have recently been explored7,15. The result is lightweight neural interfaces with small\nform factors that enable long-term functionality and better mechanical adaptation to soft neural tissue28 . However, to provide\nsome degree of stretchability to the devices, recent approaches still rely on deterministic circuit architectures, such as serpentine\ngeometries. The natural body motion of a mouse can lead to compression and elongations up to 60% on implanted devices32.\nStill, the serpentine probe of the head-mounted devices32 developed recently sustains stretching only up to 30%. Moreover,\ntheir fabrication process requires expensive cleanroom lithography with over ten fabrication steps19.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTo wirelessly power an optogenetic stimulator different types of wireless energy harvesting strategies are available\nsuch  as  ultrasound33,  far-field  RF  radiation  (frequency  of  2.4  GHz)15,34,  or  near-field  power  transfer,  such  as  magnetic\nresonance35,36.  This  article   focus  is  on  magnetic  resonance,  since  with  high-quality  factor  (Q)  resonators,  efficient  power\ntransfer can be  accomplished over longer distances  (up to  a few meters)16,17. Moreover, within  the frequency range of 100\nkHz37,38 to 200 MHz39 , the harvested energy is little affected\n, as well as\nby the existence of obstructions, thanks to the non-radiative nature of the harvesting technique. This is true even when the line\nof  sight  between  the  two  resonators  is  entirely  blocked16. A more  broader  use  case  for  wearable  wirelessly  powered\nbioelectronics would be its application in the clinical setting for neuromodulation, where one can consider a device that works\nby magnetic resonance at close  range. Thus,  the energy requirements differ from  the application in long-range optogenetic\nstudies, given that in the latter  the  magnetic resonance principle has  to  be extended to allow a larger distance between the\nreceiver and transmitter antennas on the outside of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncages8,32.\nGiven the need of interfacing biological tissues in both of the applications mentioned, recent progress has been made\nin the direction of achieving better conformability and comfort, thus enhanced biocompatibility. In light of this, one can think\nof implants composed not only  by soft polymers in the dielectric encapsulation layers, but also soft electrically conductive\npolymers as the basis of the electrical circuitry, thus achieving what we term\nTo accomplish this, it is\nnecessary to  develop  \"soft  coils,\"  i.e.,  coils  that  are  not  made  of  rigid  conductor  materials  such  as  copper, but  of  soft  and\nstretchable inks.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLithography-free  approaches  have  been  explored  for  the  rapid  prototyping  of  flexible  and  stretchable  electronics.\nThese include the use of nanowires, which provide stretchability and mechanical durability while avoiding complex fabrication\nprocesses40.  However,  nanowires  can  suffer  from  long-term  stability  issues,  such  as  oxidation  or  fatigue  under  repeated\nmechanical  stress,  which  may  limit  their  reliability41.  Metal  nanoparticles  are  another  option,  enabling  high-conductivity\ncircuits with simple processing techniques, though they may require additional steps for stability and integration42. Moreover,\nmetal nanoparticles can exhibit issues like agglomeration, which can degrade their electrical performance over time, and their\nrelatively  low  mechanical  robustness  may  limit  their  use  in  highly  deformable  applications43.  Additionally,  conducting\npolymers 44 present a flexible and stretchable alternative, providing ease of fabrication, although their conductivity often falls\nshort compared to metallic conductors. While each of these approaches has its merits, the biphasic liquid metal-based ink used\nin this work and on refs.19,20,45 offers an advantageous combination of ease of patterning, high conductivity, and mechanical\nadaptability, overcoming many of the limitations found in previous methods.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOne promising approach is the use of a composite of Eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) with stretchable polymers,\nwhich  provides  both  high  electrical  conductivity  and  mechanical  deformability19,20,45.  Renowned  for  its  high  electrical\nconductivity and unique liquid form at room temperature, EGaIn offers several advantages for the realization of soft electronics.\nHowever, due to its liquid phase, EGaIn is difficult to deposit, and pattern, and is smearing to touch.46 Seminal works on laser\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npatterning and laser sintering of liquid metals47,48, were followed by higher resolution patterning49 for visually imperceptible\nelectrodes.  Still,  as  the  LM  is  smearing  and  can  easily  cause  short  circuits,  achieving  a  high  patterning  resolution  in  ref.49\nrequired multiple steps of metal deposition and patterning and access to clean room lithography. On the other hand, electrical\nconductivity limitations are often observed in liquid metal-based materials for antenna applications, prior research has focused\non the fabrication of thick metal layers to reduce sheet resistance and thereby enhance overall performance50 52. These studies\nillustrate that increasing the thickness of the metal layer is an effective strategy for overcoming the intrinsic low conductivity\nof liquid metals. However, increasing the thickness of the metal layer can be a problem for liquid metal-free printed coils due\nto natural deformations on the body, which can compromise their long-term durability. Furthermore, methods based on liquid\nmetal selective wetting on Cu/Au seed layers50,53 have enabled high resolution liquid metal based stretchable circuits. However,\nthere is a limitation on the achievable circuit thickness, as the thickness of the deposited liquid metal depends on the width of\nthe seed trace, thus reducing the control over the applied liquid metal thickness. The trace thickness and resolution are as well\nlimited due to the high probability of short circuits between the adjacent liquid metal traces, which is further problematic during\nmicrochip interfacing. Therefore, liquid metal wetting techniques are not yet able to simultaneously achieve high resolution\npatterning, high trace thickness, and reliable microchip interfacing. On the other hand, the techniques developed in this work\nnot  only  address  these  problems,  they as  well  eliminates  the  need  for  clean  room  deposition  and  lithography,  and  manual\ndeposition processes, such as liquid metal wetting or HCl vapour for SMDs interfacing, making it lower-cost, more scalable\nand more reproducible compared to previous works.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe previously developed versions of digitally printable biphasic composites based on liquid metal and conductive\nsilver composites which have been extensively discussed in ref.19,20,45 The digital printing technique enables rapid fabrication\nof  biphasic  ink  composites,  offering  a  cost-effective  and  customizable  approach  to  circuit  production.  Despite  these\nadvancements, there are still challenges that need to be addressed to achieve a fully integrated and battery-free circuit with\noptimized performance. The resolution of current digital printing techniques may not be sufficient to develop compact circuits\nrequired for miniaturized applications. Advancements in rapid laser patterning of liquid metal composites with metal nanowires\nhave improved mechanical stability and electrical conductivity. Recent research40,54 has also demonstrated enhanced electrical\nperformance and flexibility through the integration of these materials. Other studies 55 reveal high-resolution laser-patterning\ntechniques that maintain mechanical integrity. Moreover, laser patterning stands out53,56,57, as a technique for high-resolution\npatterning. However, implementation of wireless optogenetic devices demands for a combination of high-resolution patterning,\nmicrochip integration, and high conductivity traces, which remains a challenge.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn this work, by combining the use of biphasic liquid metal-based composites, high-resolution laser patterning, and\nthe  vapor-soldering  technique19, we  demonstrate  miniaturized  hybrid  circuits  based  on  liquid  metal,  that  can  be  used  for\noptogenetics  applications.  This  research  focuses  on  rapid  prototyping  of  soft-matter  coils  for  energy  harvesting  through\nmagnetic resonance coupling. To afford the desired low stiffness and stretchability for the circuits, we use a highly stretchable\nand digitally printable biphasic liquid metal-based conductive composite20,58. Liquid metals, including Eutectic Gallium Indium\n(EGaIn) have proven to provide the best trade-off between electrical conductivity and mechanical deformability. Using digital\nfabrication  techniques  such  as  laser  patterning,  we  demonstrate  simultaneous  fabrication  of coils  along  with  other  parts  of\ncircuits in minutes and with accessible equipment, resulting in cost-effective and rapid implementation of customized circuits\nthat can be adapted according to the user and application19,20.  This work builds over these previous works, by patterning a\nbiphasic ink that, despite containing liquid metal, has a non-smearing behaviour and therefore its deposition and patterning is\nstraightforward. Moreover, it is as well demonstrated interfacing miniaturized surface mount silicon chips, that are necessary\nfor  functional  energy-autonomous  implants  capable  of  harvesting  power  from  their  surroundings  through  wireless  power\ntransfer38. We also investigate the optimal geometry to maximize energy harvesting, given the maximum patterning resolution,\nconductivity of the biphasic ink and minimizing its overall size due to the space restrictions associated with implantable devices.\nThis article outlines the methodology for fabricating these soft coils, evaluates their performance, and discusses the\nchallenges  and  future  directions  for  integrating  fully  autonomous,  wireless  energy-harvesting  systems  in  wearable  and\nimplantable bioelectronic devices.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.9**\nResults\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFabrication of soft circuits with integrated energy harvesting coil and microchip assembly. In order to fabricate the battery-\nfree  soft  circuit  with  integrated  microchip,  three  main  steps  should  be  performed:  deposition  and  patterning  of  the  soft\nconductive circuit, integration of the SMD components, and encapsulation of the circuit with a biocompatible polymer.  Figure\n2A summarizes this process. Here we use a biphasic EGaIn-Ag composite previously developed by our team20 as the conductive\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nink.  As patterning options, various methods exist such as extrusion printing, laser patterning, or stencil printing. Previously we\ndemonstrated that the ink can be digitally printed through extrusion printing 20. While this permits rapid additive manufacturing\nof circuits, the printing resolution of ~300µm (trace width and spacing) is limited for miniaturized coils7,15. Therefore, we used\na laser patterning technique in order to obtain more compact coils. This permitted improving the resolution significantly to\ntrace widths of 150 µm and spacing between turns of 50 µm, and consequently fitting more coil turns in the limited space.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTwo similar biphasic EGaIn-Ag composite inks were used. These composite inks were studied in the articles20,51,\nthey have only a difference in the polymer used as substrate. The AgEgaIn-TPU (up to ~1.08×10^6 S/m),  was also employed\nin  this  study  due  to  its  slightly  higher  electrical  conductivity  than  AgEgaIn-SIS  (up  to  ~4.56×10^5  S/m),  which  may  be\ntoluene59,60. This results in\nbetter packing of the composite, thus improved percolation.  However, the SIS based ink has an already proven good reliable\nperformance  on  the  gluing  of  the  chip-pad  interface19,  which  is  expected  since  the  SIS  hyperelastic  binder,  has  excellent\nadhesive  properties.  Therefore,  as  we  showed  in  previous  works,  when  the  circuits  are  subjected  to  the  solvent-assisted\nsoldering process, the substrate fuses with ink, which in turn glues the chip's pad to the circuit, all due to the SIS phase transition.\nThe process starts with the application of a thin  sacrificial film of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (~300 µm) on a flat\nsurface, such as a glass plate, using a thin film applicator (supplementary fig. 1A). This layer serves as the sacrificial layer that\npermits easy circuit release. On top of it, layers of ink are deposited using the same thin-film applicator or a metallic roller with\ntape spacers (supplementary fig. 1B).  We used a Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) fiber laser with Infrared (1064\nnm) wavelength for patterning the circuit (supplementary fig. 1C). This is a low-cost laser system commonly used in print\nshops to engrave metals. As the laser wavelength mostly affects metals, the PVA layer under the ablation area remains intact.\nAfter patterning the circuit, a solution of SIS hyperplastic binder is poured over the patterned circuit, then, after curing and the\ncircuit  is  peeled  off  (supplementary  fig.  1D).  After  dissolving  the  PVA  layer,  the  circuit  is  turned  upside  down  and  SMD\ncomponents are placed using a manual or automatic pick & place machine (supplementary fig. 1E).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe soldering is performed using a vapor-assisted soldering technique recently developed by our team19.  A polymer-\ngel transition is induced on the ink and on the SIS substrate by exposing the circuits to a solvent vapor chamber for 45 min\n(supplementary  fig.  1F).  During  the  gel  state,  the  conductive  pads  of  the  microchip  package  penetrate  and  adhere  to  the\nconductive ink. The bottom side of the package  also adheres to the underlying substrate.  And since the chip penetrates the\nsubstrate, it is completely surrounded on all four sides by the adhesive polymer. Providing at the same time self-soldering and\nself-encapsulation  of  the  electronics.  Finally,  the  circuit  is  encapsulated  by  PDMS,  with  the  help  of  a  3D  printed  mold\n(supplementary fig. 1G).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCoil  design  optimization  and  tuning.  First  showcased  by  Nikola  Tesla61,  near-field  power  transfer  utilizes  non-radiative\nmethod relies on inductive coupling,\nestablishing a connection between a transmitting coil and a receiving coil62. This strategy provides a highly efficient mean of\ntransmitting  power  over  small  distances,  making  it  feasible  for  practical  implementations  in  commercial  contexts  such  as\nwireless charging of electric vehicles63 and powering of consumer electronics64.\nAlthough designed for near range, the efficiency of power transfer and the achievable distance can be substantially improved\nby  utilizing  transmitting  and  receiving  coils  (resonators)  that  are  finely  tuned  to  establish  a  robust  magnetic  resonant\ncoupling16,17. Thus, coil design optimization and tuning to resonate in the same frequency of the transmitter are crucial (13.56\nMHz). In this section, a description of the methodologies followed for the optimization of the coil design, and its subsequent\ntuning, will be laid out.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDesign optimization.   In the context of magnetic resonance, the coil can be regarded as an inductor65,66, thus we can evaluate\nits power harvesting capabilities in terms of its quality factor,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n-factor  of  an  inductor  is  a  measure  of how  close  the  inductor  is  to  an  ideal\ninductor, i.e. one that has no parasitic resistance. As can be seen in fig. 3A, the receiver coil in the fabricated devices can be\ndefined by 5 parameters: overall width, overall length, number of turns, trace width and trace spacing. These parameters and\ntheir relationships define the inductance and resistance of the coil. To optimize them, calculations were performed using the\nformulas from ref.67\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor  wearable\napplications and for implants, on the other hand, we desired them to be as small as possible, to have the minimum possible\nimpact on the body. So, given the size constraint and considering the fabrication resolution limitations, one can optimize design\nparameters of the coil such as number of turns, trace width and trace spacing.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAn exhaustive search algorithm was developed to thoroughly investigate all potential combinations of values for the\nnumber of turns, trace width and trace spacing of the coil. The algorithm systematically assessed the performance of the coil\n(which is reflected in its Q-factor) by rigorously evaluating each possible combination of values in a defined interval of values\nfor trace width and number of turns. The formulas implemented in the code for the inductance and resistance calculations are\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npresent in supplementary formulas 3 and 4. The results were displayed in the form of 2D plots (inductance/resistance/Q-factor\nversus trace width and number of coils) and intensity maps of the best combination of design values. Subsequently, the obtained\ndata  was  analysed  and  visualized  to  gain  insights  into  the  coil's  performance  across  a  range  of  value  combinations.  This\nmethodology enabled a meticulous examination of the parameter space, aiding in the selection of the most suitable design for\nenhanced per\nrace width and\nspacing).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn the search for the optimized values, we imposed conditions such as the exclusion of parameters combinations that\nresulted in: Q values below 25; resistance values above 3 ohms; inductance values below 0.7\nand inner diameters smaller\nthan 2 mm. In the end, all these criteria were combined and evaluated in a single plot (fig.3Bi). To visualize the results of the\nsearch  algorithm,  intensity  maps  and  2D  plots were  created  (figs.3B).    As  one  can  see  in  fig.3Bi  there  is  a  solution  that\nmaximizes the Q-\nQ-value there is a parameter space where the differences in this value are marginal. Thus, a more holistic approach should be\ntaken.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nStarting by the inductance value (fig.3Bii), one can see that it increases with the increase of the number of turns since\nit can concentrate more of the electromagnetic field. On the other hand, maintaining the number of turns fixed, the inductance\ndecreases with the increase of trace width, which can be explained by the fact that the turns get more on the outer contour of\nfill ratio65 67. This insight is of major importance when designing small coils, which\nthe coil, which in turn decreases the coil\ndue to their space constraint have difficulty in achieving high inductance values, thus reducing the trace width helps to improve\nthe Q-value of a coil. However, the trace width can only be reduced to some extent until it stops being beneficial65,67 , because\nof the fact the resistance also increases with its reduction (fig.3Biii). On the other hand, miniaturized coils have the benefit of\nmuch lower trace lengths for the same number of turns when compared to coils of bigger sizes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ns inner diameter, i.e. the empty space inside the coil (measured on\nits last inner turn). This parameter is also associated with the coil fill ratio65 67. This parameter gains substantial importance\nwhen designing miniaturized coils since often it will be the space where the electronics will stay, so depending on the circuit\ncomplexity this space can be adjusted. In fig.3Biv, one can see that, as expected, the increase in the number of turns or the trace\nwidth will always result in an increase i\n-value\nuntil inner diameters of around 1 - 2 mm65 67.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLC resonator tuning. Once the optimum parameters for manufacturing the coils had been found, it was necessary to find the\nright tuning for them. Coil tuning for magnetic resonance refers to the process of matching the electrical properties of the coil\nto the desired resonant frequency 16,17. It involves optimizing the coil's inductance (L) and capacitance (C) values to create a\nresonant LC circuit. Tuning is necessary to maximize the efficiency of the coil. It can be made simply by adding capacitors in\nparallel between the coil and the load16,17.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe exact values of the required capacitance were determined using a vector network analyzer (VNA) by two different\nmethods: direct measurements, where the coil was directly connected to the VNA (figs.3E) and indirect measurements, where\nthe coil was not connected to the VNA, but was placed on top of a copper coil with similar dimensions, being this one connected\nto the VNA (fig.3D).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWith  the  direct  measurements, we  were  able  to  get  the  S11  response  of  the  system  coil  and tuning  capacitors for\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstimulation in optogenetic application)  was  also  added in  parallel. Since  it  can be seen as  a capacitor itself by the coil, its\ncapacitance is also important to ensure the finding of the correct values for the capacitors to be added.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWith the direct measurements we obtained the curve of inductance as a function of frequency (Fig.3Ei) and the curve\nof impedance moduli as a function of frequency (Fig.3Eii). By experimenting with different values for the tuning capacitors,\nthe optimum tuning can be obtained, i.e. when the peak of the curve is at 13.56 MHz, in the case of the curve of the impedance\nmoduli versus frequency. For the case of the inductance versus frequency curve, it is when the point of zero inductance is\naligned with 13.56 MHz, i.e., the point that minimizes the inductive reactance65,66. This method was mainly used for the smaller\ndesigns, as their small factor means that they cannot cause any measurable changes in the magnetic field of the receiver coil,\nwhich is connected to the VNA in the direct measurement method.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nPerformance comparison of copper versus soft coils.

Therefore, achieving the same efficiency of commercial coils with printed coils is very difficult.\nNevertheless, printed coils are attractive due to fabrication advantages, and the possibility of development of soft, and ultrathin\nelectronics that are necessary for wearable and implantable devices.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nA  metric  was  created  to  compare  the  performance  of  the  coils,  named  the  figure-of-merit  of  miniaturization,\n**BLOCK**fs== 6.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nFOMminiaturization:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nBeing L the inductance (µH) and Vpp the peak-to-peak voltage (V).

The resistance represented by R is expressed in ohms.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFOMminiaturization serves as a comparator metric which was designed for finding the best coil design when the physical\nspace (for implantation, in this case) is restricted. Three main variables are involved: coil dimension, coil inductance, and coil\nresistance. In an ideal world, one would strive for the largest possible coil given the space limitation, with the highest possible\ninductance  and  lowest  possible  electrical  resistance.  However,  for  example,  when  one  tries  to  improve  the  Q-factor  by\nincreasing the inductance through increasing the number of turns or decreasing the trace width, an inevitable increase in the\nelectrical resistance will happen, which has a negative effect on the Q-factor, hindering the desired gains. The same applies for\nwhen one tries to increase the Q-factor by increasing the overall dimensions of the coil. The size limitation for a coil implanted\n,  ref.32)  is  higher  than  on  its  back  (where  implants  exceeding  200  mm2  have  been\ndemonstrated32), thus, a head-mounted coil will be a lower burden for the mice than a back-implanted one. Hence, a metric was\nneeded for comparison between coils of different sizes. Therefore, the objective of the FOMminiaturization is to highlight which\ncoil designs provide a more efficient power harvesting performance with the smallest possible footprint. The FOMminiaturization\nformula was created so that it values high values for inductance and a peak-to-peak voltage in the same proportion that awards\nlow areas and coil fill ratios, but not overly emphasizes on the resistance. Given that when looking to fabricate liquid metal\nstretchable/deformable  coils,  a  compromise  has  already  been  established  between  electrical  conductivity  and  device\ndeformability.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTo obtain the data of the plots in fig. 4E-G, three setups were used: (fig.4B,4C, 4D). Setup 1 consisted of connecting\na half-bridge circuit connected to the coil to use it as a rectifier to test the response of the coils to different loads. In this setup,\nthe  receiver  coils  were  in  close  contact  with  the  transmitter  coils.  Setup  2  had  the  receiver  coils  directly  connected  to  the\noscilloscope to evaluate the variation of the peak-peak voltage of the AC wave induced by the transmitter coil. Here the distance\nbetween the transmitter and receiver coil was changed with the help of an F-shaped clamp clip and this change in distance was\nmeasured with a laser meter. Setup 3 was broadly similar to experimental setup 2, with the exception that a piece of tissue from\na  C57/BL6  mouse  was  inserted  between  the  transmitter  and  receiver.  This  is  to  simulate  a  case  in  which  the  receiver  is\nimplanted, and the transmitter is placed over the skin as a wearable textile or printed circuit (fig. 4D). Therefore, the implant\ncoil was placed in contact with the tissue.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIf we analyze the graphs, we can first see from Fig. 4E that the ID1 and ID2 antennas were able to achieve a maximum\nharvest power of more than 180 mW. In these measurements, the coils were in close contact with the transmitter coil. Coil ID3\nhas the same design as ID2, so these two coils are useful for analyzing the difference in power harvesting between soft antennas\nand  copper-based  antennas.  The  resistance  of  coil  ID3,  which  was  made  with  conductive  ink,  was\nresistance of its copper counterpart, ID2, was\nSo, although the resistance of the coil was increased by  9 times, ID3\nwas still able to harvest more than 140 mW at its peak. Also, this is ~25% less than the copper coil, it is still a very good value,\nconsidering the fact that the coil is printed using an ink. Various optimizations were performed to achieve a coil with this value\nof electrical resistance. These iterations are listed in the supplementary table 3-5. The improvements that were added to the\nmanufacturing method are also listed there. The coil ID4 had a different design from the one of antennas ID2 and ID3, however,\nit had an inductance (1.37 µH) close to what the antennas ID2 and ID3 had achieved. But, since its coil length was also bigger\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nof around 100 mW, substantially lower than the other three.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn terms of the effects of distance between the transmitter and receiver coil, as one can see in the plot of figure 4F,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nantennas ID1-3 started at the same voltage level ( 21 V), whereas ID4 already started at a lower voltage (\nharvested voltage values seem to have an exponential decay with the distance. After 1.5 cm, none of them demonstrated a peak-\nto-peak voltage above 1.5 V. Which was expected due to the size of the transmitting coil, which was comparable to the ones of\nthe receiving coils.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nRegarding how the fabricated coils are affected by the presence of tissue in close proximity (fig.4G), i.e. the capacity\nto simulate the coil being implanted under the skin and the transmitter coil as wearable on top of it, by analyzing the plot of fig.\n4G is perceptible that between 0.2\n1.2 cm of distance from the transmitter coil, the differences in power harvesting with and\nwithout  tissue  seem  to  be  negligible.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncapabilities. The biggest difference occurred when the tissue was in close contact with both the receiver coil and the transmitter\ncoil. In this case, the receiver coil is only capable of harvesting about 14 V, while the measured voltage without the tissue was\n18 V. This difference is partly due to the fact that the thickness of the tissue did not allow the coils to be as close together as\nis possible when it is not present. Nonetheless, due to the non-radiative nature of magnetic resonant coupling, it was already\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\ndielectric properties as well as by the existence of obstructions16,37,38.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTo  demonstrate  the  capabilities  of  liquid  metal  composite-based  coils  for  wireless  battery-free  optogenetics,  we\nperformed long-range experiments in a 35 x 25 cm cage with a double loop copper coil wrapped around for wireless power\ntransmission (fig. 5E-G). Here we added the concept of multi-agent optogenetic control (illustrated in figure 1), consisting of\nwireless energy transfer in a cage  of mice, where all of the optogenetic implantables can be controlled on-the-fly. That  is,\nmultiple battery-free passi\nthe energy harness by the coils in different locations of the cage are available in figure 5G.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nDiscussion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn  this  work,  we  demonstrated  materials  and  methods  for  rapid  prototyping  of  soft-matter  implantable  coils  for  energy\nharvesting for optogenetic neuromodulation. We used a liquid metal-based ink to achieve a high electrical conductivity, and a\nlaser  patterning  technique  to  achieve  rapid  and  low-cost  prototyping.  Through  several  evolutions  and  optimizations  of  the\nfabrication method (supplementary tables 3-5), it became possible to fabricate soft coils with 150 µm trace widths and 50 µm\ntrace spacings. This permitted the development of smaller circuits. The overall size of the first device produced was reduced to\n1/7 of the first coil produced by digital printing, from  600 mm2 (first prototype) to 78.5 mm2 (final prototype), resulting in\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\na final device smaller than 1 cm2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe improvements achieved in this work on the fabrication method are also of great value for the adaptation of the\ndesigned devices to other applications such as photometry for monitoring neuronal dynamics in the deep brain6,68 and local\ntissue  oximetry  for  continuous  sensing  of  local  haemoglobin  dynamics5.  Other  clinical  applications  in  the  area  of\nneuromodulation for other organs can be as well envisioned, for example, for the application of optogenetics for cardiovascular\nmedicine28,69.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTowards  wireless  optogenetics  for  neuroscience  research.  The  miniaturized  implant  of  fig.  5E  can  be  used  for  wireless\noptogenetic stimulation in behavioral experiments. Its footprint (19 x 11 mm) has dimensions comparable to the ones used in\nref.32 to implant copper-based rigid devices in small mice breeds such as C57BL/6, which are widely used in animal research.\nHowever, the implants developed by ref.32 are fabricated on the basis of rigid conductors such as copper and flexible\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsubstrates  such  as  polyimide  (Dupont  Kapton®,  which  has  a  Young´s  Modulus  of    ~2.5  GPa (ref.70)),\nYoung´s Modulus is  1-10 kPa (ref.71). The use of Cu-based circuits results in devices that lack tolerance to strain and as well\nlack mechanical compliance with the host, making it uncomfortable, thus failing to adapt to the animal body (e.g. mice C57BL/6\nor Balb/c, breeds used predominantly in optogenetics research) much less to their large range of movements. This will inevitably\ncause stress in the animals24,28, which in turn will invalidate the conclusions obtained from the animal experiments conducted.\nOn the other hand, the implants that we developed tackle this challenge through enhanced mechanical performance due to their\nstretchability/deformability, without resorting to lithography techniques which are expensive and require the use of cleanrooms.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of miniaturized liquid metal-based coils being wirelessly powered in\na long-range setting, in a cage with dimensions comparable to those required to perform wireless optogenetics experiments in\nfreely moving mice. Finally, further development will include a probe system with micro-sized LEDs to transmit electricity\nand light into the brain, as in ref.32.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTowards  optogenetic  sacral  neuromodulation.  The  miniaturized  implant  in  fig.  2C  can  be  developed  as  an  optogenetic\nstimulator for sacral neuromodulation in overactive bladder (OAB) patients. This requires a probe, as OAB stimulators are\ntypically  subdermal  and  use  probes  to  conduct  electricity  to  inner  nerves,  making  the  surgery  minimally  invasive72.\nAlternatively, placing the stimulator near the nerves complicates communication and increases invasiveness. For optogenetic\nstimulation, the probe can either conduct electricity to a µLED or use an optical fiber to conduct light. The implant can be\nwirelessly powered and communicate via inductive coupling, requiring the patient to wear a powering patch, or it can have a\nrechargeable battery charged by the patch.

In this case, the liquid metal (Eutectic Gallium-Indium, EGaIn) is fully encapsulated in PDMS,\nrather than being directly embedded in the tissue. Therefore, the primary material to study regarding biocompatibility should\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbe PDMS, which has been extensively researched and shown to have favorable biocompatibility properties for use in biomedical\napplications73. For instance, studies have demonstrated that PDMS exhibits good compatibility with various cell types and is\nwell-tolerated in vivo. However, the potential cytotoxic effects of the liquid metal itself, particularly with prolonged exposure,\nshould not be overlooked as they may pose challenges in the long-term functionality of implantable devices74,75.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.9**\nMethods\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nPVA synthesis: The PVA solution is obtained by mixing 5g of PVA powder (Selvol 125, SEKISU) with 50 mL of H2O.

The ink is prepared by first dissolving SIS block copolymers (15 wt % SIS) in\na toluene solution and mixing it in a planetary mixer (30 min at 500 rpm). For each 5g of BCP solution, 6.2g of Ag flakes (Silflake 071 Technic Inc.) were\nadded.  However,  the  proportion  of  EGaIn:Ag  was  varied,  and  tests  using  ratios  of  1,  2,  and  4  were  made  in  an  attempt  to  incre\nconductivity. The EGaIn solution was prepared by mixing 75.5 wt% Gallium and 24.5 wt% Indium and letting it naturally dissolve for  12 hours. After the\naddition of Ag and EGaIn, the solution goes again to the planetary mixer for 3 min at 2000 rpm.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTPU-based inks fabrication: The AgEGaIn-TPU ink was synthesized by mixing EGaIn, Ag micro-flakes, and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), instead of\nSIS. The first step of the ink synthesis is dissolving the TPU filament (Ninjaflex TPU 1.75mm 3DNF0817510). A mix of tetrahydrofuran (THF, Sigma Aldrich)\nwith dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma Aldrich) is used as solvent, and the ratio between 2-mTHF and n-DMF is 4:1. The dissolution of TPU filament (15 wt\n% TPU) in THF:DMF takes roughly about 4 days at ambient conditions if one just let it dissolve naturally. For each 1 g of TPU solution, one must add 1.75 g\nof Ag micro-flakes and 1.75 g of EGaIn. Initially, every time a component was added, the solution would go to the mixer (3 min at 2000 rpm). However, when\nthe solution only went to the mixer one time (after all components were added), the final ink seemed to be less viscous, thus easier to spread. Hence, this\nmethod was used primarily. Also, the ratio of EGaIn to Ag micro-flakes was 1:1 in the first ink produced,\ndifferent EGaIn:Ag ratios were experimented (more specifically 2:1 and 3:1).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSIS substrate preparation: The SIS solution is prepared by dissolving SIS (Styrene 14%, Sigma Aldrich) in toluene with a ratio of toluene:SIS of 2:1 and\nmixing it for 30 min at 500 rpm.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nPDMS synthesis: The PDMS used was Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning Corporation). For 10 g of PDMS used, 1 g of curing agent is required.

Afterwards, two sheets of\nmetallic tape must be placed on the sides of the glass (supplementary fig. 3.2b). They serve as spacers to then apply 2 or 3 layers of conductive ink with a\nspatula. Between layers, one must let the ink dry in the oven for a few minutes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLaser patterning:  A  thin film  applicator  is used to  apply a thin layer of conductive ink to the  substrate. A  pulsed  fiber laser (1064 nm wavelength) then\nselectively removes the ink to separate the circuit traces. The polymer substrate beneath the ablation area is unharmed since this laser wavelength affects mostly\nmetals. This proves to be a successful technique for creating high-resolution circuits with trace spacings as small as 50µm. The parameters used for ablation\ninvolved hatchings with a line width of 0.01 mm both in 0º and 90º directions, with the marking of the contour. The power of the laser was set to 100%, its\nspeed to 1000 mm/s with a loop count of 10.

Next, copper etching of the\nexposed parts using ferric chloride in a hot plate (AGIMATICN) for 45 min at 40°C. Finally, to strip the rest of the photoresist the fPCB was washed with\nacetone.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nElectronic device components: The RF harvesting module was built with a tuner capacitor and the dynamic NFC-accessible EEPROM (1.8 x 2.6 mm, NTAG5,\nNTP5210,  NXP)  which  provides  internal  AC-DC  rectification,  as  well  as,  user-selectable  fixed  output  voltages.

For the\nrelated  circuitry  components,  such  as  decoupling  capacitors,  LEDs,  and  resistors,  the  0402 package was  selected  to  minimize  the  overall footprint  of  the\ndevices. An SMD red LED (150040RS73240, Wurth Elektronik) was used as the light source in the various device designs, due to its low forward voltage of\n2V.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWireless RF power transmitter: The model CLRC663 plus NFC Frontend Development Kit (OM26630FDK) from NXP was used.

         " Miniaturized liquid metal composite circuits with energy harvesting coils for battery-free bioelectronics and optogenetics   Denis Rocha1, Pedro Lopes1, Paulo Peixoto1, Aníbal de Almeida1, Mahmoud Tavakoli1 1 Soft and Printed Microelectronics Lab, University of Coimbra, Portugal   Over the past years, rapid progress has been made on soft-matter electronics for wearable and implantable devices, for bioelectronics and optogenetics. Liquid Metal (LM) based electronics were especially popular, due to their long-term durability, when subject to repetitive strain cycles. However, one major limitation has been the need for tethering bioelectronics circuits to external power, or the use of rigid bulky batteries. This has motivated  a growing interest in wireless energy transfer, which demands circuit miniaturization. However, miniaturization of LM circuits is challenging due to low LM-substrate adhesion, LM smearing, and challenges on  microchip-interfacing.  In  this  article,  we  address  these  challenges  by  high-resolution  laser-assisted micropatterning of biphasic LM composites and vapor-assisted LM microchip soldering. Through development of a search algorithm for optimization of the biphasic ink coil performance, we designed and implemented micro coils with trace spacing of 50 µm that can harvest a significant amount of energy (178 mW/cm2) through near field inductive coupling. We show miniaturized soft-matter circuits with integrated SMD chips such as NFC chips, capacitors, and LEDs that are implemented in a few minutes through laser patterning, and vapor- assisted  soldering.  In the  context  of  optogenetics,  where  lightweight,  miniaturized  systems  are  needed  to provide optical stimulation, soft coils stand out in terms of their improved conformability and flexibility. Thus, this article explores the applications of soft coils in wearable and implantable devices, with a specific focus on their use in optogenetics.   In recent years, the field of wearable and implantable devices has witnessed significant advancements, revolutionizing the monitoring and treatment of individuals1 4, as well as enabling groundbreaking discoveries in animal studies5 7. However, a common challenge faced by these devices is the issue of tethering or reliance on bulky batteries, which often hinders their usability and convenience8. This limitation has sparked immense interest in the realm of energy harvesting solutions, motivating research on energy harvesting from light9 11, mechanical motion through piezoelectric or triboelectric devices12 14, or far field antennas15. Among these approaches, the use of magnetic resonance for energy transfer has garnered significant attention due to its superior power output and the fact that it is not dependent on external light or mechanical pressure16. While magnetic resonance coupling is typically performed at short distances, recent studies17 have demonstrated the potential to extend the range of power transfer to a few meters.   Previous works have  focused on flexible circuits with  copper-based conductors to produce the coils necessary  for energy  harvesting.  However,  the  next  generation  of  wearable,  and  especially  implantable  devices,  demand  soft-matter electronics, with stiffness close to that of human organs. If these soft-matter circuits are as well stretchable, they can deal with the strain applied to them due to the dynamic morphology of the human organs, accommodating the mechanical deformations experienced during daily movements1. Although copper/Au serpentine-shaped circuits18 have shown some degree of flexibility, and high electrical conductivity, challenges remain such as fabrication difficulties, the need for clean room lithography, limited   Within  the  broader  context  of  soft  coil  applications,  this  article  places  special  emphasis  on  a  specific  scenario: Optogenetics. Optogenetics has risen to prominence as a potent new paradigm for understanding how neurons connect and give rise to more complex brain functions. This enabled rapid scientific progress, leading to the belief that direct clinical use of this technology  is  forthcoming,  potentially  leading  to  improved  treatments  for  a  variety  of  neurological  illnesses.21  Recent applications of optogenetics in neuroscience involve manipulating or monitoring electrophysiological functions and disease models,22,23 pacing the heart24 or treatment of bladder dysfunctions.7   Conventional means for delivering light to targeted regions in behaving animals uses optical fibers.24 They are inserted using stereotactic equipment, and external fixtures, surgical glues, cement, and sutures are used to hold them in place. 25 27 However, the high moduli, stiff materials used in these systems are fundamentally mismatched with the soft, compliant tissues of  the  brain  and  peripheral  nerves.28  Micromotions  brought  on  by  mechanical  forces  transmitted  through  the  related hardware29,30 as well as those resulting from natural, biological movements can degrade the biotic/abiotic interface by causing cellular damage and the formation of glial scars.31 The tethers inevitably affect the animals by restricting their range of motion and altering their behaviours in ways difficult to quantify, which hinders the reproducibility of the investigations and clouds the interpretation of the data obtained.24 As a replacement for tethered and battery-operated devices, the possibilities of wireless, battery-free and fully implantable devices have recently been explored7,15. The result is lightweight neural interfaces with small form factors that enable long-term functionality and better mechanical adaptation to soft neural tissue28 . However, to provide some degree of stretchability to the devices, recent approaches still rely on deterministic circuit architectures, such as serpentine geometries. The natural body motion of a mouse can lead to compression and elongations up to 60% on implanted devices32. Still, the serpentine probe of the head-mounted devices32 developed recently sustains stretching only up to 30%. Moreover, their fabrication process requires expensive cleanroom lithography with over ten fabrication steps19.   To wirelessly power an optogenetic stimulator different types of wireless energy harvesting strategies are available such  as  ultrasound33,  far-field  RF  radiation  (frequency  of  2.4  GHz)15,34,  or  near-field  power  transfer,  such  as  magnetic resonance35,36.  This  article   focus  is  on  magnetic  resonance,  since  with  high-quality  factor  (Q)  resonators,  efficient  power transfer can be  accomplished over longer distances  (up to  a few meters)16,17. Moreover, within  the frequency range of 100 kHz37,38 to 200 MHz39 , the harvested energy is little affected , as well as by the existence of obstructions, thanks to the non-radiative nature of the harvesting technique. This is true even when the line of  sight  between  the  two  resonators  is  entirely  blocked16. A more  broader  use  case  for  wearable  wirelessly  powered bioelectronics would be its application in the clinical setting for neuromodulation, where one can consider a device that works by magnetic resonance at close  range. Thus,  the energy requirements differ from  the application in long-range optogenetic studies, given that in the latter  the  magnetic resonance principle has  to  be extended to allow a larger distance between the receiver and transmitter antennas on the outside of the   cages8,32. Given the need of interfacing biological tissues in both of the applications mentioned, recent progress has been made in the direction of achieving better conformability and comfort, thus enhanced biocompatibility. In light of this, one can think of implants composed not only  by soft polymers in the dielectric encapsulation layers, but also soft electrically conductive polymers as the basis of the electrical circuitry, thus achieving what we term To accomplish this, it is necessary to  develop  \"soft  coils,\"  i.e.,  coils  that  are  not  made  of  rigid  conductor  materials  such  as  copper, but  of  soft  and stretchable inks.   Lithography-free  approaches  have  been  explored  for  the  rapid  prototyping  of  flexible  and  stretchable  electronics. These include the use of nanowires, which provide stretchability and mechanical durability while avoiding complex fabrication processes40.  However,  nanowires  can  suffer  from  long-term  stability  issues,  such  as  oxidation  or  fatigue  under  repeated mechanical  stress,  which  may  limit  their  reliability41.  Metal  nanoparticles  are  another  option,  enabling  high-conductivity circuits with simple processing techniques, though they may require additional steps for stability and integration42. Moreover, metal nanoparticles can exhibit issues like agglomeration, which can degrade their electrical performance over time, and their relatively  low  mechanical  robustness  may  limit  their  use  in  highly  deformable  applications43.  Additionally,  conducting polymers 44 present a flexible and stretchable alternative, providing ease of fabrication, although their conductivity often falls short compared to metallic conductors. While each of these approaches has its merits, the biphasic liquid metal-based ink used in this work and on refs.19,20,45 offers an advantageous combination of ease of patterning, high conductivity, and mechanical adaptability, overcoming many of the limitations found in previous methods.   One promising approach is the use of a composite of Eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) with stretchable polymers, which  provides  both  high  electrical  conductivity  and  mechanical  deformability19,20,45.  Renowned  for  its  high  electrical conductivity and unique liquid form at room temperature, EGaIn offers several advantages for the realization of soft electronics. However, due to its liquid phase, EGaIn is difficult to deposit, and pattern, and is smearing to touch.46 Seminal works on laser   patterning and laser sintering of liquid metals47,48, were followed by higher resolution patterning49 for visually imperceptible electrodes.  Still,  as  the  LM  is  smearing  and  can  easily  cause  short  circuits,  achieving  a  high  patterning  resolution  in  ref.49 required multiple steps of metal deposition and patterning and access to clean room lithography. On the other hand, electrical conductivity limitations are often observed in liquid metal-based materials for antenna applications, prior research has focused on the fabrication of thick metal layers to reduce sheet resistance and thereby enhance overall performance50 52. These studies illustrate that increasing the thickness of the metal layer is an effective strategy for overcoming the intrinsic low conductivity of liquid metals. However, increasing the thickness of the metal layer can be a problem for liquid metal-free printed coils due to natural deformations on the body, which can compromise their long-term durability. Furthermore, methods based on liquid metal selective wetting on Cu/Au seed layers50,53 have enabled high resolution liquid metal based stretchable circuits. However, there is a limitation on the achievable circuit thickness, as the thickness of the deposited liquid metal depends on the width of the seed trace, thus reducing the control over the applied liquid metal thickness. The trace thickness and resolution are as well limited due to the high probability of short circuits between the adjacent liquid metal traces, which is further problematic during microchip interfacing. Therefore, liquid metal wetting techniques are not yet able to simultaneously achieve high resolution patterning, high trace thickness, and reliable microchip interfacing. On the other hand, the techniques developed in this work not  only  address  these  problems,  they as  well  eliminates  the  need  for  clean  room  deposition  and  lithography,  and  manual deposition processes, such as liquid metal wetting or HCl vapour for SMDs interfacing, making it lower-cost, more scalable and more reproducible compared to previous works.   We previously developed versions of digitally printable biphasic composites based on liquid metal and conductive silver composites which have been extensively discussed in ref.19,20,45 The digital printing technique enables rapid fabrication of  biphasic  ink  composites,  offering  a  cost-effective  and  customizable  approach  to  circuit  production.  Despite  these advancements, there are still challenges that need to be addressed to achieve a fully integrated and battery-free circuit with optimized performance. The resolution of current digital printing techniques may not be sufficient to develop compact circuits required for miniaturized applications. Advancements in rapid laser patterning of liquid metal composites with metal nanowires have improved mechanical stability and electrical conductivity. Recent research40,54 has also demonstrated enhanced electrical performance and flexibility through the integration of these materials. Other studies 55 reveal high-resolution laser-patterning techniques that maintain mechanical integrity. Moreover, laser patterning stands out53,56,57, as a technique for high-resolution patterning. However, implementation of wireless optogenetic devices demands for a combination of high-resolution patterning, microchip integration, and high conductivity traces, which remains a challenge.   In this work, by combining the use of biphasic liquid metal-based composites, high-resolution laser patterning, and the  vapor-soldering  technique19, we  demonstrate  miniaturized  hybrid  circuits  based  on  liquid  metal,  that  can  be  used  for optogenetics  applications.  This  research  focuses  on  rapid  prototyping  of  soft-matter  coils  for  energy  harvesting  through magnetic resonance coupling. To afford the desired low stiffness and stretchability for the circuits, we use a highly stretchable and digitally printable biphasic liquid metal-based conductive composite20,58. Liquid metals, including Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) have proven to provide the best trade-off between electrical conductivity and mechanical deformability. Using digital fabrication  techniques  such  as  laser  patterning,  we  demonstrate  simultaneous  fabrication  of coils  along  with  other  parts  of circuits in minutes and with accessible equipment, resulting in cost-effective and rapid implementation of customized circuits that can be adapted according to the user and application19,20.  This work builds over these previous works, by patterning a biphasic ink that, despite containing liquid metal, has a non-smearing behaviour and therefore its deposition and patterning is straightforward. Moreover, it is as well demonstrated interfacing miniaturized surface mount silicon chips, that are necessary for  functional  energy-autonomous  implants  capable  of  harvesting  power  from  their  surroundings  through  wireless  power transfer38. We also investigate the optimal geometry to maximize energy harvesting, given the maximum patterning resolution, conductivity of the biphasic ink and minimizing its overall size due to the space restrictions associated with implantable devices. This article outlines the methodology for fabricating these soft coils, evaluates their performance, and discusses the challenges  and  future  directions  for  integrating  fully  autonomous,  wireless  energy-harvesting  systems  in  wearable  and implantable bioelectronic devices.   Fabrication of soft circuits with integrated energy harvesting coil and microchip assembly. In order to fabricate the battery- free  soft  circuit  with  integrated  microchip,  three  main  steps  should  be  performed:  deposition  and  patterning  of  the  soft conductive circuit, integration of the SMD components, and encapsulation of the circuit with a biocompatible polymer.  Figure 2A summarizes this process. Here we use a biphasic EGaIn-Ag composite previously developed by our team20 as the conductive   ink.  As patterning options, various methods exist such as extrusion printing, laser patterning, or stencil printing. Previously we demonstrated that the ink can be digitally printed through extrusion printing 20. While this permits rapid additive manufacturing of circuits, the printing resolution of ~300µm (trace width and spacing) is limited for miniaturized coils7,15. Therefore, we used a laser patterning technique in order to obtain more compact coils. This permitted improving the resolution significantly to trace widths of 150 µm and spacing between turns of 50 µm, and consequently fitting more coil turns in the limited space.   Two similar biphasic EGaIn-Ag composite inks were used. These composite inks were studied in the articles20,51, they have only a difference in the polymer used as substrate. The AgEgaIn-TPU (up to ~1.08×10^6 S/m),  was also employed in  this  study  due  to  its  slightly  higher  electrical  conductivity  than  AgEgaIn-SIS  (up  to  ~4.56×10^5  S/m),  which  may  be toluene59,60. This results in better packing of the composite, thus improved percolation.  However, the SIS based ink has an already proven good reliable performance  on  the  gluing  of  the  chip-pad  interface19,  which  is  expected  since  the  SIS  hyperelastic  binder,  has  excellent adhesive  properties.  Therefore,  as  we  showed  in  previous  works,  when  the  circuits  are  subjected  to  the  solvent-assisted soldering process, the substrate fuses with ink, which in turn glues the chip's pad to the circuit, all due to the SIS phase transition. The process starts with the application of a thin  sacrificial film of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (~300 µm) on a flat surface, such as a glass plate, using a thin film applicator (supplementary fig. 1A). This layer serves as the sacrificial layer that permits easy circuit release. On top of it, layers of ink are deposited using the same thin-film applicator or a metallic roller with tape spacers (supplementary fig. 1B).  We used a Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) fiber laser with Infrared (1064 nm) wavelength for patterning the circuit (supplementary fig. 1C). This is a low-cost laser system commonly used in print shops to engrave metals. As the laser wavelength mostly affects metals, the PVA layer under the ablation area remains intact. After patterning the circuit, a solution of SIS hyperplastic binder is poured over the patterned circuit, then, after curing and the circuit  is  peeled  off  (supplementary  fig.  1D).  After  dissolving  the  PVA  layer,  the  circuit  is  turned  upside  down  and  SMD components are placed using a manual or automatic pick & place machine (supplementary fig. 1E).   The soldering is performed using a vapor-assisted soldering technique recently developed by our team19.  A polymer- gel transition is induced on the ink and on the SIS substrate by exposing the circuits to a solvent vapor chamber for 45 min (supplementary  fig.  1F).  During  the  gel  state,  the  conductive  pads  of  the  microchip  package  penetrate  and  adhere  to  the conductive ink. The bottom side of the package  also adheres to the underlying substrate.  And since the chip penetrates the substrate, it is completely surrounded on all four sides by the adhesive polymer. Providing at the same time self-soldering and self-encapsulation  of  the  electronics.  Finally,  the  circuit  is  encapsulated  by  PDMS,  with  the  help  of  a  3D  printed  mold (supplementary fig. 1G).   Coil  design  optimization  and  tuning.  First  showcased  by  Nikola  Tesla61,  near-field  power  transfer  utilizes  non-radiative method relies on inductive coupling, establishing a connection between a transmitting coil and a receiving coil62. This strategy provides a highly efficient mean of transmitting  power  over  small  distances,  making  it  feasible  for  practical  implementations  in  commercial  contexts  such  as wireless charging of electric vehicles63 and powering of consumer electronics64. Although designed for near range, the efficiency of power transfer and the achievable distance can be substantially improved by  utilizing  transmitting  and  receiving  coils  (resonators)  that  are  finely  tuned  to  establish  a  robust  magnetic  resonant coupling16,17. Thus, coil design optimization and tuning to resonate in the same frequency of the transmitter are crucial (13.56 MHz). In this section, a description of the methodologies followed for the optimization of the coil design, and its subsequent tuning, will be laid out.   Design optimization.   In the context of magnetic resonance, the coil can be regarded as an inductor65,66, thus we can evaluate its power harvesting capabilities in terms of its quality factor,   -factor  of  an  inductor  is  a  measure  of how  close  the  inductor  is  to  an  ideal inductor, i.e. one that has no parasitic resistance. As can be seen in fig. 3A, the receiver coil in the fabricated devices can be defined by 5 parameters: overall width, overall length, number of turns, trace width and trace spacing. These parameters and their relationships define the inductance and resistance of the coil. To optimize them, calculations were performed using the formulas from ref.67   For  wearable applications and for implants, on the other hand, we desired them to be as small as possible, to have the minimum possible impact on the body. So, given the size constraint and considering the fabrication resolution limitations, one can optimize design parameters of the coil such as number of turns, trace width and trace spacing.   An exhaustive search algorithm was developed to thoroughly investigate all potential combinations of values for the number of turns, trace width and trace spacing of the coil. The algorithm systematically assessed the performance of the coil (which is reflected in its Q-factor) by rigorously evaluating each possible combination of values in a defined interval of values for trace width and number of turns. The formulas implemented in the code for the inductance and resistance calculations are   present in supplementary formulas 3 and 4. The results were displayed in the form of 2D plots (inductance/resistance/Q-factor versus trace width and number of coils) and intensity maps of the best combination of design values. Subsequently, the obtained data  was  analysed  and  visualized  to  gain  insights  into  the  coil's  performance  across  a  range  of  value  combinations.  This methodology enabled a meticulous examination of the parameter space, aiding in the selection of the most suitable design for enhanced per race width and spacing).   In the search for the optimized values, we imposed conditions such as the exclusion of parameters combinations that resulted in: Q values below 25; resistance values above 3 ohms; inductance values below 0.7 and inner diameters smaller than 2 mm. In the end, all these criteria were combined and evaluated in a single plot (fig.3Bi). To visualize the results of the search  algorithm,  intensity  maps  and  2D  plots were  created  (figs.3B).    As  one  can  see  in  fig.3Bi  there  is  a  solution  that maximizes the Q- Q-value there is a parameter space where the differences in this value are marginal. Thus, a more holistic approach should be taken.   Starting by the inductance value (fig.3Bii), one can see that it increases with the increase of the number of turns since it can concentrate more of the electromagnetic field. On the other hand, maintaining the number of turns fixed, the inductance decreases with the increase of trace width, which can be explained by the fact that the turns get more on the outer contour of fill ratio65 67. This insight is of major importance when designing small coils, which the coil, which in turn decreases the coil due to their space constraint have difficulty in achieving high inductance values, thus reducing the trace width helps to improve the Q-value of a coil. However, the trace width can only be reduced to some extent until it stops being beneficial65,67 , because of the fact the resistance also increases with its reduction (fig.3Biii). On the other hand, miniaturized coils have the benefit of much lower trace lengths for the same number of turns when compared to coils of bigger sizes.   s inner diameter, i.e. the empty space inside the coil (measured on its last inner turn). This parameter is also associated with the coil fill ratio65 67. This parameter gains substantial importance when designing miniaturized coils since often it will be the space where the electronics will stay, so depending on the circuit complexity this space can be adjusted. In fig.3Biv, one can see that, as expected, the increase in the number of turns or the trace width will always result in an increase i -value until inner diameters of around 1 - 2 mm65 67.   LC resonator tuning. Once the optimum parameters for manufacturing the coils had been found, it was necessary to find the right tuning for them. Coil tuning for magnetic resonance refers to the process of matching the electrical properties of the coil to the desired resonant frequency 16,17. It involves optimizing the coil's inductance (L) and capacitance (C) values to create a resonant LC circuit. Tuning is necessary to maximize the efficiency of the coil. It can be made simply by adding capacitors in parallel between the coil and the load16,17.   The exact values of the required capacitance were determined using a vector network analyzer (VNA) by two different methods: direct measurements, where the coil was directly connected to the VNA (figs.3E) and indirect measurements, where the coil was not connected to the VNA, but was placed on top of a copper coil with similar dimensions, being this one connected to the VNA (fig.3D).   With  the  direct  measurements, we  were  able  to  get  the  S11  response  of  the  system  coil  and tuning  capacitors for   stimulation in optogenetic application)  was  also  added in  parallel. Since  it  can be seen as  a capacitor itself by the coil, its capacitance is also important to ensure the finding of the correct values for the capacitors to be added.   With the direct measurements we obtained the curve of inductance as a function of frequency (Fig.3Ei) and the curve of impedance moduli as a function of frequency (Fig.3Eii). By experimenting with different values for the tuning capacitors, the optimum tuning can be obtained, i.e. when the peak of the curve is at 13.56 MHz, in the case of the curve of the impedance moduli versus frequency. For the case of the inductance versus frequency curve, it is when the point of zero inductance is aligned with 13.56 MHz, i.e., the point that minimizes the inductive reactance65,66. This method was mainly used for the smaller designs, as their small factor means that they cannot cause any measurable changes in the magnetic field of the receiver coil, which is connected to the VNA in the direct measurement method.   Performance comparison of copper versus soft coils. For the evaluation of the performance of copper versus soft coil, four coils  were  selected  from  supplementary  table  2.  The  coils  selected  were  the  ID1,  ID2,  ID3,  and  ID4  (fig.4A).  ID1  is  a race race   race race   race spacing and overall size of 13 x 7.6 mm.   The antennas ID1 and ID2 were selected as high-performance counterparts for comparison with the best soft antennas ~7.02 × 105 Sm-1 which is   <80× compared to the copper. Therefore, achieving the same efficiency of commercial coils with printed coils is very difficult. Nevertheless, printed coils are attractive due to fabrication advantages, and the possibility of development of soft, and ultrathin electronics that are necessary for wearable and implantable devices.   A  metric  was  created  to  compare  the  performance  of  the  coils,  named  the  figure-of-merit  of  miniaturization,   Being L the inductance (µH) and Vpp the peak-to-peak voltage (V). The A represents the area (mm2   fill ratio. The resistance represented by R is expressed in ohms.   FOMminiaturization serves as a comparator metric which was designed for finding the best coil design when the physical space (for implantation, in this case) is restricted. Three main variables are involved: coil dimension, coil inductance, and coil resistance. In an ideal world, one would strive for the largest possible coil given the space limitation, with the highest possible inductance  and  lowest  possible  electrical  resistance.  However,  for  example,  when  one  tries  to  improve  the  Q-factor  by increasing the inductance through increasing the number of turns or decreasing the trace width, an inevitable increase in the electrical resistance will happen, which has a negative effect on the Q-factor, hindering the desired gains. The same applies for when one tries to increase the Q-factor by increasing the overall dimensions of the coil. The size limitation for a coil implanted ,  ref.32)  is  higher  than  on  its  back  (where  implants  exceeding  200  mm2  have  been demonstrated32), thus, a head-mounted coil will be a lower burden for the mice than a back-implanted one. Hence, a metric was needed for comparison between coils of different sizes. Therefore, the objective of the FOMminiaturization is to highlight which coil designs provide a more efficient power harvesting performance with the smallest possible footprint. The FOMminiaturization formula was created so that it values high values for inductance and a peak-to-peak voltage in the same proportion that awards low areas and coil fill ratios, but not overly emphasizes on the resistance. Given that when looking to fabricate liquid metal stretchable/deformable  coils,  a  compromise  has  already  been  established  between  electrical  conductivity  and  device deformability.   To obtain the data of the plots in fig. 4E-G, three setups were used: (fig.4B,4C, 4D). Setup 1 consisted of connecting a half-bridge circuit connected to the coil to use it as a rectifier to test the response of the coils to different loads. In this setup, the  receiver  coils  were  in  close  contact  with  the  transmitter  coils.  Setup  2  had  the  receiver  coils  directly  connected  to  the oscilloscope to evaluate the variation of the peak-peak voltage of the AC wave induced by the transmitter coil. Here the distance between the transmitter and receiver coil was changed with the help of an F-shaped clamp clip and this change in distance was measured with a laser meter. Setup 3 was broadly similar to experimental setup 2, with the exception that a piece of tissue from a  C57/BL6  mouse  was  inserted  between  the  transmitter  and  receiver.  This  is  to  simulate  a  case  in  which  the  receiver  is implanted, and the transmitter is placed over the skin as a wearable textile or printed circuit (fig. 4D). Therefore, the implant coil was placed in contact with the tissue.   If we analyze the graphs, we can first see from Fig. 4E that the ID1 and ID2 antennas were able to achieve a maximum harvest power of more than 180 mW. In these measurements, the coils were in close contact with the transmitter coil. Coil ID3 has the same design as ID2, so these two coils are useful for analyzing the difference in power harvesting between soft antennas and  copper-based  antennas.  The  resistance  of  coil  ID3,  which  was  made  with  conductive  ink,  was resistance of its copper counterpart, ID2, was So, although the resistance of the coil was increased by  9 times, ID3 was still able to harvest more than 140 mW at its peak. Also, this is ~25% less than the copper coil, it is still a very good value, considering the fact that the coil is printed using an ink. Various optimizations were performed to achieve a coil with this value of electrical resistance. These iterations are listed in the supplementary table 3-5. The improvements that were added to the manufacturing method are also listed there. The coil ID4 had a different design from the one of antennas ID2 and ID3, however, it had an inductance (1.37 µH) close to what the antennas ID2 and ID3 had achieved. But, since its coil length was also bigger   of around 100 mW, substantially lower than the other three.   In terms of the effects of distance between the transmitter and receiver coil, as one can see in the plot of figure 4F,   antennas ID1-3 started at the same voltage level ( 21 V), whereas ID4 already started at a lower voltage ( harvested voltage values seem to have an exponential decay with the distance. After 1.5 cm, none of them demonstrated a peak- to-peak voltage above 1.5 V. Which was expected due to the size of the transmitting coil, which was comparable to the ones of the receiving coils.   Regarding how the fabricated coils are affected by the presence of tissue in close proximity (fig.4G), i.e. the capacity to simulate the coil being implanted under the skin and the transmitter coil as wearable on top of it, by analyzing the plot of fig. 4G is perceptible that between 0.2 1.2 cm of distance from the transmitter coil, the differences in power harvesting with and without  tissue  seem  to  be  negligible.   capabilities. The biggest difference occurred when the tissue was in close contact with both the receiver coil and the transmitter coil. In this case, the receiver coil is only capable of harvesting about 14 V, while the measured voltage without the tissue was 18 V. This difference is partly due to the fact that the thickness of the tissue did not allow the coils to be as close together as is possible when it is not present. Nonetheless, due to the non-radiative nature of magnetic resonant coupling, it was already   dielectric properties as well as by the existence of obstructions16,37,38.   To  demonstrate  the  capabilities  of  liquid  metal  composite-based  coils  for  wireless  battery-free  optogenetics,  we performed long-range experiments in a 35 x 25 cm cage with a double loop copper coil wrapped around for wireless power transmission (fig. 5E-G). Here we added the concept of multi-agent optogenetic control (illustrated in figure 1), consisting of wireless energy transfer in a cage  of mice, where all of the optogenetic implantables can be controlled on-the-fly. That  is, multiple battery-free passi the energy harness by the coils in different locations of the cage are available in figure 5G.   In  this  work,  we  demonstrated  materials  and  methods  for  rapid  prototyping  of  soft-matter  implantable  coils  for  energy harvesting for optogenetic neuromodulation. We used a liquid metal-based ink to achieve a high electrical conductivity, and a laser  patterning  technique  to  achieve  rapid  and  low-cost  prototyping.  Through  several  evolutions  and  optimizations  of  the fabrication method (supplementary tables 3-5), it became possible to fabricate soft coils with 150 µm trace widths and 50 µm trace spacings. This permitted the development of smaller circuits. The overall size of the first device produced was reduced to 1/7 of the first coil produced by digital printing, from  600 mm2 (first prototype) to 78.5 mm2 (final prototype), resulting in   a final device smaller than 1 cm2.   The improvements achieved in this work on the fabrication method are also of great value for the adaptation of the designed devices to other applications such as photometry for monitoring neuronal dynamics in the deep brain6,68 and local tissue  oximetry  for  continuous  sensing  of  local  haemoglobin  dynamics5.  Other  clinical  applications  in  the  area  of neuromodulation for other organs can be as well envisioned, for example, for the application of optogenetics for cardiovascular medicine28,69.   Towards  wireless  optogenetics  for  neuroscience  research.  The  miniaturized  implant  of  fig.  5E  can  be  used  for  wireless optogenetic stimulation in behavioral experiments. Its footprint (19 x 11 mm) has dimensions comparable to the ones used in ref.32 to implant copper-based rigid devices in small mice breeds such as C57BL/6, which are widely used in animal research. However, the implants developed by ref.32 are fabricated on the basis of rigid conductors such as copper and flexible   substrates  such  as  polyimide  (Dupont  Kapton®,  which  has  a  Young´s  Modulus  of    ~2.5  GPa (ref.70)), Young´s Modulus is  1-10 kPa (ref.71). The use of Cu-based circuits results in devices that lack tolerance to strain and as well lack mechanical compliance with the host, making it uncomfortable, thus failing to adapt to the animal body (e.g. mice C57BL/6 or Balb/c, breeds used predominantly in optogenetics research) much less to their large range of movements. This will inevitably cause stress in the animals24,28, which in turn will invalidate the conclusions obtained from the animal experiments conducted. On the other hand, the implants that we developed tackle this challenge through enhanced mechanical performance due to their stretchability/deformability, without resorting to lithography techniques which are expensive and require the use of cleanrooms. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of miniaturized liquid metal-based coils being wirelessly powered in a long-range setting, in a cage with dimensions comparable to those required to perform wireless optogenetics experiments in freely moving mice. Finally, further development will include a probe system with micro-sized LEDs to transmit electricity and light into the brain, as in ref.32.   Towards  optogenetic  sacral  neuromodulation.  The  miniaturized  implant  in  fig.  2C  can  be  developed  as  an  optogenetic stimulator for sacral neuromodulation in overactive bladder (OAB) patients. This requires a probe, as OAB stimulators are typically  subdermal  and  use  probes  to  conduct  electricity  to  inner  nerves,  making  the  surgery  minimally  invasive72. Alternatively, placing the stimulator near the nerves complicates communication and increases invasiveness. For optogenetic stimulation, the probe can either conduct electricity to a µLED or use an optical fiber to conduct light. The implant can be wirelessly powered and communicate via inductive coupling, requiring the patient to wear a powering patch, or it can have a rechargeable battery charged by the patch. This work lays the foundation for developing fully soft optogenetic implants for neuromodulati   While the developed devices are promising for optogenetic applications, it is important to address the biocompatibility of the materials used in the implants. In this case, the liquid metal (Eutectic Gallium-Indium, EGaIn) is fully encapsulated in PDMS, rather than being directly embedded in the tissue. Therefore, the primary material to study regarding biocompatibility should   be PDMS, which has been extensively researched and shown to have favorable biocompatibility properties for use in biomedical applications73. For instance, studies have demonstrated that PDMS exhibits good compatibility with various cell types and is well-tolerated in vivo. However, the potential cytotoxic effects of the liquid metal itself, particularly with prolonged exposure, should not be overlooked as they may pose challenges in the long-term functionality of implantable devices74,75.

         "  Ferromagnetism (FM) and superconductivity (SC) are two of the most famous\nmacroscopic quantum phenomena. However, nature normally does not allow SC and\nFM to coexist without significant degradation. Here, we introduce the first\nfully iron-based SC/FM heterostructures, composed of Fe(Te,Se) and Fe3GeTe2,\nand show that in this platform strong FM and high-temperature SC robustly\ncoexist. We subsequently discover that chemical proximity effect from\nneighboring layers can universally drive the otherwise non-superconducting FeTe\nfilms into a SC state. This suggests that the ground state of FeTe is so close\nto the SC state that it could be driven in and out of the SC state with various\nother perturbations. Altogether, this shows that Fe-Te-based heterostructures\nprovide a unique opportunity to manipulate magnetism, superconductivity and\ntopological physics, paving the way toward new superconducting technologies.\n",

The maximal RMS value indicates the largest\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nvariation  of  the  magnetic  stray  field  due  to  the  multi-domain  state,  and  the  corresponding\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmagnetic field is fully consistent with the coercive field Hc, measured with transport in Figure\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthat  there  is,  if  at  all,  very  little  degradation  of  each  of  their  original  properties,  unlike\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconventional  SC/FM  heterostructures,  where  superconducting  Tc  always  degrades  due  to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimplies that the effect of disorder is minimal in this system and that SC properties of the FTS\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlayer are robust against coupling with the FM order. On the other hand, however, it raises the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nquestion of whether there is any proximity coupling between FTS and FGT. To address this\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nquestion, we synthesized a simpler, Se-free, FeTe/FGT heterostructure, which is supposed to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbe  non-superconducting.    It  has  long  been  the  general  consensus  that  FeTe,  the  Te-rich\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nendmember  of  the  FTS  system,  is  an  antiferromagnetic  (AFM)  Hund  metal  rather  than  a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsuperconductor in its ground state, unlike its superconducting cousin, FeSe.[34, 36] To confirm\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe baseline properties of FeTe, we first grew FeTe film on a mica substrate, which also has a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nhexagonal structure like FGT. Its R vs. T curve in Figure. 4a exhibits the characteristic hump\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfeature near 70 K, indicative of the formation of AFM order, without any hint of SC transition:\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthis  is  consistent  with  the  well-established  transport  properties  of  the  FeTe  system.[36,  41]\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHowever, when we grow FeTe on top of the FGT layer in the same growth condition as the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFeTe film on mica, all of a sudden, superconductivity arises with a clear transition near 12 K,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhile a strong FM state develops below ~220 K (see supplementary Figure S3 for temperature-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe emergence of a superconducting state in otherwise non-superconducting FeTe thin\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfilms  is  surprising.  Yet,  this  is  in  line  with  the  recent  similar  observations  made  in  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nheterostructures  of  (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/FeTe,  FeTe/Bi2Te3,  FeTe/CdTe,  and  FeTe/MnTe.[22-27]\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWhen the superconductivity was first observed in FeTe films after a topological insulator (TI),\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBi2Te3  film  was  deposited  on  top;  it  was  suspected  that  the  topological  surface  state  (TSS)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nshould be the key factor behind the emerging superconducting state in the FeTe layer. However,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsubsequent discoveries of similar superconductivity, even in non-topological systems such as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFeTe/MnTe and FeTe/CdTe, suggest that TSS is not the critical factor behind the SC state in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFeTe. As summarized in Figure. 4b, the only common factor behind all these superconducting\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFeTe films is that they are interfaced with some telluride layers.[28] Nonetheless, it remains a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmystery how neighboring telluride layers can induce superconductivity in the otherwise non-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nWhen  two  telluride  layers  are  neighbored  by  each  other,  even  though  the  anionic\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninterdiffusion can be ignored, cationic interdiffusion can still occur. In the case of the FeTe/FGT\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsystem, both Fe (cation) and Te (anion) interdiffusion can be ignored, but interdiffusion of Ge\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nions cannot. In order to test the impact of Ge diffusion into the FeTe system, we prepared 20\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nnm-thick Ge-doped FeTe films on mica substrates while varying Ge doping levels.

This finding indicates that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nminute levels of Ge diffusion, beyond detection limits of XRD or STEM, can suppress the AFM\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nordering and consequently promote superconductivity in the FeTe films. Then, the emerging\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsuperconductivity  in  the  FeTe/FGT  system  is  very  likely  due  to  a  small  amount  of  Ge  ions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nAccording  to  this  observation,  the  superconducting  FeTe  films  in  other  telluride\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nheterostructures could also be of similar origin. In order to test this possibility, we carried out\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsimilar  doping  tests  on  FeTe  films  using  Bi,  Mn,  Pb,  and  Cr  as  dopants,  which  include  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncations used in the reported superconducting FeTe heterostructures.[22-25, 27] Figure 4d shows\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthat all the Bi-, Mn-, Pb, and Cr-doped FeTe films exhibit similar superconducting transition\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntemperatures without any neighboring telluride layers (see supplementary Figure S4b, for Rxx(T)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbefore normalization). Notably, these five elements - Ge, Bi, Mn, Pb and Cr - do not share any\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncommon properties, yet all of them induce superconductivity in FeTe. Moreover, although the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nquality (sharpness) of the superconducting transition varies depending on the type and amount\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof dopants, the superconducting onset temperatures are all very similar to one another, close to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n~12 K. This suggests that the main role of the dopants is just to disturb the underlying AFM\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\norder of the FeTe system. Once the AFM order is disrupted by cationic impurities, the ground\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstate of the FeTe system seems to switch from AFM to SC state, as sketched in the cartoon of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 4e. This picture is also in line with the long-standing theoretical proposal that FeTe is a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nspecial Hund metal located near an OSMP (orbital selective Mott phase), which is surrounded\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nby  many  competing  phases  such  as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ntopological  superconductivity,  ferromagnetism,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsmall perturbations, such as impurities, should be able to switch the ground state of FeTe from\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\none to another, which seems to readily explain the emergence of SC state in the otherwise AFM\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nground  state  of  FeTe,  as  depicted  in  Figure  4e.  In  other  words,  our  findings  suggest  that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninterfacial cationic diffusion, or “chemical proximity effect,” works as a perturbation to drive\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe unexpected yet  universal superconductivity in various  FeTe-based  heterostructures. This\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nobservation  also  suggests  that  not  only  the  chemical  proximity  effect  but  also  other\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nperturbations such as strain, magnetism, disorder, conducting interfacial states, etc. [22-24, 26, 27,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n37] could also help transition the underlying AFM order of FeTe into the SC or other ground\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstates. This will be an interesting line of future research directions.

Furthermore,  we  found  that  when  non-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsuperconducting FeTe is grown on top of the ferromagnetic FGT layer, the system becomes\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsuperconducting at a temperature comparable to that of the FTS/FGT system. We showed that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nGe-interdiffusion  is  likely  the  main  origin  behind  the  emerging  superconductivity  in  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFeTe/FGT system.

Email: taeggy@physics.rutgers.edu; ohsean@physics.rutgers.edu   Ferromagnetism  (FM)  and  superconductivity  (SC)  are  two  of  the  most  famous   macroscopic quantum phenomena. However, nature normally does not allow SC and FM   to coexist without significant degradation. Here, we introduce the first fully iron-based   SC/FM  heterostructures,  composed  of  Fe(Te,Se)  and  Fe3GeTe2,  and  show  that  in  this   platform strong FM and high-temperature SC robustly coexist. We subsequently discover   that  chemical  proximity  effect  from  neighboring  layers  can  universally  drive  the   otherwise non-superconducting FeTe films into a SC state. This suggests that the ground   state of FeTe is so close to the SC state that it could be driven in and out of the SC state   that  Fe-Te-based   to  manipulate  magnetism,   Despite  the  strong  exclusive  natures  between  superconductivity  and  ferromagnetism,   researchers  have  long  sought  the  possibility  of  coupling  SC  and  FM  states  in  the  hope  of   discovering  new  phenomena  and  functionalities.[1-8]  Particularly  over  the  past  decade,   attention as a platform toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.[9-12] One of the   promising ways to implement such a TSC state is through spin-triplet superconductivity, which   can be stabilized when SC and FM states coexist.[4, 5, 13-15] Among bulk crystals, heavy fermion   superconductors such as UTe2 are believed to exhibit coexisting SC and FM states: thus, UTe2   is considered a strong candidate for a TSC.[1, 6, 8, 16, 17] Sr2RuO4 was once considered a candidate   for a TSC exhibiting both SC and FM state, but recent experiments suggest it is not the case.[18]   Regardless,  all  these  bulk  TSC  candidates  exhibit  relatively  low  TC  (~1  K)  with  rare  or   radioactive elements. An alternative approach is to rely on proximity effects in SC/FM hybrid   structures.  Although  SC/FM  proximity  effects  have  been  a  subject  of  interest  for  many   decades,[3] there are fundamental limitations in the conventional SC/FM heterostructures in that   having an FM layer interfaced with an SC layer inevitably degrades the superconductivity not   only  through  the  electronic  proximity  effect  but  also  through  undesirable  chemical   Recently,  however,  Fe(Te,Se)  (FTS)  superconductors  are  rising  as  a  promising  TSC   platform either on its own or in heterostructures with other telluride layers, such as Bi2Te3/FeTe,   implies  ‘A’  grown  on  top  of  ‘B’.[22-27]  These  FTS-based  heterostructures  provide  several   advantages over conventional proximity platforms in terms of relatively high TC (> ~10 K),   chemical  compatibility, and electronic/magnetic  tunability.   Moreover, one of the surprising   FeTe  system  can  become  superconducting  when  it  is  neighbored  by  other  telluride  layers,   regardless of them being conducting vs. insulating, topological vs. trivial, or antiferromagnetic   vs.  ferromagnetic  vs.  nonmagnetic.[22-28]  The  origin  behind  the  superconducting  FeTe   heterostructures  remains  a  mystery  to  this  day.[28]  Here,  we  present  the  first  ferromagnetic   superconducting platform composed entirely of Fe-based systems and from this, discover that   cationic interdiffusion, or chemical proximity effect, universally leads to superconductivity in   One of the advantages of the FTS-based SC/FM chalcogenide heterostructures is that   both layers share the same (or similar) anions, which allows the effect of anionic interdiffusion   to be negligible. Considering that Fe-based compounds are more commonly in the FM state   rather than in the SC state, it is not difficult to find Fe-based FM materials. In particular, we   note that recently discovered 2D FM materials, Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) is one of the best Fe-based FM   materials  that  can  be  mated  with  the  superconducting  FTS  layer.  FGT  is  a  van  der  Waals   material  and  exhibits  strong  perpendicular  magnetic  anisotropy  (Ising  type)  with  a  Curie   temperature near 220 K. There are also reports of Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY)   type FM in  FGT, which  may impact  the magnetic ordering of adjacent  layers.  Accordingly,   FGT has been one of the popular 2D FM materials used for spintronics research. [29-31] It is also   notable  that  both  FGT  and  FTS  are  known  to  be  Hund  metals,  which  exhibit  correlated   electronic properties governed by orbital-selective Hund coupling rather than on-site Coulomb   to study how different Hund metals interact with each other and affect the nature of proximity   coupling  between  SC  and  FM  states.  Nonetheless,  considering  that  the  6-fold  in-plane   symmetry of FGT does not match the 4-fold symmetry of the FTS system, it is still questionable   We grew a series of FTS/FGT films on 10×10×0.5 mm3 Al2O3 (0001) substrates using a custom-   built MBE system with a base pressure of ~10−10 Torr. Before growth, each Al2O3 substrate   was cleaned ex situ with UV-generated ozone and in situ by heating to 750 °C under oxygen   pressure  of  5  ×  10−7  Torr.  High-purity  elemental  sources  of  Fe,  Ge,  Bi,  Se,  and  Te  were   thermally evaporated using standard effusion cells. The source fluxes were calibrated in situ by   quartz crystal micro-balance and ex-situ by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. Figure 1a   shows  the  schematic  SC/FM  heterostructure  with  a  sharp  streaky  RHEED  pattern  recorded   during the growth of each material. 6-fold in-plane symmetry of the FGT layer can be confirmed   in the RHEED patterns which exhibit a periodicity of 60 degrees, with an alternating spacing   ratio of √3a and a in two high-symmetry directions. On the other hand, the RHEED pattern of   the 4-fold symmetry of the FTS layer on top of FGT shows an alternating spacing ratio of √2a   and a in two high-symmetry directions, with 30 degrees of periodicity. This is consistent with   the 12-fold symmetry of FTS films grown on 6-fold symmetric underlying layers of Bi2Te3 (BT)   and MnTe (MT), as observed previously. [23, 24] As shown in Figure 1b, all XRD peaks can be   identified with the c-axis (00n) peaks of FTS (squares), FGT (circles), and substrate Al2O3. The   high-angle  annular  dark-field  scanning  transmission  electron  microscopy  (HAADF-STEM)   image  in  Figure  2a  shows  an  atomically  sharp  interface  between  FTS  and  FGT  with  the  c-   High-quality FTS growth on FGT underlayer is unexpected and surprising. Although   we previously observed similarly high-quality epitaxial growth between 4-fold FTS and 6-fold   BT as well as 6-fold MT through the hybrid symmetry epitaxy mode, they still required uniaxial   lattice matching: their in-plane lattice constants are related by 2:3 ratio. On the other hand, in   the case of FTS vs. FGT with in-plane lattice constants of 3.80 Å (FTS) and 3.99 Å (FGT), they   are ~5% off with their original lattice constants and ~10% off when 2:3 ratio is considered.   The discovery that 4-fold FTS can grow on 6-fold FGT even without uniaxial lattice matching   implies  that  the  hybrid  symmetry  epitaxy  mode  is  much  more  common  than  we  previously   anticipated. This could be related to the underlying FGT layer being a van der Waals material   Now that we have identified the structural integrity of the FTS/FGT system, we  will   discuss their transport properties. In Figure 2b, we present temperature-dependent longitudinal   (black)  and  Hall  (red)  resistances  in  the  absence  of  external  magnetic  fields.  Near  room   temperature, Rxy is negligible but as temperature drops below ~220 K, Rxy steeply increases and   maintains a large value until it plummets to zero, as Rxx also goes to zero, at ~13 K. This implies   that the FTS/FGT system goes into an FM state below ~220 K, the Curie temperature of the   FGT layer, and then fall into the SC state at ~13 K, the superconducting transition temperature   of the FTS layer.[31, 33, 36, 37] In Figure 2b, we define and indicate three different superconducting   critical temperatures: Tonset of 13.5 K,  T0 of 9.5 K, and Tc of 12.5 K (when resistance drops to   50% of the normal state resistance), which are very similar to those reported previously for non-   magnetic,  FTS/Bi2Te3  heterostructures  with  similar  Te/Se  composition  of  the  FTS  layer.[23]   Figure 2c presents Hall resistance vs external magnetic field at various temperatures. It also   shows that the coercivity field, Bc, keeps increasing as temperature drops below ~220 K until   the SC state kicks in below ~13 K. Analysis of the transport properties near Tc (supplementary   Figure  S1)  shows  that  the  system  can  be  well  described  by  the  2D  Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-   Below Tc, even though transport signals all disappear to zero due to superconductivity,   we  can  still  probe  the  ferromagnetic  state  of  the  FTS/FGT  system  using  magnetic  force   microscopy (MFM), as shown in Figure 3a (see supplementary Figure S2, for the complete set   of MFM images). The uniform magnetic contrast shown in Figures 3a(I) and (II) represents a   downward magnetization state. After the sample is saturated with -1 T of magnetic field (3a(I)),   the sample remains in the downward magnetization state up to 0.2 T (3a(II)). As the field further   increases, the sample is gradually aligned with the direction of the external field (Figure 3A   (III-VI)). Eventually, this leads to the formation of an upward magnetization domain (Figure   3a(VII)).  Figure 3a(VIII) shows that this saturated upward magnetization state persists while   the magnetic field is reduced to zero. The field dependence of the magnetization signal (black   circles in Figure 3b  bottom  panel) obtained from the MFM data is  fully  consistent with  the   anomalous  Hall  data  in  Fig.  3b  (top  panel),  measured  above  the  superconducting  transition   temperature. The persistence of the saturated state in a zero magnetic field with a large coercive   field (0.25 T) indicates a strong FM state with uniaxial (perpendicular) magnetic anisotropy of   FGT, coexisting with the superconducting state of FTS. The variation in domain population,   frms, is estimated by calculating the root-mean-square (RMS) values of MFM signal in each   image (red triangles in Fig. 3b bottom panel). The maximal RMS value indicates the largest   variation  of  the  magnetic  stray  field  due  to  the  multi-domain  state,  and  the  corresponding   magnetic field is fully consistent with the coercive field Hc, measured with transport in Figure   that  there  is,  if  at  all,  very  little  degradation  of  each  of  their  original  properties,  unlike   conventional  SC/FM  heterostructures,  where  superconducting  Tc  always  degrades  due  to   implies that the effect of disorder is minimal in this system and that SC properties of the FTS   layer are robust against coupling with the FM order. On the other hand, however, it raises the   question of whether there is any proximity coupling between FTS and FGT. To address this   question, we synthesized a simpler, Se-free, FeTe/FGT heterostructure, which is supposed to   be  non-superconducting.    It  has  long  been  the  general  consensus  that  FeTe,  the  Te-rich   endmember  of  the  FTS  system,  is  an  antiferromagnetic  (AFM)  Hund  metal  rather  than  a   superconductor in its ground state, unlike its superconducting cousin, FeSe.[34, 36] To confirm   the baseline properties of FeTe, we first grew FeTe film on a mica substrate, which also has a   hexagonal structure like FGT. Its R vs. T curve in Figure. 4a exhibits the characteristic hump   feature near 70 K, indicative of the formation of AFM order, without any hint of SC transition:   this  is  consistent  with  the  well-established  transport  properties  of  the  FeTe  system.[36,  41]   However, when we grow FeTe on top of the FGT layer in the same growth condition as the   FeTe film on mica, all of a sudden, superconductivity arises with a clear transition near 12 K,   while a strong FM state develops below ~220 K (see supplementary Figure S3 for temperature-   The emergence of a superconducting state in otherwise non-superconducting FeTe thin   films  is  surprising.  Yet,  this  is  in  line  with  the  recent  similar  observations  made  in  the   heterostructures  of  (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/FeTe,  FeTe/Bi2Te3,  FeTe/CdTe,  and  FeTe/MnTe.[22-27]   When the superconductivity was first observed in FeTe films after a topological insulator (TI),   Bi2Te3  film  was  deposited  on  top;  it  was  suspected  that  the  topological  surface  state  (TSS)   should be the key factor behind the emerging superconducting state in the FeTe layer. However,   subsequent discoveries of similar superconductivity, even in non-topological systems such as   FeTe/MnTe and FeTe/CdTe, suggest that TSS is not the critical factor behind the SC state in   FeTe. As summarized in Figure. 4b, the only common factor behind all these superconducting   FeTe films is that they are interfaced with some telluride layers.[28] Nonetheless, it remains a   mystery how neighboring telluride layers can induce superconductivity in the otherwise non-   When  two  telluride  layers  are  neighbored  by  each  other,  even  though  the  anionic   interdiffusion can be ignored, cationic interdiffusion can still occur. In the case of the FeTe/FGT   system, both Fe (cation) and Te (anion) interdiffusion can be ignored, but interdiffusion of Ge   ions cannot. In order to test the impact of Ge diffusion into the FeTe system, we prepared 20   nm-thick Ge-doped FeTe films on mica substrates while varying Ge doping levels. Surprisingly,   when  FeTe  films  are  doped  with  a  small  amount  (0.5  %  and  0.75  %)  of  Ge,  clear   superconducting transitions showed up near 11 K, whereas 5 % Ge-doped FeTe film displayed   insulating behavior without any hint of superconducting transitions, as shown in Figure 4c (see   supplementary Figure S4a, for the Rxx(T) data before normalization). This finding indicates that   minute levels of Ge diffusion, beyond detection limits of XRD or STEM, can suppress the AFM   ordering and consequently promote superconductivity in the FeTe films. Then, the emerging   superconductivity  in  the  FeTe/FGT  system  is  very  likely  due  to  a  small  amount  of  Ge  ions   According  to  this  observation,  the  superconducting  FeTe  films  in  other  telluride   heterostructures could also be of similar origin. In order to test this possibility, we carried out   similar  doping  tests  on  FeTe  films  using  Bi,  Mn,  Pb,  and  Cr  as  dopants,  which  include  the   cations used in the reported superconducting FeTe heterostructures.[22-25, 27] Figure 4d shows   that all the Bi-, Mn-, Pb, and Cr-doped FeTe films exhibit similar superconducting transition   temperatures without any neighboring telluride layers (see supplementary Figure S4b, for Rxx(T)   before normalization). Notably, these five elements - Ge, Bi, Mn, Pb and Cr - do not share any   common properties, yet all of them induce superconductivity in FeTe. Moreover, although the   quality (sharpness) of the superconducting transition varies depending on the type and amount   of dopants, the superconducting onset temperatures are all very similar to one another, close to   ~12 K. This suggests that the main role of the dopants is just to disturb the underlying AFM   order of the FeTe system. Once the AFM order is disrupted by cationic impurities, the ground   state of the FeTe system seems to switch from AFM to SC state, as sketched in the cartoon of   Figure 4e. This picture is also in line with the long-standing theoretical proposal that FeTe is a   special Hund metal located near an OSMP (orbital selective Mott phase), which is surrounded   by  many  competing  phases  such  as   topological  superconductivity,  ferromagnetism,   small perturbations, such as impurities, should be able to switch the ground state of FeTe from   one to another, which seems to readily explain the emergence of SC state in the otherwise AFM   ground  state  of  FeTe,  as  depicted  in  Figure  4e.  In  other  words,  our  findings  suggest  that   interfacial cationic diffusion, or “chemical proximity effect,” works as a perturbation to drive   the unexpected yet  universal superconductivity in various  FeTe-based  heterostructures. This   observation  also  suggests  that  not  only  the  chemical  proximity  effect  but  also  other   perturbations such as strain, magnetism, disorder, conducting interfacial states, etc. [22-24, 26, 27,   37] could also help transition the underlying AFM order of FeTe into the SC or other ground   states. This will be an interesting line of future research directions. The bottom line is that FeTe   heterostructures  exhibit  a  unique  bi-directional  SC  proximity  effect   that  once   superconductivity is induced in the FeTe layer by its neighbor through the chemical (or other   perturbative) proximity effect, the superconducting FeTe layer can proximitize the neighboring   introduced   heterostructure, FTS/FGT, both of which are known to be correlated Hund metals. [32-35] The   system becomes ferromagnetic below ~220 K and superconducting below ~13 K. MFM study   shows  that  the  FM  state  coexists  with  the  SC  state.  Furthermore,  we  found  that  when  non-   superconducting FeTe is grown on top of the ferromagnetic FGT layer, the system becomes   superconducting at a temperature comparable to that of the FTS/FGT system. We showed that   Ge-interdiffusion  is  likely  the  main  origin  behind  the  emerging  superconductivity  in  the   FeTe/FGT system.  Moreover, it is shown that superconductivity can be universally induced in   the FeTe system with a wide range of other cationic impurities, including Bi, Mn, Pb, and Cr.   Considering that such a minute level of interdiffusion is unavoidable in FeTe-based telluride   heterostructures, superconductivity can universally emerge in FeTe heterostructures even if the   component layers are not superconducting on their own. This also suggests that the ground state   of FeTe is very close to the SC state such that it might be possible to drive it in and out of the   SC state with a variety of other perturbations. Altogether, this study shows that Fe-Te-based   heterostructures  provide  a  unique  opportunity  to  study  a  variety  of  novel  physics  and   applications  such  as  Hund  metals,  ferromagnetic  superconductors,  cryogenic  spintronics,   topological  quantum  computation,  and  Majorana  physics,  paving  the  way  toward  new   Thin-film  growth: We prepared  FTS/FGT and  FT/FGT films on  10×10×0.5 mm3 Al2O3   (0001) and FT film on flexible mica (Ted Pella) substrates using a custom-built MBE system   (SVTA) with a  base pressure of  ~10−10  Torr. Al2O3 substrates were cleaned ex-situ by UV-   generated ozone and in situ by heating to 750 °C under oxygen pressure of 5 × 10−7 Torr. For   the  mica  substrate,  we  exfoliate  the  contaminated  surface  right  before  loading  it  into  the   chamber and in situ cleaning at 400 °C for 15 min. High purities of Fe, Ge, Bi, Se, Mn, Pb, and   Te were thermally evaporated using Knudsen diffusion cells for the film growth. All the source   fluxes  were  calibrated  in-situ  by  quartz  crystal  micro-balance  and  ex-situ  by  Rutherford   backscattering spectroscopy.  All capping layers were deposited at room temperature on top of   Transport measurements: All transport measurements were performed using the standard   Hall bar patterned samples with the channel length and width of 3 mm and 1 mm, respectively.   Five indium wires were manually pressed on the Hall bar patterned sample used for four-probe   longitudinal and Hall resistance measurements. Keithley 2400 source-measure units and 7001   switch  matrix  system  were  controlled  by  a  LabView  program  for  the  longitudinal  and  Hall   resistances  measurements.  Quantum  anomalous  Hall  effect  measurements  were  done  in  a   Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design inc.) down to 2 K.

HAADF  STEM   images were acquired with 200 keV electrons with collection angles ranging from 67 to 275   Magnetic force microscopy (MFM): MFM images of Fe(Te,Se)/Fe3GeTe2 were taken by   using  a  homemade  Helium-3  MFM  system  equipped  with  in  situ  transport  measurement   capability.

MFM imaging was conducted in constant-height noncontact   mode.  The  MFM  signal  (the  resonant  frequency  shift)  is  proportional  to  the  out-of-plane   magnetic force gradient, which was extracted by a phase-locked loop (SPECS).

Kisslinger,  Kai  Du,  Myung-Geun  Han,  Yimei  Zhu,  Weida  Wu,  Sang-Wook  Cheong,  and   We analyze the superconducting transport properties of the FTS/FGT system. Figure S1a and S2b show the temperature-dependent normalized longitudinal resistance Rxx/Rn(T,B) under external magnetic fields along perpendicular and parallel directions to the film surface. As  we  increased  the  magnetic  fields  from  0  to  9  T  along  B//c,  we  observed  a  significant broadening of Tc. On the other hand, in the B//ab direction, the reduction in Tc was relatively minimal. Current (I) vs voltage (V) characteristics near Tc in Figure S1c and d show that the superconducting behavior is well described by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition (BKT) of vortex-antivortex pairs in 2d. 1-3 We show in Figure S1c, a temperature-dependent, log-log I-V plot, with V  I (black dashed line) and V  I3 (red dashed line) to compare with the power-law equation of V  Ia(T). The detailed temperature dependence of the exponent () in Figure  S1d  provides  superconducting  onset  temperature  of  13.5  K  with    =  1,  and  BKT temperature of 12.2 K with  = 3, both of which are well matched with the Tonset of 13.5 K and the Tc of 12.5 K observed in the R-T data of Figure 2b. A close match of TBKT and Tc indicates that this system follows the BKT transition.",

         "The catalytic activity of carbon dots (CDs) has generated significant interest regarding their potential applications within the biomedical field. However, the structure‐activity relationship of CDs and their pharmacological mechanisms in disease treatment have yet to be comprehensively elucidated. In this study, two distinct types of CDs exhibiting superoxide dismutase (SOD)‐like enzymatic activities are synthesized through hydrothermal (Hy‐CDs) and carbonization (Ca‐CDs) methods, utilizing Honeysuckle as the common carbon material precursor. Through comparative analysis, surface group modifications, and theoretical calculations, it is determined that the SOD‐like enzymatic activity of CDs primarily originated from the stabilizing influence of the amino group on the superoxide (•O2−) intermediate and its conjugation to the π‐system, facilitating electron transfer. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Hy‐CDs effectively alleviated cellular oxidative stress and inhibited the secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the significant bioactivity and catalytic properties of Hy‐CDs contribute to their pronounced therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) and lung ischemia/reperfusion injury (LIRI). Guided by transcriptomic analysis and Western blotting, it is demonstrated that Hy‐CDs effectively inhibit Caspase11/GSDMD‐dependent non‐classical pyroptosis by down‐regulating GBP2 protein expression, thereby contributing to lung inflammation. This study elucidates the structure‐activity relationship and underlying biological mechanisms of Hy‐CDs in therapeutic applications.",

         " Nernst Effect-based thermoelectrics   Olajumoke Oluwatobiloba Emmanuel, Shuvankar Gupta* and Xianglin Ke*   Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan   Keywords:  (Kagome  magnets,  Nerst  effects,  Topological  Hall,  Topological  Nernst,   Abstract  text.  The  Nernst  effect,  the  generation  of  a  traverse  electric  voltage  in  the   presence  of  longitudinal  thermal  gradient,  has  garnered  significant  attention  in  the  realm  of   magnetic topological materials due to its superior potential for thermoelectric applications. In   this  work,  we  investigate  electronic  and  thermoelectric  transport  properties  of  a  Kagome   by a ferrimagnetic phase transition upon cooling. We show that in the antiferromagnetic phase   ErMn6Sn6 exhibits both topological Nernst effect and anomalous Nernst effect, analogous to   the electric Hall effects, with the Nernst coefficient reaching 1.71 µV K⁻¹ at 300 K and 3 T.   that  of  most  of  previously  reported  state-of-the-art  canted   antiferromagnetic materials and is comparable to recently reported other members of RMn6Sn6   (R  =  rare-earth,  Y,  Lu,  Sc)  compounds,  which  makes  ErMn6Sn6  a  promising  candidate  for   Magnets with a Kagome lattice present a rich platform for the investigation of various   extraordinary electronic and magnetic phenomena arising from the Kagome lattice geometry.   [1–4]  In particular, recently metallic RMn6Sn6 (R = rare-earth, Y, Lu, Sc) magnets, in which   manganese atoms form a Kagome lattice, have been characterized with distinctive electronic   features  such  as  Dirac  points,  van  Hove  singularities,  flat  bands  and  the  resulting  physical   properties. [5–8] For instance, TbMn6Sn6 exhibits a fascinating combination of a Chern gap  [9]   and magneto-thermal properties [10,11], along with a skyrmion spin lattice [12], providing valuable   insights into topological electronic properties and spin textures. And YMn6Sn6 exhibits a room-   temperature topological Hall effect, showcasing its potential for spintronic applications. [13,14]   More broadly, the RMn6Sn6 series were reported to show topological transport properties that   are attributable to nontrivial Berry phase arising from the Kagome lattice, highlighting the roles   of lattice geometry on the topological electronic properties of these compounds. [15]   In recent  years, there has been growing  interest  in  studying  anomalous Nernst effect   (ANE)  in  magnetic  topological  materials,  partially  driven  by  its  distinct  advantages  over   conventional  Seebeck-based  devices  in  thermoelectric  applications.  [10,16–21]  The  ANE,   analogous to the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), manifests as a transverse thermoelectric voltage   perpendicular to both the temperature gradient and the applied magnetic field, all of which are   mutually orthogonal. Unlike the AHE which is determined by the Berry curvature of electronic   bands  over  the  whole  Fermi-sea,  the  ANE  is  particularly  sensitive  to  Berry  curvature  of   electronic bands near the Fermi level, making it a potent indicator of thermoelectric efficiency   in materials with significant Berry curvature, such as certain ferromagnetic (FM) compounds.   [20–22] However, the presence of stray magnetic fields in FM materials poses stability challenges   for  ANE-based  devices,  prompting  exploration  into  antiferromagnetic  (AFM)  materials  like   MnGe,  [23]  Mn3Sn,  [24]  Mn3Ge,  [25]  and  YbMnBi2,  [26]  which  exhibit  noncollinear  magnetic   structures  and  lower  susceptibility  to  stray  fields.  Despite  initial  successes,  most  of  AFM   materials  investigated  have  shown  relatively  low  ANE  values,  with  notable  exceptions  like   YbMnBi2  which  displays  a  high  ANE  albeit  restricted  to  low  temperatures.  [26]  To  advance   practical applications, identifying AFM materials with high ANE at room temperature is crucial.   Recent studies have reported a large ANE in AFM compounds YMn6Sn6 [27] and ScMn6Sn6 [28]   as well  as in  a ferrimagnetic (FIM) compound  TbMn6Sn6   , opening  new  directions  for   exploring ANE-based compounds within the RMn6Sn6 family. Notably, ErMn6Sn6 presents a   unique case due to its competing Er-Mn and Mn-Mn couplings along the c-axis, [29] which give   rise to FIM and incommensurate AFM phases in different temperature regimes. [30] Note that   ErMn6Sn6 is on the border between (Y, Sc, Lu)Mn6Sn6 which have an incommensurate AFM   ground state and (Ho, Dy, Tb, Td)Mn6Sn6 which are ferrimagnets, possessing a ferrimagnetic   ground state preceded by an AFM phase with incommensurate spin structure of both Mn and   In  this  study,  we  perform  a  comprehensive  study  of  electronic  and  thermoelectric   transport  properties  of  ErMn6Sn6.  Our  findings  reveal  that  ErMn6Sn6  exhibits  both  the   topological  and  anomalous  Nernst  effects,  similar  to  the  electric  Hall  effects,  with  a  Nernst   coefficient of 1.71 µV K⁻¹ at 300 K which is on par with other recently reported RMn6Sn6 (R =   rare-earth, Y, Lu, Sc) compounds. These results position ErMn6Sn6 as a strong candidate for   the  development  of  advanced  Nernst  effect-based  thermoelectric  devices,  highlighting  the   significance of exploring magnetic topological materials with interplay among lattice geometry,   Figure 1 (a) Top left panel shows the crystal structure of ErMn6Sn6; top right panel shows the   Mn Kagome lattice.

Tin (Sn) atoms reside at three distinct Wyckoff sites:   Sn1 (1/3, 2/3, 0), Sn2 (1/3, 2/3, 1/2), and Sn3 (0, 0, ~0.8364). [32] Within each unit cell, there are   two layers of Mn atoms at z positions of ~ 0.25*c and ~ 0.75*c, each of which forms a Kagome   web as illustrated in the top right panel. As mentioned previously, due to the interplay among   Er-Mn,  Er-Er,  and  Mn-Mn  exchange  interactions,  ErMn6Sn6  exhibits  complex  magnetic   properties. [33] It undergoes an antiferromagnetic phase transition at TN = 348 K below which   both Mn and Er spins form incommensurate structures along the c-axis while ferromagnetically   aligned within the ab plane. This is followed by a ferrimagnetic phase transition upon cooling   to  ~ 68 K, where all Mn  spins and Er spins remain ferromagnetically aligned within the  ab   plane  while  Mn  and  Er  spins  are  antiparallel  aligned.  [29,30,32]  In  addition,  the  presence  of   massive Dirac bands resulting from the Kagome lattice of Mn atoms is found to be close to the   Fermi  energy,  which  is  anticipated  to  lead  to  emergent  electronic  transport  phenomena  in   [29] Figure 1(b) presents the temperature-dependent magnetization (M) of ErMn₆Sn₆   measured with an in-plane magnetic field (H || ab) of 0.1 kOe from 2 K to 390 K under zero-   field-cooled  (ZFC)  and  field-cooled  (FCC)  conditions.  As  shown  in  the  inset,  an  anomaly   observed at TN ≈ 348 K signifies an antiferromagnetic transition, which is followed by another   phase transition at Tc = 68 K with a sharp increase in magnetic moment that corresponds to the   Figure  1(c)  depicts  isothermal  magnetization  M(H)  curves  measured  at  various   temperatures. Above Tc, a field-induced metamagnetic transition is observed below 2 T, which   is  accompanied  by  a  large  enhancement  in  magnetization  and  a  hysteresis  loop.  Above  the   transition field, the magnetic moment reaches a plateau value of ~ 5-6 µB/f.u. only, suggesting   a field-induced phase transition from an AFM to a FIM state. [33] This implies a strong Er-Mn   antiferromagnetic coupling compared to the Mn-Mn coupling between adjacent planes along   the c-axis. Interestingly, the transition field shows non-monotonic dependence of temperature,   as shown in  the inset  of  Figure  1(c),  which is  consistent with  an earlier report.  [34]  Such a   metamagnetic  phase  transition  disappears  below  Tc.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  saturated   magnetization  decreases  upon  decreasing  the  measurement  temperature.  This  is  due  to  the   continuously enhanced Er magnetic moment at lower temperature which tends to antiparallel   align to the Mn moment due to the Er-Mn antiferromagnetic coupling. [34]   Figure  1(d)  shows  the  temperature  dependence  of  electrical  resistivity  (ρyy  and  ρzz)   measured  at  zero  magnetic  field  with  the  current  applied  along  both  y  (I  ||  y)  and  z  (I  ||  z)   directions. For both current directions, the resistivity increases monotonically with temperature.   The residual resistivity ratio (RRR), defined as R300K/R2K, is found to be 144.66 for (I || y) and   68.37 for (I || z), affirming high quality of ErMn6Sn6 crystals. There are a couple of features   worth pointing out. First, as shown in the inset which displays the temperature derivative of   resistivity (dρ/dT), a distinct change in the slope of ρ(T) is observed at Tc, which coincides with   the ferrimagnetic transition and implies the magnetoelectric coupling. Second, ρyy and ρzz are   comparable  in  magnitude,  suggesting  three-dimensional  nature  of  the  electronic  transport   Figure 2. Magnetic field dependence of magnetoresistance (MR) (a) and magneto-Seebeck (b)   effects measured at various temperatures.  (c) Temperature dependence of Seebeck measured   at  0 T and 3 T.    (d) Temperature dependence of MR and  Seebeck  measured at  3 T.  For  all   magnetic measurements, the magnetic field was applied along the in-plane direction (x-axis).   We  next  present  the  magnetic  field  dependence  of  longitudinal  electric  and   thermoelectric responses of ErMn6Sn6. Figure 2(a) shows the field dependence of longitudinal   magnetoresistance (MR) which is defined as MR = (ρ(H) – ρ(0))/ρ(0), where ρ(H) and ρ(0) are   the resistivity measured with and without magnetic field, respectively. Both the magnetic field   and electric current were applied along the y-axis. At Tc < T < TN, negative MR with respect to   the field is observed with the magnitude of MR increasing sharply upon the spin-flop transition   as  observed  in  isothermal  M(H)  measurements  shown  in  Figure  1(c).  Such  a  feature  is   ascribable  to  the  decrease  of  spin  scattering  due  to  the  field-induced  transition  from  an   incommensurate  AFM  phase  to  FIM  phase.  In  contrast,  a  large  positive  MR  but  not  field-   induced phase transition is observed below Tc, as shown in Figure S1, [35] which may be related   to the dominant orbital scattering. [36] Note that similar MR behaviours above and below Tc has   been observed in Er₀.₅Ho₀.₅Mn₆Sn₆. [37] Figure 2(b) presents the magnetic field dependence of   Seebeck coefficient (Syy) measured at various temperatures. In the temperature range 200 K <   T < TN, the behaviour of Syy resembles that of MR with negative magneto-Seebeck effect. That   is, the magnitude of Syy decreases at high field and it is smaller than the value at zero field.   However, a key distinction emerges in the Tc < T < 200 K region where Syy exhibits an upturn   and positive magneto-Seebeck feature that is absent in the MR data.   It is known that the thermoelectric response in metallic systems can be approximated   using  the  Mott  relation  [38]:  𝑆 =   −   |𝐸𝐹 ,  where  kB  Boltzmann  constant,  σ  is  the   conductivity, e is electron charge, ζ represents the energy variable and EF is the Fermi energy.   |𝐸𝐹 remains  nearly  field-independent,  S  is  then  proportional  to  the  resistivity  ρ  (=1/𝜎),   resulting in similar magnetic field dependences for the MR and the magneto-Seebeck effect.   This behaviour is indeed observed in ErMn₆Sn₆ above 200 K, as shown in the left panels of   Figure  2(a)  and  (b).  However,  below  200  K,  the  MR  and  magneto-Seebeck  effect  begin  to   exhibit  an  opposite  trend,  as  seen  in  the  right  panels  of  Figure  2(a)  and  (b).  A  plausible   |𝐸𝐹 becomes field-dependent and adopts an opposite trend for the MR and   magneto-Seebeck  effect.  This  may  arise  from  alterations  in  the  electronic  structure  as   ferromagnetic correlations between Mn spins become enhanced upon further cooling. Such a   scenario  aligns  with  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  critical  field  for  the  spin-flop  phase   transition, which peaks around 200 K (inset of Figure 1(c)). To fully elucidate the underlying   mechanisms driving the observed magneto-Seebeck effect below 200 K (Figure 2(b)), further   investigations,  including  detailed  calculations  or  measurements  of  the  electronic  structure   across different temperature regimes, are highly desirable. Similar magnetic field dependence   of longitudinal electric and thermoelectric responses of ErMn6Sn6 was also measured along z   direction, as shown in Figure S2. [35] Figure 2(d) summarizes the temperature dependence of   Figure 3.  Magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity measured at different temperatures. (b)   Magnetic field dependence of different Hall resistivity components at 250 K. (c) Temperature   zy) (d) The magnetic field dependence of Hall conductivity measured at various temperatures.   For all magnetic measurements, the magnetic field was applied along the in-plane direction (x-   Now  we  move  on  to  discuss  the  transverse  electric  and  thermoelectric  response  in   ErMn6Sn6.  In Figure 3(a) we present the transverse resistivity response (ρzy) as a function of   the magnetic field applied along the x-axis, with the current applied along the y-axis and the   transverse voltage measured along the z-axis. The overall behaviour of ρzy(H) is similar to the   M(H) data depicted in Figure1(c). In magnetic topological materials, the total Hall resistivity   (ρH) is expressed as ρH = ρN + ρA + ρT, where ρN, ρA, and ρT represent the normal, anomalous,   and topological Hall contributions, respectively. The normal Hall contribution ρN(H) is defined   as ρN(H)=R0H, where R0 is the coefficient of normal Hall resistivity. The sign of R0 is crucial   for determining the majority charge carrier. [39] The anomalous Hall resistivity, ρA, is defined   as ρA = RS4πM, which can have extrinsic contributions from skew scattering and/or side-jump   scattering and/or intrinsic contribution from the Berry curvature of electronic band structure.   [39] The topological Hall resistivity ρT arises from non-zero spin chirality. [40,41]   In the high-field saturation region where the ρT term diminishes, ρH simplifies to ρH =   R0H + RS4πM. From the linear plot of ρH/M versus H/M in this region, we can estimate the   slope R0 and the intercept 4πRS. As an example, following this method we extracted the Hall   contributions of ρN, ρA, and ρT at 250 K, as shown in Figure 3(b). Similar features of Hall effect   in  ErMn6Sn6  have  been  reported  in.  [29]  As  shown  in  Figure  S3  [35]  and  discussed  in  the   Supplemental Information [35], we find that the extracted ρA component in ErMn6Sn6 is mainly   attributed to the Berry curvature of its electronic structure. Figure 3(c) showing the temperature   𝑚𝑎𝑥) extracted at various temperatures. [41] One can see that   𝑚𝑎𝑥 reaches a maximum at 300 K with a value of 1.2 µΩ cm at 300 K, comparable to the   values found in YMn6Sn6 [13,14] and larger than those reported for materials such as Mn5Si3 [42]   The topological Hall effect is generally believed to occur due to the static scalar spin   chirality (SSC) associated with non-coplanar magnetic structures. [44–46] Such a mechanism was   recently proposed to account for the observed topological Hall effect in isostructural YMn₆Sn₆   owing to the modification of spiral spin structure in the presence of magnetic field that breaks   the spin coplanarity. [13]  On the other hand, a fluctuation-driven mechanism was proposed [14],   where  an  internal  dynamic  Skyrmion-like  chiral  field  is  generated  through  the  chiral   fluctuations with a field-induced preferential handedness. This consequently leads to non-zero   spin chirality, giving rise to a topological Hall effect. In YMn6Sn6 compounds, the topological   Hall effect is observed at finite temperatures and within a magnetic phase characterized by a   transverse  conical  spiral  (TCS)  propagating  along  the  c-axis.  Figure  3(c)  shows  that  the   topological Hall effect in ErMn6Sn6 persists in the 100 – 300 K temperature range and a narrow   field range between 1 – 1.5 T, a region in which the TCS phase is formed as revealed by recent   neutron  diffraction  studies.  [47]  While  it  is  challenging  to  determine  which  mechanism   dominates, it is worth mentioning that the field-induced TCS phase is pivotal for the observation   Figure 3(d) shows the field dependence of the calculated Hall conductivity for different   temperatures. The Hall conductivity value is comparable to that of TbMn6Sn6. [10] It is worth   noting that similar features and magnitude of electric Hall signal has been measured with the   current  applied  along  z-axis  and  Hall  signal  measured  along  the  y-axis,  i.e,  ρyz,  which  is   presented in Figure S4, [35] suggesting that the Onsager reciprocal relation is obeyed.

(c) Temperature dependence of anomalous Nernst coefficient extracted at 3 T. (d) Temperature   dependence of the calculated thermoelectric conductivity at 3T as described in the main text.   For all magnetic measurements, the magnetic field was applied along the in-plane direction (x-   Figure  4(a)  presents  the  transverse  thermoelectric  response  of  ErMn6Sn6  at  various   temperatures. The data is plotted as a function of magnetic field applied along the x-axis, with   the heat applied along the y-axis and the transverse voltage measured along the z-axis (refer to   Figure S5 [35] for data measured with the heat applied along the z-axis). The field dependent   Nernst coefficient (Szy) in ErMn6Sn6, similar to the Hall data presented in Figure 3(a), mimics   the  M(H)  data  shown  in  Figure  1(c).  This  similarity  underscores  the  shared  underlying   mechanisms of the transverse transport properties observed in both Hall and Nernst effects. As   to be discussed, the origin of these transverse transport properties stems from the combination   of both non-trivial band topology and finite spin chirality of the material.  Similar to the electric   Hall effect, the Nernst signal (Szy) contains three components Szy = S0   zy, where   zy represents the normal component, SA   zy is the anomalous contribution, and ST   zy  denotes the   topological contribution. Using the methodology discussed above, we can extract these three   Nernst components as illustrated in Figure 4(b) for the data measured at 250 K and temperature   zy is presented in Figure 3 (c). The temperature dependence of SA   zy is shown   zy increases with temperature, reaching a maximum value of 1.71 µV K⁻¹   at 300 K. This value is comparable to other members of the same series, such as 2.2 µV K⁻¹ for   [10] 2 µV K⁻¹ for YMn6Sn6, [27] and 2.21 µV K⁻¹ for ScMn6Sn6 [28] and it surpasses   that  of  previously  reported  state-of-the-art  canted  AFM  materials,  including  Mn3Sn  [24]  and   As  discussed  previously,  in  this  system  the  massive  Dirac  bands  associated  with  the   Kagome lattice of Mn atoms give rise to non-zero Berry curvature. As a result, charge carriers   acquire an ‘anomalous velocity’ leading to the observed anomalous transverse conductivities.   Although both the AHE and the ANE stem from the non-trivial band topology, the ANE is more   sensitive than the AHE to the Berry curvature near the Fermi level, making it a more sensitive   probe of the electronic structure near Fermi level. On the other hand, both the topological Nernst   effect  and  the  topological  Hall  effect  observed  in  ErMn6Sn6  arise  from  finite  spin  chirality,   which  produces  superimposed  geometrical  effects  above  the  normal  Hall  and  Nernst   components.  Similar  effects  have  been  observed  in  ScMn6Sn6,  [28]  although  the  topological   Nernst effect is surprisingly absent in YMn6Sn6  [27]. This discrepancy could be due to subtle   differences in the spin structure within the spiral ordering, necessitating careful analysis.   To  further  understand  the  thermoelectric  properties,  we  estimated  the  Nernst   thermoelectric conductivity (αij) based on the measured resistivities (ρii, ρij) and thermopowers   [48]. The values of αij for both yz and zy measurement   configurations were found to increase with decreasing temperature from 300 K, as shown in   Figure  4(d),  with  a  maximum  observed  at  200  K.  This  behaviour  is  consistent  with  the   observations  for  YMn6Sn6  [27],  while  an  opposite  trend  is  noted  for  ScMn6Sn6  [28].  It  is  also   noteworthy that |αyz| = |αzy|, confirming that the Onsager reciprocal relation [48–50] holds well for   ErMn6Sn6. The αyz value peaks at 1.79 A/(m K) at 200 K, surpassing conventional ferromagnets   [52–54]  and aligning with other topological materials. [20,21,27,28] The Nernst effect enables a more   straightforward  thermoelectric  module  design  compared  to  the  Seebeck  effect,  with  its   orthogonal  voltage  output.  Our  study  reveals  the  pronounced  Nernst  effect  in  ErMn6Sn6,   Finally,  we  would  like  to  address  the  distinction  between  ErMn₆Sn₆  and  the  other   RMn₆Sn₆  compounds.  When  compared  to  other  RMn₆Sn₆  compounds,  such  as  YMn₆Sn₆   [5,13,14,27] and TbMn₆Sn₆ [9–12], ErMn₆Sn₆ stands out due to its unique magnetic properties. While   YMn₆Sn₆  and  TbMn₆Sn₆  exhibit  an  AFM  phase  and  ferrimagnetic  phase  over  the  whole   AFM  phase  to  a  collinear  FIM  phase  upon  cooling.  These  transitions  are  driven  by  the   distinctive exchange interactions between Er-Mn and Mn-Mn ions, which influence both the   spin  configurations  and  the  electronic  structure  of  the  material  that  in  turn  modulates  the   For  longitudinal  transport  properties,  as  discussed  previously,  above  200  K,   magnetoresistance (MR) and magneto-Seebeck are correlated, driven by the suppression of spin   scattering in the incommensurate AFM phase. However, below 200 K, as the system gradually   field-induced changes in the electronic structure, and reduced thermal fluctuations modifies the   scattering mechanisms, which consequently lead to a sign reversal in magneto-Seebeck and a   subtle slope change in MR. Such features are not observed in other RMn6Sn6 compounds. For   the transverse transport properties, the field-induced TCS phase in ErMn₆Sn₆ results in a finite   spin chirality. This gives rise to a sizable topological Hall effect and topological Nernst effect   within  this  regime.  This  region  represents  the  boundary  between  the  incommensurate  AFM   phase — where ErMn₆Sn₆ exhibits similarities to YMn₆Sn₆ — and the FIM phase — where it   aligns  more  closely  with  TbMn₆Sn₆.  A  key  feature  of  ErMn₆Sn₆  is  the  observation  of  both   topological  Hall  effect  and  topological  Nernst  effect  in  the  low-field  regime,  with  peaks   occurring at ~1.5 T, in contrast to YMn₆Sn₆ [13,14] where the topological Hall effect is observed   at much higher fields (~5 T) and to TbMn6Sn6 [10,11] where the topological Hall effect is absent.   Above the spin-flop transition, the AHE and ANE are observed in the ferrimagnetic phase in   Figure  S6  [35]  summarizes  the  temperature  evolution  of  longitudinal  and  transport   properties from which an anomaly is observed around 200 K. These longitudinal and transverse   transport  features  underscore  the  unique  coupling  between  magnetic  order  (FIM  and   incommensurate  AFM)  and  electronic  topology  in  ErMn₆Sn₆,  which  not  only  differentiates   ErMn₆Sn₆ from other RMn₆Sn₆ compounds but also highlights its role as a bridge between the   physics  observed  in  the incommensurate  AFM  compounds  (such  as  YMn6Sn6)  and  strongly   Our  comprehensive  investigation  into  the  electronic  and  transverse  thermoelectric   for thermoelectric applications. The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), which is highly sensitive   to Berry curvature near the Fermi level, demonstrates a notable potential for ErMn6Sn6 with the   Nernst coefficient increasing with temperature and reaching a maximum value of 1.71 µV K⁻¹   at 300 K. Moreover, ErMn6Sn6 exhibits substantial topological Hall and Nernst effects, which   are associated with the non-zero spin chirality existing in the field-induced TCS phase. These   features position ErMn6Sn6 as a promising candidate for next-generation thermoelectric devices.   Single  crystals  of  ErMn6Sn6  were  synthesized  using  the  Sn  self-flux  method.  High-   purity Erbium (Er), Manganese (Mn), and Tin (Sn) with a molar ratio of 1:6:20, respectively,   were loaded into an alumina crucible which was then sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum   [29,55]. ErMn6Sn6 crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system with a space group of P6/mmm   (No. 191) with lattice constants a = b = 5.527 Å, c = 9.020 Å and crystalline angles 𝛼=𝛽=90°,   𝛾=120° [32]. The elemental composition of the crystals was confirmed using scanning electron   microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy on a JEOL 7500F ultra-high-   resolution  instrument.  Magnetic  susceptibility  measurements  were  performed  using  a  VSM-   effect measurements were conducted using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS).   A  custom-designed  sample  puck  compatible  with  the  PPMS  cryostat  was  employed  for   thermoelectric  transport  measurements.  Temperature  readings  were  acquired  using  type-E   (Chromel-Constantan)  thermocouples.  A  Keithley  K2182A  Nanovoltmeter  was  utilized  to   measure  the  thermoelectric  voltage.  The  cold  end  of  the  sample  was  affixed  to  a  high-   conductivity,  oxygen-free  copper  block  using  silver  epoxy.  A  resistive  heater  (~1  kΩ)  was   attached to the opposite (hot) end of the sample, and a heat current (JQ) was applied within the   yz (xz)-plane. The external magnetic field was oriented along the  x-axis (in-plane direction).   Note  that  the  c-axis  is  along  the  z-direction,  a-axis  along  the  x-direction,  and  b-axis  being   Olajumoke Oluwatobiloba Emmanuel and Shuvankar Gupta contributed equally to this work.

         "The precipitous rise of consumer network applications reiterates the urgency to redefine computing hardware with a low power footprint. Neuromorphic computing utilizing correlated oxides offers an energy‐efficient solution. By designing anisotropic functional properties in LSMO on a twinned LAO substrate and driving it out of thermodynamic equilibrium, two distinct negative differential resistance states are demonstrated in such volatile memristors. These are harnessed to exhibit oscillatory dynamics in LSMO at different frequencies and an artificial neuron with leaky integrate‐and‐fire dynamics. A material‐based modeling incorporating bond angle distortions in neighboring perovskites and capturing the inhomogeneity of domain distribution and propagation explains both the NDR regimes. The findings establish LSMO as an important material for neuromorphic computing hardware.",

         "High‐performance deep ultraviolet (DUV) spectroscopy is crucial in driving innovations for biomedical research, clinical diagnosis, and material science. DUV resonant nanostructures have shown capabilities for significantly improving spectroscopy sensitivity. However, they encounter significant challenges in practical applications, including instability due to oxidation and light‐induced damage, and the strong photoluminescent noise background from their constituent materials. An efficient and robust DUV spectroscopy platform based on the polaritonic properties in all‐dielectric silicon (Si) metasurfaces is proposed. Unlike conventional dielectric metasurfaces that rely on Mie‐type modes, this approach leverages the polaritonic resonances in Si nanostructures—a striking yet underexplored property driven by interband transitions in the DUV regime—for nanophotonic sensing. A polaritonic Kerker‐type void metasurface providing strong near‐field enhancement localized on the surface is designed and fabricated. The metasurface facilitates double‐resonance Raman scattering, a process that reveals key information about lattice dynamics and electronic structures, for analyzing 2D semiconductor monolayers. It also demonstrates superior stability in solvents and enhances biomolecule autofluorescence. These capabilities demonstrate the versatile potential of Si metasurfaces as a scalable, robust platform for interdisciplinary DUV spectroscopy applications, including advanced biomedical research and the investigation of emerging nanomaterials.",

In many cases, the photoluminescence signals from metasurfaces made of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthese materials can be far stronger than those from the analytes, greatly reducing their\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\neffectiveness in sensing applications.

By combining the ability to generate strong resonant surface field with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nfabrication processes, Si offers a striking platform for DUV sensing and spectroscopy.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nHere, we explore the potential of unconventional resonances in Si for a range of DUV\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninteractions between DUV light and analytes, we designed and fabricated a Kerker-resonant\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n[42-43] void metasurface, capable of generating strong field enhancement at ~266 nm.

Previously, they are observed in material systems such\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nas metals[44], polar crystals[45], and 2D materials[46]. A lesser-known but exciting fact is that Si,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\none of the most earth-abundant elements, can also exhibit strong polaritonic resonances.

Figure 1a presents the real (Re(ε), purple curve) and imaginary (Im(ε), blue\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncurve) components of Si’s permittivity from 200 nm to 500 nm, derived from experimental\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndata in Ref.[47]. The real part remains positive in the near-UV (300 to 400 nm) and visible\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nranges, confirming its dielectric nature. However, below 400 nm, the imaginary part, which\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nreflects the material absorption, rises sharply due to Si’s interband transitions. Since the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntransitions creating an absorption band in the imaginary components lead to a corresponding\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndecline in the real components. With strong oscillation strength of the transitions, the real part\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nturns negative at photon energies around the peak of the imaginary part. Negative permittivity\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nin Si is evident below 295 nm, suggesting that localized surface polaritons—requiring\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nopposite permittivity signs at the interface[37] — can be excited in Si nanostructures under\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDUV illumination (see Supporting Information for a more detailed discussion). To further\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nverify, we investigated the optical properties of a metasurface consisting of a Si nanorod\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\narray, where the design is shown in Figure 1b, by using FDTD-based commercial software\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLumerical.

Figure 2a shows a schematic of the metasurface. It consists of an\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\narray of fish-shaped voids, with the subwavelength pattern etched into a Si substrate to a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ndepth (D) of 50 nm (Figure 2b). The unit cell design can be considered as a result of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noverlapping a circular void and a fan-shaped void, and the polaritonic enhancement provided\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nby the metasurface can be effectively tuned by the geometric parameters of the void.

A resonant dip in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe metasurface is identified in the simulation, and the field enhancement progressively\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nincreases as the expanding angle decreases. For sample fabrication consideration, we choose θ\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n= 90°.

Here we demonstrate that our Si metasurface efficiently\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nenhances NADH autofluorescence. For the spectral tests, we dissolved NADH in PBS with a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nconcentration of 0.015 mM. Figure 4c shows the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsolvent. Two absorbance peaks centered at ~260 nm and ~337 nm, respectively, are identified\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin the spectrum. The absorbance peak at ~260 nm corresponds to the adenine moiety of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nNADH molecule[75]. Due to the proper overlap between the biomolecule's first absorption\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nband and the metasurface's resonance wavelength, the resonant near field generated by the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmetasurface at 266 nm can effectively enhance the excitation[76] of NADH, resulting in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstronger autofluorescence emission. The native oxide layer formed on Si in the metasurface\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nserves as a thin and uniform dielectric spacer that prevents direct contact between the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmetasurface and the excited molecules. This oxide layer and the dielectric properties of Si in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe molecular emission band prevent the quenching effects due to contact with metals[77-79].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nWe immersed the metasurface sample into the solvent and used a confocal spectroscope\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nequipped with a 266 nm continuous-wave (cw) semiconductor laser as the excitation for the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmeasurement. The confocal scheme of the spectrometer ensures the minimum influence of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nout-of-focus fluorescence signal from the background. We also simulated the field\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nenhancement of the polaritonic metasurface in the solution and confirmed that it still provides\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\na proper field enhancement at 266 nm (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). To make a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ncomparison, we measured the autofluorescence spectra from the NADH solvent on the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmetasurface (denoted as “on M.S.”) and adjacent bare Si surface (denoted as “on Si”), where\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe results are presented in Figure 4d. The results clearly show that the metasurface enhances\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nautofluorescence over the emission band from 350 to 600 nm. This can also be confirmed by\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncalculating the enhancement factor, defined as the intensity ratio between the NADH signal\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfrom the metasurface area (IM.S.) and the signal from the bare Si area (ISi), where the result is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nplotted in Figure 4e. We calculated the integrated autofluorescence intensity collected from\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe metasurface and bare Si areas and made a comparison. The NADH on the metasurface\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nshows a ~3.2-fold enhancement of the overall intensity compared with the NADH molecules\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\non the bare Si area. The enhancement factors provided by the reported polaritonic Si\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmetasurfaces are comparable to the previously reported plasmonic devices[17, 80-81]. Figure\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nS13 in Supporting Information shows a photographic image of the sample, which indicates\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthat with the enhancement of the metasurface, the autofluorescence from NADH can be\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nclearly observed (the blue spot pointed by the arrow) by a general camera. In addition, after\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe measurement, the metasurface was cleaned and observed using SEM. No apparent laser-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninduced damage or photon corrosion was detected, indicating that the Si metasurface provides\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\na robust platform for future DUV spectroscopy measurements in solvents (Figure S14). We\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nperformed photoluminescence measurements on the Si chip with the 266 nm excitation and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndid not detect any significant photoluminescence signal (Figure S15a). To compare, we also\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmeasure the photoluminescence of a 300-nm-thick AlN thin film.

Thus, it may not be suitable for DUV sensing metasurface application as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe intrinsic photoluminescence of AlN will cause strong background noise and obscure the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nspectral signals from the analyte.

For comparison, we produced Al metasurfaces (Figure S17 in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nSupporting Information) using focused ion beam milling, which shows a resonance at\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\napproximately 280 nm.

This reduction in the period also\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndecreased the minimum gap size between voids, making the metasurface more sensitive to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\npotential damage and allowing for clearer observation of any structural changes from\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWe tested the stability of the samples in three solvents: phosphate-buffered saline\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(PBS, pH 7.4), Tris-EDTA buffer solution (pH 7.6), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4, pH 6.5).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe prepared three samples and immersed them in the solvents for the stability test for both Si\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand Al metasurfaces.

After 24-hour immersion in Tris-EDTA\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbuffer, the resonance dip becomes slightly broader and red-shifted.

In the simulation, periodic boundary\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconditions were imposed along the x- and y-axis, and PML boundary conditions were used\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nalong the z-direction. The incident light is linearly polarized. The minimum mesh size is 1 nm\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin the critical regions in the simulation model. The optical constants of Si were adopted from\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nRef. [47]. In the calculation of the multipole decomposition, we calculated the electric\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndisplacement induced in the unit cell and used it for calculating the strength of the individual\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmultipoles. For the implementation, we used the MATLAB code reported in Ref. [53]. More\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nWe used electron beam lithography to make the Si metasurfaces (see Figure S18 in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe Supporting Information for the process flow). A 90-nm-thick polymethyl methacrylate\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n(PMMA 950 A2) film was spin-coated on a cleaned Si chip and baked at 180 °C for 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nminutes. In this fabrication, the PMMA layer serves a dual purpose: it defines the metasurface\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npattern during the e-beam exposure and acts as the etching mask for the etching process. This\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\napproach eliminates the need for additional metal layer evaporation and the lift-off process,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthereby enhancing fabrication efficiency. The exposure was performed by using a pattern\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ngenerator (Raith VOYAGER, acceleration voltage: 50 kV, current 0.4 nA). The exposed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsample was immediately immersed into MIBK/IPA (ratio 1:3) and rinsed in IPA for 75 and 30\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nseconds, respectively, for the development process. Subsequently, dry etching was performed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nby using an inductively coupled plasma etching system (ICP-RIE, LAM research, Model\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n2300) to transfer the pattern into the Si chip. The gas mixture for Si etching consists of Cl2\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand HBr. The PMMA layer was removed by using acetone. To correct the distortion of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresulting patterns caused by the proximity effect, the layout file used for the e-beam exposure\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwas modified, see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. To make the Al metasurfaces,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n40-nm-thick Al films were evaporated on Si chips. The base pressure is ~5×10−6 Torr, and the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nevaporation rate is ~1 nm/s. The Al films were nanopatterned by using a focus ion beam\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsystem (Helios 660 NanoLab, FEI). The acceleration voltage and beam current of the gallium\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nion beam were 30 kV and 50 pA, respectively, while the dose for the process was 210\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nµC/cm2. A commercial software NPGS (JC Nabity Lithography Systems) capable of precisely\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncontrolling the ion beam path and the dose was used in the process. The sample areas of the Si\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nTo perform the optical characterization, we built a DUV-visible micro-spectrometer\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n(see Figure S19 in the Supporting Information for the system’s schematic). A broadband\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlaser-driven plasma light source (ISTEQ, XWS-30, wavelength range: 190nm-2500 nm) was\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nused as the illumination for the reflectance measurement. Three Al-coated off-axis parabolic\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmirrors were used to shrink the spot size and make the light collimated. A polarizer cube\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(Thorlabs RPM10) is used to control the polarization of the incident light. Multiple UV-grade\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAl mirrors were used for the alignment (from Thorlabs). The sample was mounted on a three-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndimensional linear stage to control the precise position of the sample. For the Si measurement,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\na clean Si chip was used as the reference to measure the relative reflectance of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmetasurface sample, similar to the approaches reported in Ref. [92]. Multiple spectra were\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncollected for each measurement and averaged for the data presented in the paper. Similarly,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nfor the Al metasurface measurement, a clean Al mirror was used as the reference. An UV\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nachromatic objective lens (50× Mitutoyo plan UV infinity corrected objective) was used for\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe imaging, excitation, and signal collection. A spectrometer (OtO Photonics, EagleEye\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nEE2063, wavelength resolution: 0.2 nm) was used for the spectral analysis. To restrict the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrange of the incident angle, an additional pinhole with a diameter of 2 mm was mounted on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe front end of the objective lens. The spot size of the incident light is around 40 μm in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWS2 and MoS2 flakes were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition that uses\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntransition metal oxide powder and sulfur powder as the precursors.

After growth, a PMMA membrane was spin-coated on the 2D material\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nflakes, followed by thermal treatment at 100 °C for crosslinking of PMMA with the film.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNext, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and deionized water were used as transferring medium,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nand full delamination (peeling off) of the 2D material flakes from the sapphire substrates.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBecause the sapphire substrate is hydrophilic and the TMD films are hydrophobic, this action\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncan separate the 2D material from the sapphire surface, and the PMMA/2D material bilayer is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreleased and floating on water. Next, the PMMA/2D material on water is fished up onto the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsurface of the Si sample and then air-dried. To avoid delamination of the 2D materials from\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe patterned Si substrate during the PMMA removal, we anneal the sample in Argon flow at\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nA micro Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRam HR800) was used for the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsemiconductor laser (FQCW 266-50, Crystal Laser Systems) was used as the excitation. The\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsystem emits a linearly polarized DUV laser beam.

DUV resonant   due to oxidation and light-induced damage, and the strong photoluminescent noise   background from their constituent materials. We propose an efficient and robust DUV   spectroscopy platform based on the polaritonic properties in all-dielectric silicon (Si)   metasurfaces. Unlike conventional dielectric metasurfaces that rely on Mie-type modes, our   underexplored property driven by interband transitions in the DUV regime—for nanophotonic   localized on the surface was designed and fabricated. The metasurface facilitates double-   resonance Raman scattering, a process that reveals key information about lattice dynamics   and electronic structures, for analyzing 2D semiconductor monolayers. It also demonstrates   demonstrate the versatile potential of Si metasurfaces as a scalable, robust platform for   Deep ultraviolet (DUV) light, with wavelengths from 200 to 300 nm, strongly interacts   with biomolecules and materials, creating distinct spectral features in Raman scattering[1],   light counterparts. These interactions offer a valuable platform for advancing biomedical   significant efforts have been made to employ nanophotonic structures, such as metasurfaces,   interactions by confining light to the nanoscale, amplifying weak optical signals, and   In the DUV regime, only a limited number of materials are suitable for metasurfaces.   Aluminum (Al) is widely used in sensing plasmonic nanostructures[13-14]. Despite recent   oxidation[18]  and light-induced damage[19-21]  affect Al nanostructures in various sensing   protective coatings mitigate these issues, they also reduce near-field enhancement and   increase fabrication costs due to complex deposition processes. Alternatives like rhodium[23]   are hindered by limited availability and fabrication challenges. Another approach involves   measurements. In many cases, the photoluminescence signals from metasurfaces made of   these materials can be far stronger than those from the analytes, greatly reducing their   effectiveness in sensing applications. Although there are methods for fabricating diamond   nanostructures, they are not yet fully developed. To advance DUV metasurface-based sensing   We propose that Si can be the striking solution for DUV nanophotonic sensing   applications. Si is commonly regarded as a dielectric and widely used in optical   However, it exhibits a significant shift in properties in the DUV region. Strong interband   Mie-type modes with fields usually concentrated inside the resonators[8], the polaritonic   resonances in Si metasurfaces effectively confine the resonant field on the device surface at   the subwavelength scale. The exposed and enhanced field is highly beneficial for achieving   does not produce pronounced photoluminescence in the UV and visible bands, making it an   Although several works have investigated the resonance properties of Si nanostructures[38-41],   the potential for the applications of the relevant DUV surface-enhanced spectroscopy remains   largely unexplored. By combining the ability to generate strong resonant surface field with   fabrication processes, Si offers a striking platform for DUV sensing and spectroscopy.   Here, we explore the potential of unconventional resonances in Si for a range of DUV   interactions between DUV light and analytes, we designed and fabricated a Kerker-resonant   [42-43] void metasurface, capable of generating strong field enhancement at ~266 nm. As a   proof of concept, the Si metasurface successfully enhances the photoluminescence of   biomolecules over the entire emission spectrum. The metasurface also facilitates the   The results confirm the versatility of the reported Si metasurface for DUV sensing and   Surface polariton resonances are surface-bound electromagnetic modes capable of   providing significant resonant fields. Previously, they are observed in material systems such   as metals[44], polar crystals[45], and 2D materials[46]. A lesser-known but exciting fact is that Si,   one of the most earth-abundant elements, can also exhibit strong polaritonic resonances. The   change in the optical properties of Si can be clearly verified from its wavelength-dependent   optical constants. Figure 1a presents the real (Re(ε), purple curve) and imaginary (Im(ε), blue   curve) components of Si’s permittivity from 200 nm to 500 nm, derived from experimental   data in Ref.[47]. The real part remains positive in the near-UV (300 to 400 nm) and visible   ranges, confirming its dielectric nature. However, below 400 nm, the imaginary part, which   reflects the material absorption, rises sharply due to Si’s interband transitions. Since the   transitions creating an absorption band in the imaginary components lead to a corresponding   decline in the real components. With strong oscillation strength of the transitions, the real part   turns negative at photon energies around the peak of the imaginary part. Negative permittivity   in Si is evident below 295 nm, suggesting that localized surface polaritons—requiring   opposite permittivity signs at the interface[37] — can be excited in Si nanostructures under   DUV illumination (see Supporting Information for a more detailed discussion). To further   verify, we investigated the optical properties of a metasurface consisting of a Si nanorod   array, where the design is shown in Figure 1b, by using FDTD-based commercial software   Lumerical. As can be identified in the electric field distribution (Figures 1c-d) and the spectra   (Figure 1e), the Si metasurface shows two resonance modes—one in the DUV and the other   in the visible, respectively. As shown in Figure 1c, strong field enhancement and confinement   occur at the edge of the Si nanorod, indicating a surface-bound dipolar resonance at λ = 273   nm. The surface localization of the resonance can be further verified by checking the cross-   sectional electric field profile along the long axis of the Si nanorod (the bottom panel of   Figure 1c). It is found that the attenuation depth for the field in the free space and in the Si   nanorod are ~4.5 nm and ~2.2 nm, respectively. This light confinement at the deep   subwavelength scale (~0.016 λ at the Si/air interface) is a typical characteristic of the   polaritonic resonance. On the contrary, in the visible range, at 408 nm (Figure 1d), the mode   shows a typical characteristic of Mie-type resonance that field anti-nodes (as shown in the   bottom panel of Figure 1d) form in the nanorod, similar to the observation in the previous   works of Mie-type metasurfaces[8, 29]. The comparison and discussion of the results in Figure   1 clearly show the property transition of Si in the DUV regime and the impact on the   Figure 1.

R:  reflectance,  T:  transmittance,  A:   We further designed a Si metasurface capable of generating strong field enhancement   for DUV molecular sensing. Figure 2a shows a schematic of the metasurface. It consists of an   array of fish-shaped voids, with the subwavelength pattern etched into a Si substrate to a   depth (D) of 50 nm (Figure 2b). The unit cell design can be considered as a result of   overlapping a circular void and a fan-shaped void, and the polaritonic enhancement provided   by the metasurface can be effectively tuned by the geometric parameters of the void. Figure   2c illustrates the dependence of the field enhancement (upper panel) and reflectance (bottom   panel) on the expanding angle of the unit cell’s tail (denoted as θ in Figure 2b). We aimed to   achieve a design showing a resonance at ~266 nm to match the wavelength of the excitation   laser used for the surface-enhanced spectroscopy applications in this paper. A resonant dip in   the metasurface is identified in the simulation, and the field enhancement progressively   increases as the expanding angle decreases. For sample fabrication consideration, we choose θ   = 90°. This angle avoids small interspaces between the unit cells that may cause fabrication   issues, while maintaining sufficient field enhancement in the metasurface. Consequently, the   feature sizes (e.g., few nanometer gaps between unit cells) that are usually needed for gap   plasmonic devices[49-51]. In our design, the minimal feature size of the metasurface is   approximately 85 nm, making it feasible to use standard fabrication processes such as electron   metasurface shows a resonant dip in the reflectance spectrum at ~266 nm. The near-field   intensity enhancement, defined as |E/E0|2, where |E0| is the incident field amplitude, exceeds   700-fold and is majorly located on the surface of the unit cell’s neck at this wavelength (inset   of the top panel in Figure 2c). This value is comparable to several previously reported DUV   To gain further insight into the resonance properties of the metasurface, we calculated   displacement current density within the metasurface and applying the formulas described in   Ref. [53] (see Supporting Information). Figure 2(b) presents the scattering powers for the   electric dipole (ED), magnetic dipole (MD), electric quadrupole (EQ), and magnetic   perforated into films can simultaneously show strong ED and MD resonances[56-57]. At ~266   nm, the ED and MD resonances are of equal strength, providing insight into the metasurface's   strong light confinement and field enhancement. Since ED and MD are always out of phase   for backward scattering[43, 58], their equal strength will result in the significant suppression of   the device’s reflection (see Supporting Information for a more detailed discussion). This   property satisfies the first generalized Kerker condition[42-43], this concept is also used for the   realization of the Huygens’ resonance for transmissive metasurfaces[59-61]. The combination of   the opaque property of the void-type design and this Kerker-type resonance greatly enhances   the light confinement and field strength of the metasurface. In addition, we verify that the   working wavelength of the Si metasurface’s polaritonic wavelength can be effectively tuned   from 284 nm to 184 nm by changing the unit cell’s geometric parameters, see the result in   Supporting Information. We fabricated the sample on a Si chip using e-beam lithography   followed by a dry etching process. For spectral characterization, we built a DUV-Visible   micro-spectrometer. Figure 2e presents the reflectance spectrum of fabricated Si metasurface,   where the inset shows the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of the sample. In the   measurement, similar to the simulation condition, the polarization is aligned along the neck of   the fish-like voids to ensure the excitation of the resonance. This sample shows a resonance   dip, similar to the observation in the simulation results, at ~266 nm, verifying its resonance   characteristic at the target wavelength. Further details, including the fabrication process, setup   of the micro-spectrometer, effects of unit cell numbers and symmetry, the metasurface‘s   property for different polarization states, a polarization-insensitive design, and the correction   for proximity effect for the e-beam exposure, are discussed in the Experimental Section and   Supporting Information. Overall, the highly confined and enhanced surface field on the   surface will be very helpful in boosting up the light-matter interactions between the DUV   light and the analytes, resulting in amplified spectroscopy signals in the observation.

We investigated polariton-enhanced spectroscopy for nanomaterials and biomolecules   using  the  reported  Si  metasurface.  To  demonstrate  its  versatility,  we  first  performed  DUV   metasurface-enhanced  double  resonance  Raman  scattering  measurements  to  for  monolayer   tungsten  disulfide  (2D-WS₂)  and  molybdenum  disulfide  (2D-MoS₂).  They  were  selected  as   analytes  due  to  their  relevance  as  key  materials  in  next-generation  electronic[62-63]  and   optoelectronic  devices[64-65].  Their  atomically  thin  nature  makes  them  ideal  candidates  for   Resonance Raman scattering[66-67] occurs when the photon energy matches an electronic   transition  of  the  analyte,  significantly  enhancing  Raman  signals.  Additionally,  double   interactions, contribute to the scattering process, resulting in additional spectral features. This   phenomenon provides valuable insights into the electronic band structure, phonon dispersion,   and electron-phonon coupling in nanomaterials, making it highly beneficial for material physics   investigations.  The  monolayer  analytes  were  transferred  onto  two  separated  metasurfaces.   Atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM)  images  confirmed  the  successful  transfer,  as  shown  in   Figures S9a and S9b in Supporting Information. For Raman measurements in the DUV and   visible,  continuous  wave  (cw)  lasers  with  operation  wavelengths  of  266  nm  and  488  nm,   respectively, were used. The measurement results were summarized in Figure 3. In both cases,   compared to the Raman spectra of the monolayers on the adjacent bare Si substrates (Figures   3a and 3c), we observed significant enhancement of Raman signals on the metasurface areas   under DUV excitation, confirming the enhancement capability of the reported metasurface. As   shown  in  Figure  3d,  the  signals  of  MoS₂,  which  are  much  weaker  compared  with  the  Si   substrate’s Raman signal at 520 cm-1, can be overlooked under the visible excitation, even with   extended integration times. In contrast, in the metasurface-enhanced spectra, the signals of the   In detail, for 2D-WS₂, Raman peaks at 356 cm⁻¹ and 422 cm⁻¹, corresponding to the 1 (𝛤) and A1g(𝛤) modes,  were  enhanced  by  more  than  14-fold  and  7.5-fold,  respectively, E2g   compared to the bare Si area under DUV excitation. Notably, the metasurface's enhancement   performance  in  the  DUV  regime  is  similar  to  state-of-the-art  plasmonic  devices[1,  22,  68]   previously used for biomolecular analysis. Compared with the visible Raman spectrum (Figure   3b), additional peaks at around707, 763, and 825 cm⁻¹, attributed to double resonance Raman   scattering,  were  also  observed  in  the  metasurface-enhanced  DUV  Raman  spectrum.  These 2 (𝑀),  A1g(𝑀)+ peaks,  according  to  Kawata  et  al.[69],  associated  with  modes  E2g 2 (𝑀), and 2A1g(𝑀), respectively, provide detailed insights into the electronic band structure E2g   and phonon dispersion of the material. Notably, these features were barely visible or entirely   absent on the bare Si surface, further highlighting the metasurface's enhancement capability.   For  2D-MoS₂,  DUV  excitation  revealed  sharp  Raman  peaks  at  ~383  and  407  cm⁻¹, 1 (𝛤) and A1g(𝛤).

Furthermore, we observed distinct modulation of the Si Raman signal at 520   cm⁻¹ when capped with different 2D materials: the Si’s signal was enhanced with MoS₂ but not   with  WS₂.  This  discrepancy  likely  arises  from  variations  in  optical  absorption  or  coupling   strength  between  the  metasurface  and  different  2D  materials  in  the  DUV  regime.  The   underlying  mechanism  remains  unclear,  presenting  an  intriguing  opportunity  for  future   With its ability to enhance resonance Raman scattering for nanomaterials and its low   noise  background,  we  propose  the  reported  Si  metasurfaces  as  an  ideal  platform  for  DUV   Raman spectroscopy. Overall, the results highlight the metasurface's potential to significantly   enhance  resonance  Raman  scattering  in  monolayer  2D  materials,  achieving  sensitivity  to   atomic-scale thickness. These findings confirm the utility of the reported DUV metasurface for   material  differentiation  and  analysis,  with  promising  applications  in  clinical  diagnostics  and   Raman  spectra  acquired  from  the  transferred  2D-WS2  on  the  metasurface  (denoted  as  “on   M.S.”) and adjacent bare Si surface (denoted as “on Si”). b) 488-nm Raman spectrum of the   transferred  2D-WS2.

Inset  shows  the  structure  of  the  2D-WS2.  CT.:  counts  of  collected   Next, we explored the metasurface’s capability for autofluorescent biomolecular   spectroscopy (Figure 4a) in solution, which is critical for biomedical research and sensing   applications, as biomolecules often require their native environment for accurate analysis.   Autofluorescence is the intrinsic property of many biomolecules, most of which emit   biomolecular analysis and disease research, as it is useful for molecule identification and   structure is shown in Figure 4b,  is a critical coenzyme majorly associated with cellular   metabolism[72], while its autofluorescence has been found to be a vital indicator for tumor   development and aging disease[73-74]. Here we demonstrate that our Si metasurface efficiently   enhances NADH autofluorescence. For the spectral tests, we dissolved NADH in PBS with a   concentration of 0.015 mM. Figure 4c shows the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the   solvent. Two absorbance peaks centered at ~260 nm and ~337 nm, respectively, are identified   in the spectrum. The absorbance peak at ~260 nm corresponds to the adenine moiety of the   NADH molecule[75]. Due to the proper overlap between the biomolecule's first absorption   band and the metasurface's resonance wavelength, the resonant near field generated by the   metasurface at 266 nm can effectively enhance the excitation[76] of NADH, resulting in   stronger autofluorescence emission. The native oxide layer formed on Si in the metasurface   serves as a thin and uniform dielectric spacer that prevents direct contact between the   metasurface and the excited molecules. This oxide layer and the dielectric properties of Si in   the molecular emission band prevent the quenching effects due to contact with metals[77-79].   We immersed the metasurface sample into the solvent and used a confocal spectroscope   equipped with a 266 nm continuous-wave (cw) semiconductor laser as the excitation for the   measurement. The confocal scheme of the spectrometer ensures the minimum influence of the   out-of-focus fluorescence signal from the background. We also simulated the field   enhancement of the polaritonic metasurface in the solution and confirmed that it still provides   a proper field enhancement at 266 nm (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). To make a   comparison, we measured the autofluorescence spectra from the NADH solvent on the   metasurface (denoted as “on M.S.”) and adjacent bare Si surface (denoted as “on Si”), where   the results are presented in Figure 4d. The results clearly show that the metasurface enhances   autofluorescence over the emission band from 350 to 600 nm. This can also be confirmed by   calculating the enhancement factor, defined as the intensity ratio between the NADH signal   from the metasurface area (IM.S.) and the signal from the bare Si area (ISi), where the result is   plotted in Figure 4e. We calculated the integrated autofluorescence intensity collected from   the metasurface and bare Si areas and made a comparison. The NADH on the metasurface   shows a ~3.2-fold enhancement of the overall intensity compared with the NADH molecules   on the bare Si area. The enhancement factors provided by the reported polaritonic Si   metasurfaces are comparable to the previously reported plasmonic devices[17, 80-81]. Figure   S13 in Supporting Information shows a photographic image of the sample, which indicates   that with the enhancement of the metasurface, the autofluorescence from NADH can be   clearly observed (the blue spot pointed by the arrow) by a general camera. In addition, after   the measurement, the metasurface was cleaned and observed using SEM. No apparent laser-   induced damage or photon corrosion was detected, indicating that the Si metasurface provides   a robust platform for future DUV spectroscopy measurements in solvents (Figure S14). We   performed photoluminescence measurements on the Si chip with the 266 nm excitation and   did not detect any significant photoluminescence signal (Figure S15a). To compare, we also   measure the photoluminescence of a 300-nm-thick AlN thin film. Despite its low optical   absorption in the DUV and suitability for fabrication of Mie-type metasurfaces, it shows a   very bright photoluminescence (Figure S15b), with signal much stronger than NADH solution   on the Si substrate. Thus, it may not be suitable for DUV sensing metasurface application as   the intrinsic photoluminescence of AlN will cause strong background noise and obscure the   spectral signals from the analyte. The result confirms the ability of Si to provide a spectrally   clean background for sensitive spectral measurements, which is essential in spectroscopy   autofluorescence and highlight its potential for relevant biological research and clinical   Figure  4.

Finally, we test the stability of the Si metasurface in solvents commonly used in   biological protocols. In many clinical and sensing processes, it is necessary to immerse the   sensing chips in different solvents for analyte binding or surface functionalization[7]. Testing   the stability of the reported metasurfaces in the solvents can further verify their potential for   relevant applications. For comparison, we produced Al metasurfaces (Figure S17 in   Supporting Information) using focused ion beam milling, which shows a resonance at   approximately 280 nm. The period of the Si metasurface was slightly changed to 220 nm,   resulting in the resonance wavelength moving to ~245 nm. This reduction in the period also   decreased the minimum gap size between voids, making the metasurface more sensitive to   potential damage and allowing for clearer observation of any structural changes from   We tested the stability of the samples in three solvents: phosphate-buffered saline   (PBS, pH 7.4), Tris-EDTA buffer solution (pH 7.6), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4, pH 6.5).   We prepared three samples and immersed them in the solvents for the stability test for both Si   and Al metasurfaces. After specific time periods, we removed the samples from the solvent,   rinsed them with deionized (DI) water, dried them with nitrogen gas purging, and performed   spectral measurements. Overall, in the spectral measurements (red curves in Figure 5), the Si   metasurfaces demonstrated better robustness to the solvents: The resonance dip for each   sample doesn’t deteriorate significantly after the immersion in PBS (red curve in Figure 5a),   Tris-EDTA (red curve in Figure 5b), and H3PO4 (red curve in Figure 5c). The Si metasurfaces   show a resonant dip at ~250 nm. The slight spectral differences between the samples can be   associated with the imperfection in each sample. After 24-hour immersion in Tris-EDTA   buffer, the resonance dip becomes slightly broader and red-shifted. It is found that a thin film   was deposited on the top of the sample. Although the film formation mechanism is unclear   yet, it was removable using a standard RCA cleaning process[82]. After the cleaning, the   resonant dip (labeled as cleaned in Figure 5b) returns to the original spectral position before   24-hour sample immersion. In contrast, the Al metasurfaces were damaged by PBS, H3PO4,   and Tris-EDTA buffer solutions within 24 hours, 1.5 hours, and 1.5 hours, respectively, as   can be identified from the spectral measurements (the gray curves in Figure 5). These results   indicate that the reported Si metasurface is a stable platform for DUV molecular spectroscopy   Figure 5. Stability test and comparison.

In the simulation, periodic boundary   conditions were imposed along the x- and y-axis, and PML boundary conditions were used   along the z-direction. The incident light is linearly polarized. The minimum mesh size is 1 nm   in the critical regions in the simulation model. The optical constants of Si were adopted from   Ref. [47]. In the calculation of the multipole decomposition, we calculated the electric   displacement induced in the unit cell and used it for calculating the strength of the individual   multipoles. For the implementation, we used the MATLAB code reported in Ref. [53]. More   We used electron beam lithography to make the Si metasurfaces (see Figure S18 in   the Supporting Information for the process flow). A 90-nm-thick polymethyl methacrylate   (PMMA 950 A2) film was spin-coated on a cleaned Si chip and baked at 180 °C for 2   minutes. In this fabrication, the PMMA layer serves a dual purpose: it defines the metasurface   pattern during the e-beam exposure and acts as the etching mask for the etching process. This   approach eliminates the need for additional metal layer evaporation and the lift-off process,   thereby enhancing fabrication efficiency. The exposure was performed by using a pattern   generator (Raith VOYAGER, acceleration voltage: 50 kV, current 0.4 nA). The exposed   sample was immediately immersed into MIBK/IPA (ratio 1:3) and rinsed in IPA for 75 and 30   seconds, respectively, for the development process. Subsequently, dry etching was performed   by using an inductively coupled plasma etching system (ICP-RIE, LAM research, Model   2300) to transfer the pattern into the Si chip. The gas mixture for Si etching consists of Cl2   and HBr. The PMMA layer was removed by using acetone. To correct the distortion of the   resulting patterns caused by the proximity effect, the layout file used for the e-beam exposure   was modified, see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. To make the Al metasurfaces,   40-nm-thick Al films were evaporated on Si chips. The base pressure is ~5×10−6 Torr, and the   evaporation rate is ~1 nm/s. The Al films were nanopatterned by using a focus ion beam   system (Helios 660 NanoLab, FEI). The acceleration voltage and beam current of the gallium   ion beam were 30 kV and 50 pA, respectively, while the dose for the process was 210   µC/cm2. A commercial software NPGS (JC Nabity Lithography Systems) capable of precisely   controlling the ion beam path and the dose was used in the process. The sample areas of the Si   To perform the optical characterization, we built a DUV-visible micro-spectrometer   (see Figure S19 in the Supporting Information for the system’s schematic). A broadband   laser-driven plasma light source (ISTEQ, XWS-30, wavelength range: 190nm-2500 nm) was   used as the illumination for the reflectance measurement. Three Al-coated off-axis parabolic   mirrors were used to shrink the spot size and make the light collimated. A polarizer cube   (Thorlabs RPM10) is used to control the polarization of the incident light. Multiple UV-grade   Al mirrors were used for the alignment (from Thorlabs). The sample was mounted on a three-   dimensional linear stage to control the precise position of the sample. For the Si measurement,   a clean Si chip was used as the reference to measure the relative reflectance of the   metasurface sample, similar to the approaches reported in Ref. [92]. Multiple spectra were   collected for each measurement and averaged for the data presented in the paper. Similarly,   for the Al metasurface measurement, a clean Al mirror was used as the reference. An UV   achromatic objective lens (50× Mitutoyo plan UV infinity corrected objective) was used for   the imaging, excitation, and signal collection. A spectrometer (OtO Photonics, EagleEye   EE2063, wavelength resolution: 0.2 nm) was used for the spectral analysis. To restrict the   range of the incident angle, an additional pinhole with a diameter of 2 mm was mounted on   the front end of the objective lens. The spot size of the incident light is around 40 μm in   WS2 and MoS2 flakes were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition that uses   transition metal oxide powder and sulfur powder as the precursors. They grow on sapphire   substrates at 900 °C. After growth, a PMMA membrane was spin-coated on the 2D material   flakes, followed by thermal treatment at 100 °C for crosslinking of PMMA with the film.   Next, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and deionized water were used as transferring medium,   and full delamination (peeling off) of the 2D material flakes from the sapphire substrates.   Because the sapphire substrate is hydrophilic and the TMD films are hydrophobic, this action   can separate the 2D material from the sapphire surface, and the PMMA/2D material bilayer is   released and floating on water. Next, the PMMA/2D material on water is fished up onto the   surface of the Si sample and then air-dried. To avoid delamination of the 2D materials from   the patterned Si substrate during the PMMA removal, we anneal the sample in Argon flow at   A micro Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRam HR800) was used for the   semiconductor laser (FQCW 266-50, Crystal Laser Systems) was used as the excitation. The   system emits a linearly polarized DUV laser beam. A 40× DUV objective (LMU-40X-UVB,   working distance: 0.8 mm, numerical aperture (NA): 0.49) was used for the excitation and   signal collection. For the DUV Raman measurement, a grating with a groove density of 1800   gr/mm was used. The laser’s polarization was carefully aligned with the sample during   spectroscopy measurements, oriented along the neck of the fish-shaped void unit cell.The   incident power is 2.25 mW.  For the visible Raman measurement, a 488-nm laser (Stellar-Pro,   Modu-Laser, LLC) was coupled into the spectrometer system and used as the excitation.

         "Solar heating through windows significantly increases thermal loads in buildings, vehicles, and greenhouses. In particular, overheating in parked vehicles under direct sunlight poses serious safety risks, with numerous reports linking high interior temperatures to heat‐related fatalities among children and pets. To address this challenge, a durable thermochromic hydrogel with a dual‐network structure of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and polyacrylamide (PAAM), enhanced by calcium chloride (CaCl2) for tunable transition temperature is developed. Through ion chelation and hydrogen bonding, the hydrogel transitions between transparent and opaque states across a wide temperature range (15–42 °C), adapting to various environments. Encapsulated in acrylic sheets as smart windows, the hydrogel achieves passive cooling, reducing vehicle interior temperatures by up to 10 °C under direct sunlight. The material also exhibits excellent mechanical strength, water retention, and long‐term stability (400 thermal cycles), ensuring real‐world reliability. These results demonstrate the hydrogel's potential for scalable applications in vehicles, sustainable building facades, and greenhouse coverings, offering an energy‐efficient, eco‐friendly solution for thermal management. Unlike existing technologies requiring external power or complex fabrication, the hydrogel operates passively, making it a cost‐effective and sustainable alternative. This innovation addresses critical safety and energy challenges while advancing next‐generation energy‐efficient materials and global sustainability goals.",

         "Layer‐by‐layer (LbL) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are fabricated with polymer PM1 as donor and small molecule L8‐BO as acceptor by employing sequential spin‐coating technology. The small molecule BTP‐eC9 and polymer PTAA are deliberately selected for individually incorporating into PM1 layer and L8‐BO layer, resulting in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 18.22% to 19.23%. The improvement of performance is attributed to the synergistically increased short circuit current density (JSC) of 27.78 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 78.23%. The introduction of BTP‐eC9 into PM1 layer can promote the photogenerated exciton dissociation, especially for the excitons near the anode. Meanwhile, molecular crystallinity of PM1 is also enhanced by incorporating appropriate BTP‐eC9 into PM1 layer. The incorporation of PTAA into L8‐BO layer can provide hole transport channels to effectively improve the transport of holes generated by the self‐dissociation of L8‐BO, resulting in the enhanced FFs from 77.40% to 78.23%. The synergistic effects of BTP‐eC9 and PTAA incorporation in donor and acceptor layers result in a 19.23% PCE of the optimized LbL‐OPVs. This work demonstrates that there is great room to hierarchically optimize donor and acceptor layers for achieving highly efficient LbL‐OPVs.",

         "With the rapid advancement of 2D material‐based optoelectronic devices, significant progress is made in the development of all‐optical logic devices, synaptic biomimetic devices, and multidimensional detection systems. As entering to the high‐speed information era, there is an urgent demand for complex, compact, multifunctional, low‐energy, and high‐speed intelligent sensing chips. Examining the evolution of current technologies reveals a parallel in the advancement of bipolar response mechanisms‐from simple positive and negative responses to more intricate inhibition‐promotion dynamics with persistent characteristics. This evolution significantly broadens their applications in biomimetic devices. Moreover, compared to unipolar responses, complex bipolar responses offer greater flexibility in adaptation and a unique one‐to‐one mapping with high‐dimensional information parameters such as polarization, phase, and spectrum, positioning them as promising candidates for breakthroughs in multidimensional detection and resolution. In this review, design strategies are comprehensively explored for various bipolar responses in 2D materials, highlighting their deep applications and progress in advanced fields. It is aimed for this review to provide a broad overview of bi‐directional response mechanisms, offering inspiration for designing the next generation of intelligent sensing chips.",

The THINGS initiative provides a large EEG dataset of\n46 subjects watching rapidly shown images. Here, we test the feasibility of\nusing this method for decoding high-level object features using recent deep\nlearning models. We create a derivative dataset from this of living vs\nnon-living entities test 15 different deep learning models with 5 different\narchitectures and compare to a SOTA linear model. We show that the linear model\nis not able to solve the decoding task, while almost all the deep learning\nmodels are successful, suggesting that in some cases non-linear models are\nneeded to decode neural representations. We also run a comparative study of the\nmodels' performance on individual object categories, and suggest how artificial\nneural networks can be used to study brain activity.\n",

         "  Nonequilibrium plasmas generated by spark discharges induce chemical,\nthermal, and flow dynamic effects that are beneficial in many applications such\nas plasmalysis, plasma-assisted combustion, and plasma flow control. Among the\nflow dynamic effects generated by these discharges, vorticity is of particular\ninterest because it enhances the mixing of the discharge products with the\nsurrounding environment and accelerates the cooling of the kernel. This article\nprovides a comprehensive examination of the vorticity produced by nanosecond\ndischarges in air. Using computational fluid dynamic simulations of the blast\nwave resulting from energy deposition in the interelectrode volume during the\nnanosecond pulse, we analyze the various sources of vorticity during the\npost-discharge period. The non-uniform strength of the leading shock of the\nblast wave is found to be the primary promoter of vorticity. Other sources,\nsuch as the barocline torque, play a secondary role in explaining the overall\nrecirculation pattern. In addition, the discharge cooling mechanisms are also\ninvestigated. The cooling regimes and their efficiencies are classified\naccording to the discharge parameters, such as the inter-electrode gap, the\ninitial kernel temperature, or the frequency of repetitive pulses. Finally, a\nphysics-based, non-dimensional number PI* , equal to the ratio of the initial\nkernel temperature to the ambient temperature, is introduced. A numerical\nanalysis shows that the transition between the recirculating and\nnon-recirculating flow regimes occurs for PI* on the order of 10. This\ncriterion is validated against experimental and numerical results from the\nliterature.\n",

In this paper, we are interested in\nfundamentally understanding the potential of emerging sensing modalities (e.g.,\nWiFi) for neurological gait disorder assessment. Towards this goal, we conduct\na one-year-long clinical trial in collaboration with the Neurology Associates\nof Santa Barbara, the results of which are detailed in this paper. More\nspecifically, our medical campaign encompasses 114 real subjects and a wide\nspectrum of disorders (e.g., Parkinson's, Neuropathy, Post Stroke, Dementia,\nand Arthritis). We then develop the first WiFi-based gait disorder sensing\nsystem of its kind, distinguished by its scope of validation with a large and\ndiverse patient cohort. To ensure generalizability, we mainly leverage\npublicly-accessible online videos of gait disorders for training, and develop a\nvideo-to-RF pipeline to convert them to synthetic RF data. We then extensively\ntest the system in a neurology center (i.e., the Neurology Associates of Santa\nBarbara). In addition, we provide a 1-1 comparison with a vision-based system,\nby developing a vision-based gait disorder assessment system under the same\nexact conditions (e.g., same subjects, etc), a comparison crucial for\ndeveloping smart health systems and the first of its kind to our knowledge. We\nfinally contrast both systems with the accuracy of neurologists when basing\nevaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait, by designing a large\nsurvey and distributing it to an extensive network of neurologists, thus\noffering the first such apples-to-apples comparison of these three sensing\nmodalities. Overall, the findings can shape the integration of new sensing\nmodalities into medical practice, and pave the way toward equitable healthcare.\n",

However, swiftly teaching a\nrobot to grasp a novel target object in clutter remains challenging. This paper\nattempts to address the challenge by leveraging object attributes that\nfacilitate recognition, grasping, and rapid adaptation to new domains. In this\nwork, we present an end-to-end encoder-decoder network to learn attribute-based\nrobotic grasping with data-efficient adaptation capability. We first pre-train\nthe end-to-end model with a variety of basic objects to learn generic attribute\nrepresentation for recognition and grasping. Our approach fuses the embeddings\nof a workspace image and a query text using a gated-attention mechanism and\nlearns to predict instance grasping affordances. To train the joint embedding\nspace of visual and textual attributes, the robot utilizes object persistence\nbefore and after grasping. Our model is self-supervised in a simulation that\nonly uses basic objects of various colors and shapes but generalizes to novel\nobjects in new environments. To further facilitate generalization, we propose\ntwo adaptation methods, adversarial adaption and one-grasp adaptation.\nAdversarial adaptation regulates the image encoder using augmented data of\nunlabeled images, whereas one-grasp adaptation updates the overall end-to-end\nmodel using augmented data from one grasp trial. Both adaptation methods are\ndata-efficient and considerably improve instance grasping performance.\nExperimental results in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that our\napproach achieves over 81% instance grasping success rate on unknown objects,\nwhich outperforms several baselines by large margins.\n",

         "Carbon plays key roles in the InterStellar Medium (ISM) -- as a constituent of dust, as the carrier of the dominant far-infrared cooling line, and as a component of various important molecules. But despite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared. We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of Galactic [CII] absorption along the IC342 sightline, although it requires disentangling [CII] emission from IC342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA study informs the prospects for [CII] absorption measurements with future facilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR telescopes -- PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins -- to detect [CII] absorption. We find that all four facilities would be able to detect [CII] absorption along a significant number of sightlines.",

Herein, we report the preparation of a series of\nelectrocatalysts based on octadecyl amine (ODA) coated Cu2O nanoparticles.\nHRTEM images show ODA coatings with thickness from 1.2 to 4 nm. DFT\ncalculations predict that at low surface coverage, ODA tends to lay on the Cu2O\nsurface, leaving hydrophilic regions.

At the optimum thickness, the\nintermediates desorption rates are the slowest, in agreement with the maximum\nconcentration of intermediates observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, thereby\nresulting in a Faradaic efficiency to ethanol and ethylene over 73 %.\n",

The THz drive of its Mott insulating state induces instantaneous IMT via quantum tunneling of valence electrons across the bandgap while the THz drive of its correlated metallic state leads to overall heating of the conduction electrons. The subsequent relaxations of excited electrons in these two states occur via a two-step process (electron-phonon thermalization and recovery of the charge-ordered insulating state) and a one-step process (electron-phonon scattering), respectively. The relaxation dynamics of the electrons and the absence of acoustic phonon modes, in particular, suggest that the THz photons drive only the charge degree of freedom. The purely electronic, ultrafast and local nature of the THz-induced IMT offers its applications in opto-electronics with enhanced performance and minimal device size and heat dissipation.",

Furthermore, how much anisotropy the electrical\nproperties of WP2 have and whether its electrical anisotropy can be tuned\nremain elusive.

Moreover, the measured ratio (Rc/Ra) between the crystalline\nc-axis and a-axis electrical resistivities exhibits a weak dependence on\ntemperature from 100 to 250 K, but increases abruptly below 100 K, and then\nreaches the value of 8.0 at 10 K, which is by far the strongest in-plane\nelectrical resistivity anisotropy among the reported type-II WSM candidates\nwith comparable carrier concentrations. Our optical-spectroscopy and\ncalculation studies reveal that the abrupt enhancement of the Rc/Ra below 100 K\nmainly arises from a sharp increase in the scattering rate anisotropy at low\ntemperatures.

Different\nstacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature\ndistributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains\nsimilar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on\nthe quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4$^\\circ$ twisted double\nbilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB-AB, AB-BA)\nand forms an inversion broken \\moire superlattice with electrically tunable\nflat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking\norder, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in\nBerry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD\nexhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the\nperpendicular electric field in AB-AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric\nbehavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity\nin AB-BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking-induced quantum\ngeometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and\ndetection.\n",

Experiments so far have established the mechanical responses to the\nlong-range ordered or isolated single spin states. However, it remains elusive\nwhether mechanical motions can couple to a different type of magnetic\nstructure, the non-collinear spin textures, which exhibit nanoscale spatial\nvariations of spin (domain walls, skyrmions, etc.) and are promising candidates\nto realize high-speed computing devices. Here, we report the detection of\ncollective spin texture dynamics with nanoelectromechanical resonators made of\ntwo-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS3 with $10^{-9}$ strain\nsensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under\nmagnetic fields, new magnetic transitions were identified with sharp dips in\nresonant frequency. They are attributed to the collective AFM domain wall\nmotions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and\nlarge-scale spin-dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large\nmodulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a\nfluid-like response due to the ultrafast domain motion.

Despite recent advances in understanding metastable skyrmions, the interplay between compositional disorder and varying magnetic anisotropy on the stability and decay of metastable textures, particularly near room temperature, remains incompletely understood. In this work, the equilibrium and metastable skyrmion formation in Co$_{8}$Zn$_{9}$Mn$_{3}$ is examined, revealing transformations between distinct metastable spin textures induced by temperature and magnetic field. At room temperature, the decay dynamics of metastable skyrmions exhibits a strong dependence on magnetic anisotropy, showcasing a route towards tailoring relaxation behavior. Furthermore, a nascent double-$q$ spin texture, characterized by two coexisting magnetic modulation vectors $q$, is identified as a minority phase alongside the conventional triple-$q$ hexagonal skyrmion lattice. This double-$q$ texture can be quenched as a metastable state, suggesting both its topological character, and its role as a potential intermediary of metastable skyrmion decay. These findings provide new insights into the tunability of equilibrium and metastable topological spin textures via chemical composition and magnetic anisotropy, offering strategies for designing materials with customizable and dynamic skyrmion properties for advanced technological applications.",

Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) defects have been identified in a range of perovskite semiconductors, including CsPbI3. However, there is limited understanding as to why they form or their impact on stability and photophysical properties. Here we increase the prevalence of RP defects with increased Cs-excess in vapour-deposited CsPbI3 thin films and observe superior structural stability but inferior photophysical properties. Significantly, using electron microscopy, we find that the atomic positions at the planar defect are comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilisation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the RP planes are electronically benign, however, antisites observed at RP turning points are likely to be malign. We therefore propose that increasing RP planes while reducing RP turning points could offer a breakthrough for improving both phase stability and photophysical performance. The formation mechanism revealed here may well apply more generally to RP structures in other perovskite systems.",

         "Nodal-line semimetals are a class of topological materials hosting one dimensional lines of band degeneracy. Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.",

         "FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructure is a promising new platform in the journey toward topological quantum computation, considering that first, FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ is itself known to be a topological superconductor (TSC) and second, the heterostructure has topological interface states that can be proximitized into TSC even if FTS fails to become TSC on its own. Here, we show that this system exhibits quasi-2D superconductivity, and utilizing the standard in-plane magneto-transport measurements, we discover two-fold anisotropy (a.k.a nematicity) in R$_{xx}$ and I$_c$ measurement, even though the system exhibits globally 12-fold symmetry. Then, we carried out similar measurements on a polycrystalline niobium (Nb) thin film, a well-known s-wave elemental superconductor, and found a similar two-fold symmetry even for this Nb system. This implies either that nematic behavior is ubiquitous or that the in-plane magneto-transport measurement scheme routinely used to detect nematicity is not a reliable method to probe nematicity. We show that the angle-dependent response of vortices in the superconducting regime to the magnetic Lorentz force is very likely the main cause behind the ubiquitous nematic behaviors of this measurement scheme. In other words, this measurement scheme is intrinsically two-fold, and is therefore not suitable to detect the nematicity. Accordingly, all the previous reports of nematicity based on similar measurement practices, reported on various samples, including thin films, bulk crystals, and exfoliated flakes, need to be reinterpreted.",

Using a continuously updating gallery, we were able to increase our\nmean Rank-1 accuracy by 24%, as material aging was taken into account step by\nstep. In addition, using models trained with 10% artificial training data,\nRank-1 accuracy could be increased by up to 13%, in comparison to a model\ntrained on only real-world data, significantly boosting generalized performance\non hold-out data. Finally, this work introduces a novel, open-source\nre-identification dataset, pallet-block-2696. This dataset contains 2,696\nimages of Euro pallets, taken over a period of 4 months. During this time,\nnatural aging processes occurred and some of the pallets were damaged during\ntheir usage. These wear and tear processes significantly changed the appearance\nof the pallets, providing a dataset that can be used to generate synthetically\naged pallets or other wooden materials.\n",

This enables us to design an algorithm to sample synthetic networks that preserves the $d$-hop neighborhood structure of a given temporal network. The higher $d$ is chosen, the better the temporal neighborhood structure of the original network is preserved. Specifically, we provide efficient algorithms that preserve time-respecting (\"causal\") paths in the networks up to length $d$, and scale to real-world network sizes. We validate our approach theoretically (for Degree and Katz centrality) and experimentally (for edge persistence, causal triangles, and burstiness). An experimental comparison shows that our method retains these key temporal characteristics more effectively than existing randomization methods.",

         "Generative models capture the true distribution of data, yielding semantically rich representations. Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) exhibit superior generative capabilities, though efficient representation learning for them are lacking. In this work, we employ a multi-level denoising autoencoder framework to expand the representation capacity of DDMs, which introduces sequentially consistent Diffusion Transformers and an additional timestep-dependent encoder to acquire embedding representations on the denoising Markov chain through self-conditional diffusion learning. Intuitively, the encoder, conditioned on the entire diffusion process, compresses high-dimensional data into directional vectors in latent under different noise levels, facilitating the learning of image embeddings across all timesteps. To verify the semantic adequacy of embeddings generated through this approach, extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, demonstrating that optimally learned embeddings by DDMs surpass state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning methods in most cases, achieving remarkable discriminative semantic representation quality. Our work justifies that DDMs are not only suitable for generative tasks, but also potentially advantageous for general-purpose deep learning applications.",

In our previous research we described methodology and a tool to generate, in automated fashion, smart contracts from BPMN models. The generated smart contracts provide support for multi-step transactions that facilitate repair/upgrade of smart contracts. In this paper we show how the approach is used to support collaborations via smart contracts for companies ranging from SMEs with little IT capabilities to companies with IT using blockchain smart contracts. Furthermore, we also show how the approach is used for certain applications to generate smart contracts by a BPMN modeler who does not need any knowledge of blockchain technology or smart contract development - thus we are hoping to facilitate democratization of smart contracts and blockchain technology.",

To ease the developer's task of writing smart contract, as other research efforts, we also use Business Process Model and Notation BPMN modeling to describe application requirements for trade of goods and services and then transform automatically the BPMN model into the methods of a smart contract. In our previous research we described our approach and a tool to Transform Automatically BPMN models into Smart contracts TABS. In this paper, we describe how the TABS approach is augmented with the support for a BPMN collaborative transaction by several actors. Our approach analyzes the BPMN model to determine which patterns in the BPMN model are suitable for use as collaborative transactions. The found BPMN patterns that are suitable as transactions are shown to the developer who decides which ones should be deployed as collaborative transactions. We describe how our approach automatically transform the BPMN model into smart contract the provides a transaction mechanism to enforce the transactional properties of the nested transactions. Our approach greatly reduces the developers task as synchronization of collaborative activities is provided by our approach, so that the developer needs to code only independent tasks with well-defined inputs and outputs. We also overview the TABS+ tool we built as a proof of concept to show that our approach is feasible.

In FL, a central parameter server coordinates the learning process by iteratively aggregating the trained models received from clients. Yet, deploying a central server is not always feasible due to hardware unavailability, infrastructure constraints, or operational costs. We present Plexus, a fully decentralized FL system for large networks that operates without the drawbacks originating from having a central server. Plexus distributes the responsibilities of model aggregation and sampling among participating nodes while avoiding network-wide coordination. We evaluate Plexus using realistic traces for compute speed, pairwise latency and network capacity. Our experiments on three common learning tasks and with up to 1000 nodes empirically show that Plexus reduces time-to-accuracy by 1.4-1.6x, communication volume by 15.8-292x and training resources needed for convergence by 30.5-77.9x compared to conventional decentralized learning algorithms.",

We achieve this through\na strategic row- and column-wise decomposition of expert matrices. This reduces\nidle time and avoids bottlenecks caused by imbalanced expert assignments.\nFurthermore, MoEShard minimizes kernel launches by fusing decomposed expert\ncomputations, significantly improving throughput. We evaluate MoEShard against\nDeepSpeed on encoder-based architectures, demonstrating speedups of up to\n6.4$\\times$ in time to first token (TTFT).

All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n",

The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts\nthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate\nabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).\n",
