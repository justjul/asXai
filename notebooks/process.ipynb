         "  Nonequilibrium plasmas generated by spark discharges induce chemical,\nthermal, and flow dynamic effects that are beneficial in many applications such\nas plasmalysis, plasma-assisted combustion, and plasma flow control. Among the\nflow dynamic effects generated by these discharges, vorticity is of particular\ninterest because it enhances the mixing of the discharge products with the\nsurrounding environment and accelerates the cooling of the kernel. This article\nprovides a comprehensive examination of the vorticity produced by nanosecond\ndischarges in air. Using computational fluid dynamic simulations of the blast\nwave resulting from energy deposition in the interelectrode volume during the\nnanosecond pulse, we analyze the various sources of vorticity during the\npost-discharge period. The non-uniform strength of the leading shock of the\nblast wave is found to be the primary promoter of vorticity. Other sources,\nsuch as the barocline torque, play a secondary role in explaining the overall\nrecirculation pattern. In addition, the discharge cooling mechanisms are also\ninvestigated. The cooling regimes and their efficiencies are classified\naccording to the discharge parameters, such as the inter-electrode gap, the\ninitial kernel temperature, or the frequency of repetitive pulses. Finally, a\nphysics-based, non-dimensional number PI* , equal to the ratio of the initial\nkernel temperature to the ambient temperature, is introduced. A numerical\nanalysis shows that the transition between the recirculating and\nnon-recirculating flow regimes occurs for PI* on the order of 10. This\ncriterion is validated against experimental and numerical results from the\nliterature.\n",

In this paper, we are interested in\nfundamentally understanding the potential of emerging sensing modalities (e.g.,\nWiFi) for neurological gait disorder assessment. Towards this goal, we conduct\na one-year-long clinical trial in collaboration with the Neurology Associates\nof Santa Barbara, the results of which are detailed in this paper. More\nspecifically, our medical campaign encompasses 114 real subjects and a wide\nspectrum of disorders (e.g., Parkinson's, Neuropathy, Post Stroke, Dementia,\nand Arthritis). We then develop the first WiFi-based gait disorder sensing\nsystem of its kind, distinguished by its scope of validation with a large and\ndiverse patient cohort. To ensure generalizability, we mainly leverage\npublicly-accessible online videos of gait disorders for training, and develop a\nvideo-to-RF pipeline to convert them to synthetic RF data. We then extensively\ntest the system in a neurology center (i.e., the Neurology Associates of Santa\nBarbara). In addition, we provide a 1-1 comparison with a vision-based system,\nby developing a vision-based gait disorder assessment system under the same\nexact conditions (e.g., same subjects, etc), a comparison crucial for\ndeveloping smart health systems and the first of its kind to our knowledge. We\nfinally contrast both systems with the accuracy of neurologists when basing\nevaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait, by designing a large\nsurvey and distributing it to an extensive network of neurologists, thus\noffering the first such apples-to-apples comparison of these three sensing\nmodalities. Overall, the findings can shape the integration of new sensing\nmodalities into medical practice, and pave the way toward equitable healthcare.\n",

         "  Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental robotic manipulation tasks\nand has been the subject of extensive research. However, swiftly teaching a\nrobot to grasp a novel target object in clutter remains challenging. This paper\nattempts to address the challenge by leveraging object attributes that\nfacilitate recognition, grasping, and rapid adaptation to new domains. In this\nwork, we present an end-to-end encoder-decoder network to learn attribute-based\nrobotic grasping with data-efficient adaptation capability. We first pre-train\nthe end-to-end model with a variety of basic objects to learn generic attribute\nrepresentation for recognition and grasping. Our approach fuses the embeddings\nof a workspace image and a query text using a gated-attention mechanism and\nlearns to predict instance grasping affordances. To train the joint embedding\nspace of visual and textual attributes, the robot utilizes object persistence\nbefore and after grasping. Our model is self-supervised in a simulation that\nonly uses basic objects of various colors and shapes but generalizes to novel\nobjects in new environments. To further facilitate generalization, we propose\ntwo adaptation methods, adversarial adaption and one-grasp adaptation.\nAdversarial adaptation regulates the image encoder using augmented data of\nunlabeled images, whereas one-grasp adaptation updates the overall end-to-end\nmodel using augmented data from one grasp trial. Both adaptation methods are\ndata-efficient and considerably improve instance grasping performance.\nExperimental results in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that our\napproach achieves over 81% instance grasping success rate on unknown objects,\nwhich outperforms several baselines by large margins.\n",

Employing a\ndual-temperature control system, we independently manipulate the cell body and\nstem temperatures to explore Doppler and collisional effects on the spectrum.\nOur results show how the Voigt spectral profile changes from Gaussian- to\nLorentzian-dominated forms due to pressure broadening and shifts caused by\ncollisions between potassium atoms and neon.

Time-resolved\npump-probe reflectivity measurements reveal a strong anisotropy in the\nphotoinduced response, which is a direct consequence of the material's unique\nelectronic structure. The temperature dependence of the relaxation dynamics\nprovides evidence for the formation of two distinct hybridization gaps that\nappear at different temperatures in the heavy fermion state. A direct gap of\n2$\\Delta_{dir}$ $\\approx$ 50 meV that persists up to $T^\\dag$ $\\approx$ 90 K,\nwell above the coherence temperature $T^*$ $\\approx$ 20 K.

Furthermore, we\nfind that the hybridization gap can be suppressed with increasing pump fluence,\nindicating a delicate interplay between photoexcitation and the coherent heavy\nfermion state.

         "Carbon plays key roles in the InterStellar Medium (ISM) -- as a constituent of dust, as the carrier of the dominant far-infrared cooling line, and as a component of various important molecules. But despite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared. We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of Galactic [CII] absorption along the IC342 sightline, although it requires disentangling [CII] emission from IC342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA study informs the prospects for [CII] absorption measurements with future facilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR telescopes -- PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins -- to detect [CII] absorption. We find that all four facilities would be able to detect [CII] absorption along a significant number of sightlines.",

This paper introduces a\nmulti-agent system designed to extract and analyze these narrative arcs. Tested\non the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-), the system identifies three\ntypes of arcs: Anthology (self-contained), Soap (relationship-focused), and\nGenre-Specific (strictly related to the series' genre). Episodic progressions\nof these arcs are stored in both relational and semantic (vectorial) databases,\nenabling structured analysis and comparison. To bridge the gap between\nautomation and critical interpretation, the system is paired with a graphical\ninterface that allows for human refinement using tools to enhance and visualize\nthe data. The system performed strongly in identifying Anthology Arcs and\ncharacter entities, but its reliance on textual paratexts (such as episode\nsummaries) revealed limitations in recognizing overlapping arcs and subtler\ndynamics. This approach highlights the potential of combining computational and\nhuman expertise in narrative analysis. Beyond television, it offers promise for\nserialized written formats, where the narrative resides entirely in the text.\nFuture work will explore the integration of multimodal inputs, such as dialogue\nand visuals, and expand testing across a wider range of genres to refine the\nsystem further.\n",

         "  Neural decoding is an important method in cognitive neuroscience that aims to\ndecode brain representations from recorded neural activity using a multivariate\nmachine learning model. The THINGS initiative provides a large EEG dataset of\n46 subjects watching rapidly shown images. Here, we test the feasibility of\nusing this method for decoding high-level object features using recent deep\nlearning models. We create a derivative dataset from this of living vs\nnon-living entities test 15 different deep learning models with 5 different\narchitectures and compare to a SOTA linear model. We show that the linear model\nis not able to solve the decoding task, while almost all the deep learning\nmodels are successful, suggesting that in some cases non-linear models are\nneeded to decode neural representations. We also run a comparative study of the\nmodels' performance on individual object categories, and suggest how artificial\nneural networks can be used to study brain activity.\n",

         "  Nonequilibrium plasmas generated by spark discharges induce chemical,\nthermal, and flow dynamic effects that are beneficial in many applications such\nas plasmalysis, plasma-assisted combustion, and plasma flow control. Among the\nflow dynamic effects generated by these discharges, vorticity is of particular\ninterest because it enhances the mixing of the discharge products with the\nsurrounding environment and accelerates the cooling of the kernel. This article\nprovides a comprehensive examination of the vorticity produced by nanosecond\ndischarges in air. Using computational fluid dynamic simulations of the blast\nwave resulting from energy deposition in the interelectrode volume during the\nnanosecond pulse, we analyze the various sources of vorticity during the\npost-discharge period. The non-uniform strength of the leading shock of the\nblast wave is found to be the primary promoter of vorticity. Other sources,\nsuch as the barocline torque, play a secondary role in explaining the overall\nrecirculation pattern. In addition, the discharge cooling mechanisms are also\ninvestigated. The cooling regimes and their efficiencies are classified\naccording to the discharge parameters, such as the inter-electrode gap, the\ninitial kernel temperature, or the frequency of repetitive pulses. Finally, a\nphysics-based, non-dimensional number PI* , equal to the ratio of the initial\nkernel temperature to the ambient temperature, is introduced. A numerical\nanalysis shows that the transition between the recirculating and\nnon-recirculating flow regimes occurs for PI* on the order of 10. This\ncriterion is validated against experimental and numerical results from the\nliterature.\n",

         "  Neurological gait disorders can affect a large population, with devastating\nconsequences on the quality of life. In this paper, we are interested in\nfundamentally understanding the potential of emerging sensing modalities (e.g.,\nWiFi) for neurological gait disorder assessment. Towards this goal, we conduct\na one-year-long clinical trial in collaboration with the Neurology Associates\nof Santa Barbara, the results of which are detailed in this paper. More\nspecifically, our medical campaign encompasses 114 real subjects and a wide\nspectrum of disorders (e.g., Parkinson's, Neuropathy, Post Stroke, Dementia,\nand Arthritis). We then develop the first WiFi-based gait disorder sensing\nsystem of its kind, distinguished by its scope of validation with a large and\ndiverse patient cohort. To ensure generalizability, we mainly leverage\npublicly-accessible online videos of gait disorders for training, and develop a\nvideo-to-RF pipeline to convert them to synthetic RF data. We then extensively\ntest the system in a neurology center (i.e., the Neurology Associates of Santa\nBarbara). In addition, we provide a 1-1 comparison with a vision-based system,\nby developing a vision-based gait disorder assessment system under the same\nexact conditions (e.g., same subjects, etc), a comparison crucial for\ndeveloping smart health systems and the first of its kind to our knowledge. We\nfinally contrast both systems with the accuracy of neurologists when basing\nevaluation solely on the visual inspection of the gait, by designing a large\nsurvey and distributing it to an extensive network of neurologists, thus\noffering the first such apples-to-apples comparison of these three sensing\nmodalities. Overall, the findings can shape the integration of new sensing\nmodalities into medical practice, and pave the way toward equitable healthcare.\n",

         "  Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental robotic manipulation tasks\nand has been the subject of extensive research. However, swiftly teaching a\nrobot to grasp a novel target object in clutter remains challenging. This paper\nattempts to address the challenge by leveraging object attributes that\nfacilitate recognition, grasping, and rapid adaptation to new domains. In this\nwork, we present an end-to-end encoder-decoder network to learn attribute-based\nrobotic grasping with data-efficient adaptation capability. We first pre-train\nthe end-to-end model with a variety of basic objects to learn generic attribute\nrepresentation for recognition and grasping. Our approach fuses the embeddings\nof a workspace image and a query text using a gated-attention mechanism and\nlearns to predict instance grasping affordances. To train the joint embedding\nspace of visual and textual attributes, the robot utilizes object persistence\nbefore and after grasping. Our model is self-supervised in a simulation that\nonly uses basic objects of various colors and shapes but generalizes to novel\nobjects in new environments. To further facilitate generalization, we propose\ntwo adaptation methods, adversarial adaption and one-grasp adaptation.\nAdversarial adaptation regulates the image encoder using augmented data of\nunlabeled images, whereas one-grasp adaptation updates the overall end-to-end\nmodel using augmented data from one grasp trial. Both adaptation methods are\ndata-efficient and considerably improve instance grasping performance.\nExperimental results in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that our\napproach achieves over 81% instance grasping success rate on unknown objects,\nwhich outperforms several baselines by large margins.\n",

Understanding how visual attention is allocated is essential for optimizing interface design. However, collecting Eye-tracking (ET) data presents challenges related to cost, privacy, and scalability. Computational models provide alternatives for predicting gaze patterns, thereby advancing InfoVis research. In our study, we conducted an ET experiment with 40 participants who analyzed graphs while responding to questions of varying complexity within the context of digital forensics. We compared human scanpaths with synthetic ones generated by models such as DeepGaze, UMSS, and Gazeformer. Our research evaluates the accuracy of these models and examines how question complexity and number of nodes influence performance.

Employing a\ndual-temperature control system, we independently manipulate the cell body and\nstem temperatures to explore Doppler and collisional effects on the spectrum.\nOur results show how the Voigt spectral profile changes from Gaussian- to\nLorentzian-dominated forms due to pressure broadening and shifts caused by\ncollisions between potassium atoms and neon. Our measurements are in excellent\nagreement with the literature values for potassium-neon collisions. For the\nfirst time we were able to incorporate the buffer-gas shift and broadening into\nthe modified Voigt profile via the ElecSus code, and found excellent agreement\nbetween the predicted and measured line profiles. We also analyse the potassium\nD1 spectral lines in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime using strong magnetic\nfields, demonstrating how Zeeman splitting modifies the pressure-broadened line\nshape.

Time-resolved\npump-probe reflectivity measurements reveal a strong anisotropy in the\nphotoinduced response, which is a direct consequence of the material's unique\nelectronic structure. The temperature dependence of the relaxation dynamics\nprovides evidence for the formation of two distinct hybridization gaps that\nappear at different temperatures in the heavy fermion state. A direct gap of\n2$\\Delta_{dir}$ $\\approx$ 50 meV that persists up to $T^\\dag$ $\\approx$ 90 K,\nwell above the coherence temperature $T^*$ $\\approx$ 20 K. We attribute this\nhigher-temperature gap to the hybridization fluctuations. An indirect gap of\n2$\\Delta_{ind}$ $\\approx$ 10 meV opens closer to $T^*$, signifying the\ndevelopment of long-range coherence in the heavy fermion state. Furthermore, we\nfind that the hybridization gap can be suppressed with increasing pump fluence,\nindicating a delicate interplay between photoexcitation and the coherent heavy\nfermion state. Our results provide insights into the interplay of Kondo physics\nand low dimensionality in CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, and establish ultrafast optical\nspectroscopy as a sensitive probe of anisotropic hybridization in heavy fermion\nmaterials.\n",

But despite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared. We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of Galactic [CII] absorption along the IC342 sightline, although it requires disentangling [CII] emission from IC342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA study informs the prospects for [CII] absorption measurements with future facilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR telescopes -- PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins -- to detect [CII] absorption. We find that all four facilities would be able to detect [CII] absorption along a significant number of sightlines.",

Episodic progressions\nof these arcs are stored in both relational and semantic (vectorial) databases,\nenabling structured analysis and comparison. To bridge the gap between\nautomation and critical interpretation, the system is paired with a graphical\ninterface that allows for human refinement using tools to enhance and visualize\nthe data. The system performed strongly in identifying Anthology Arcs and\ncharacter entities, but its reliance on textual paratexts (such as episode\nsummaries) revealed limitations in recognizing overlapping arcs and subtler\ndynamics. This approach highlights the potential of combining computational and\nhuman expertise in narrative analysis.

However, high selectivity, specially\ntowards C2+ products, remains a critical challenge for its implementation in\ncommercial applications. Herein, we report the preparation of a series of\nelectrocatalysts based on octadecyl amine (ODA) coated Cu2O nanoparticles.\nHRTEM images show ODA coatings with thickness from 1.2 to 4 nm. DFT\ncalculations predict that at low surface coverage, ODA tends to lay on the Cu2O\nsurface, leaving hydrophilic regions. Oppositely, at high surface coverage, the\nODA molecules are densely packed, being detrimental for both mass and charge\ntransfer. These changes in ODA molecular arrangement explain differences in\nproduct selectivity. In situ Raman spectroscopy has revealed that the optimum\nODA thickness contributes to the stabilization of key intermediates in the\nformation of C2+ products, especially ethanol. Electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy and pulse voltammetry measurements confirm that the thicker ODA\nshells increase charge transfer resistance, while the lowest ODA content\npromotes faster intermediate desorption rates. At the optimum thickness, the\nintermediates desorption rates are the slowest, in agreement with the maximum\nconcentration of intermediates observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, thereby\nresulting in a Faradaic efficiency to ethanol and ethylene over 73 %.\n",

The subsequent relaxations of excited electrons in these two states occur via a two-step process (electron-phonon thermalization and recovery of the charge-ordered insulating state) and a one-step process (electron-phonon scattering), respectively. The relaxation dynamics of the electrons and the absence of acoustic phonon modes, in particular, suggest that the THz photons drive only the charge degree of freedom.

         "We present a scalable method for direct patterning of graphite and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) films on polycarbonate (PC) and other transparent substrates using fiber laser ablation. This process facilitates the fabrication of various functional devices, including strain gauges, supercapacitors, and photodetector arrays, without the need for photolithography or solvents, thereby simplifying device production and enhancing environmental sustainability. Utilizing roll-to-roll mechanical exfoliation, homogeneous nanosheet films are created and then patterned with a laser engraving system. Electrical and optical characterization confirms that the laser-processed films maintain their crystallinity, with no observable damage to the underlying substrate. We demonstrate the scalability of this approach by constructing a WSe2/graphite photodetector array on PC, which exhibits high sensitivity, low noise, and uniform photocurrent response across its active channels. As a proof-of-concept, this array is used as an image sensor to capture light patterns, showcasing its potential for flexible and semi-transparent imaging applications. These findings open up new avenues for incorporating all-van der Waals devices into wearable electronics, optoelectronics, and imaging technologies.",

Furthermore, how much anisotropy the electrical\nproperties of WP2 have and whether its electrical anisotropy can be tuned\nremain elusive. Here, we report angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy,\nelectrical transport, optical spectroscopy and first-principle studies of WP2.\nThe energies of the observed Raman-active phonons and the angle dependences of\nthe phonon intensities are well consistent with the results obtained by\nfirst-principle calculations and the analysis of the proposed crystal symmetry\nwithout spatial inversion, providing evidence that spatial inversion symmetry\nis broken in WP2. Moreover, the measured ratio (Rc/Ra) between the crystalline\nc-axis and a-axis electrical resistivities exhibits a weak dependence on\ntemperature from 100 to 250 K, but increases abruptly below 100 K, and then\nreaches the value of 8.0 at 10 K, which is by far the strongest in-plane\nelectrical resistivity anisotropy among the reported type-II WSM candidates\nwith comparable carrier concentrations. Our optical-spectroscopy and\ncalculation studies reveal that the abrupt enhancement of the Rc/Ra below 100 K\nmainly arises from a sharp increase in the scattering rate anisotropy at low\ntemperatures. More interestingly, the Rc/Ra at 10 K can be tuned from 8.0 to\n10.6 as the magnetic field increases from 0 to 9 T. The stronge and tunable\nelectrical resistivity anisotropy found in WP2 can serve as a degree of freedom\nfor tuning the electrical properties of type-II WSMs, which paves the way for\ndeveloping novel electronic applications based on type-II WSMs.\n",

Despite their\nadvantages, these lenses still face challenges in design and fabrication to\nobtain high focusing efficiency and resolving power. A nanofabrication\ntechnique is demonstrated based on photolithography and polyimide casting for\nrealizing membrane-based multilevel phase-type Fresnel zone plates (FZPs) with\nhigh focusing efficiency. By employing advantageous techniques, these lenses\nwith nanostructures are directly patterned into thin polyimide membranes. The\ncomputational and experimental results have indicated that the focusing\nefficiency of these nanostructures at the primary focus increases significantly\nwith increasing the number of phase levels. Specifically, 16-level phase lenses\non a polyimide membrane can achieve a focusing efficiency of more than 91.6% of\nthe input signal (9.5 times better than that of a conventional amplitude-type\nFZP) and focus light into a diffraction-limited spot together with very weak\nside-lobes. Furthermore, these lenses exhibit considerably reduced unwanted\ndiffraction orders and produce extremely low background signals. The potential\nimpact of these lenses extends across various applications and techniques\nincluding microscopy, imaging, micro-diffraction, remote sensing, and space\nflight instruments which require lightweight and flexible configurations.\n",

In this context, pyroelectric materials, which hold the capacity for charge generation when subjected to temperature changes, offer a promising route for this modulation. This work employs spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) to explore the impact of pyroelectricity on the electronic doping of monolayer MoS2 deposited on periodically poled LiNbO3 (LN) substrates. The results demonstrate that pyroelectricity in LN modulates the charge carrier density in MoS2 on ferroelectric surfaces acting as doping mechanism without the need for gating electrodes. Furthermore, upon cooling, pyroelectric charges effectively reverse the doping of p-n junctions on DWs, converting them into n-p junctions. These findings highlight the potential of pyroelectric substrates for tunable and configurable charge engineering in transition metal dichalcogenides and suggest their applicability to other combinations of 2D materials and ferroelectric substrates. They also open avenues for alternative device architectures in nanoelectronic or nanophotonic devices including switches, memories or sensors.",

This is achieved\nthrough a newly developed epitaxial approach comprising a series of rigorously\noptimised growth strategies. Atomic-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy\nand spectroscopy experiments reveal exceptional material quality in the active\nregion, and elucidate the impact of each growth strategy on defect dynamics.\nThe optimised III-V-on-silicon ridge-waveguide lasers demonstrate a\ncontinuous-wave threshold current as low as 6 mA and high-temperature operation\nreaching 165 {\\deg}C. At 80 {\\deg}C, critical for data centre applications,\nthey maintain a 12-mA threshold and 35 mW output power. Furthermore, lasers\nfabricated on both Si and GaAs substrates using identical processes exhibit\nvirtually identical average threshold current.

However, traditional methods like chemical vapor deposition\nand molecular beam epitaxy require highly controlled environments and\nspecialized equipment, limiting scalability and precision. To address these\nchallenges, we present a single-laser platform for selective tweezing and\nimmobilization of colloids (STIC) that integrates particle manipulation,\nassembly, and stabilization in one system. STIC utilizes a femtosecond laser at\nultra-low power for precise, contact-free optical manipulation of colloids\nwithout material damage. At higher power, the same laser enables two-photon\npolymerization (TPP) to immobilize colloids securely in their intended\npositions. Using STIC, we demonstrate the assembly of 3D structures from\ndielectric beads to patterned arrangements of transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMD e.g., MoS2). We also incorporate a TPP-fabricated handle as an\nintermediate support, significantly enhancing the optical tweezing efficiency\nof TMDs. The single-laser design eliminates the need for dual-laser systems,\nsimplifying optical alignment, reducing heating damage, and improving\nefficiency. Additionally, we show that STIC supports direct multiphoton imaging\nfor in situ inspection during fabrication.

Our findings reveal that the\nelectrical conductivity and, consequently, the power factor exhibit an\nincreasing trend with expanding ribbon length and width.

Remarkably, the Seebeck\ncoefficient at the Fermi energy corresponding to the maximum power factor\nremains nearly constant across different widths, lengths, temperatures and\ntransport regimes. Furthermore, the thermoelectric figure of merit demonstrates\na positive correlation with both ribbon length and width. In narrow widths and\nlengths around 1000 nm, the power factor and figure of merit exhibit an upward\ntrend with ribbon width. However, with further increases in ribbon width, the\ninfluence of line edge roughness on thermal conductivity diminishes.\nConsequently, the figure of merit decreases due to the rise in thermal\nconductivity.

Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.",

Here, we show that this system exhibits quasi-2D superconductivity, and utilizing the standard in-plane magneto-transport measurements, we discover two-fold anisotropy (a.k.a nematicity) in R$_{xx}$ and I$_c$ measurement, even though the system exhibits globally 12-fold symmetry. Then, we carried out similar measurements on a polycrystalline niobium (Nb) thin film, a well-known s-wave elemental superconductor, and found a similar two-fold symmetry even for this Nb system. This implies either that nematic behavior is ubiquitous or that the in-plane magneto-transport measurement scheme routinely used to detect nematicity is not a reliable method to probe nematicity. We show that the angle-dependent response of vortices in the superconducting regime to the magnetic Lorentz force is very likely the main cause behind the ubiquitous nematic behaviors of this measurement scheme. In other words, this measurement scheme is intrinsically two-fold, and is therefore not suitable to detect the nematicity. Accordingly, all the previous reports of nematicity based on similar measurement practices, reported on various samples, including thin films, bulk crystals, and exfoliated flakes, need to be reinterpreted.",

Using a continuously updating gallery, we were able to increase our\nmean Rank-1 accuracy by 24%, as material aging was taken into account step by\nstep. In addition, using models trained with 10% artificial training data,\nRank-1 accuracy could be increased by up to 13%, in comparison to a model\ntrained on only real-world data, significantly boosting generalized performance\non hold-out data. Finally, this work introduces a novel, open-source\nre-identification dataset, pallet-block-2696. This dataset contains 2,696\nimages of Euro pallets, taken over a period of 4 months. During this time,\nnatural aging processes occurred and some of the pallets were damaged during\ntheir usage. These wear and tear processes significantly changed the appearance\nof the pallets, providing a dataset that can be used to generate synthetically\naged pallets or other wooden materials.\n",

This enables us to design an algorithm to sample synthetic networks that preserves the $d$-hop neighborhood structure of a given temporal network. The higher $d$ is chosen, the better the temporal neighborhood structure of the original network is preserved. Specifically, we provide efficient algorithms that preserve time-respecting (\"causal\") paths in the networks up to length $d$, and scale to real-world network sizes. We validate our approach theoretically (for Degree and Katz centrality) and experimentally (for edge persistence, causal triangles, and burstiness). An experimental comparison shows that our method retains these key temporal characteristics more effectively than existing randomization methods.",

         "Generative models capture the true distribution of data, yielding semantically rich representations. Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) exhibit superior generative capabilities, though efficient representation learning for them are lacking. In this work, we employ a multi-level denoising autoencoder framework to expand the representation capacity of DDMs, which introduces sequentially consistent Diffusion Transformers and an additional timestep-dependent encoder to acquire embedding representations on the denoising Markov chain through self-conditional diffusion learning. Intuitively, the encoder, conditioned on the entire diffusion process, compresses high-dimensional data into directional vectors in latent under different noise levels, facilitating the learning of image embeddings across all timesteps. To verify the semantic adequacy of embeddings generated through this approach, extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, demonstrating that optimally learned embeddings by DDMs surpass state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning methods in most cases, achieving remarkable discriminative semantic representation quality. Our work justifies that DDMs are not only suitable for generative tasks, but also potentially advantageous for general-purpose deep learning applications.",

In our previous research we described methodology and a tool to generate, in automated fashion, smart contracts from BPMN models. The generated smart contracts provide support for multi-step transactions that facilitate repair/upgrade of smart contracts. In this paper we show how the approach is used to support collaborations via smart contracts for companies ranging from SMEs with little IT capabilities to companies with IT using blockchain smart contracts. Furthermore, we also show how the approach is used for certain applications to generate smart contracts by a BPMN modeler who does not need any knowledge of blockchain technology or smart contract development - thus we are hoping to facilitate democratization of smart contracts and blockchain technology.",

         "Development of blockchain smart contracts is more difficult than mainstream software development because the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. To ease the developer's task of writing smart contract, as other research efforts, we also use Business Process Model and Notation BPMN modeling to describe application requirements for trade of goods and services and then transform automatically the BPMN model into the methods of a smart contract. In our previous research we described our approach and a tool to Transform Automatically BPMN models into Smart contracts TABS. In this paper, we describe how the TABS approach is augmented with the support for a BPMN collaborative transaction by several actors. Our approach analyzes the BPMN model to determine which patterns in the BPMN model are suitable for use as collaborative transactions. The found BPMN patterns that are suitable as transactions are shown to the developer who decides which ones should be deployed as collaborative transactions. We describe how our approach automatically transform the BPMN model into smart contract the provides a transaction mechanism to enforce the transactional properties of the nested transactions. Our approach greatly reduces the developers task as synchronization of collaborative activities is provided by our approach, so that the developer needs to code only independent tasks with well-defined inputs and outputs. We also overview the TABS+ tool we built as a proof of concept to show that our approach is feasible. Finally, we provide estimates on the cost of supporting the nested BPMN collaborative transactions.",

In FL, a central parameter server coordinates the learning process by iteratively aggregating the trained models received from clients. Yet, deploying a central server is not always feasible due to hardware unavailability, infrastructure constraints, or operational costs. We present Plexus, a fully decentralized FL system for large networks that operates without the drawbacks originating from having a central server. Plexus distributes the responsibilities of model aggregation and sampling among participating nodes while avoiding network-wide coordination. We evaluate Plexus using realistic traces for compute speed, pairwise latency and network capacity. Our experiments on three common learning tasks and with up to 1000 nodes empirically show that Plexus reduces time-to-accuracy by 1.4-1.6x, communication volume by 15.8-292x and training resources needed for convergence by 30.5-77.9x compared to conventional decentralized learning algorithms.",

         "  Mixture of experts (MoE) models achieve state-of-the-art results in language\nmodeling but suffer from inefficient hardware utilization due to imbalanced\ntoken routing and communication overhead. While prior work has focused on\noptimizing MoE training and decoder architectures, inference for encoder-based\nMoE models in a multi-GPU with expert parallelism setting remains\nunderexplored. We introduce MoEShard, an inference system that achieves perfect\nload balancing through tensor sharding of MoE experts. Unlike existing\napproaches that rely on heuristic capacity factors or drop tokens, MoEShard\nevenly distributes computation across GPUs and ensures full token retention,\nmaximizing utilization regardless of routing skewness. We achieve this through\na strategic row- and column-wise decomposition of expert matrices. This reduces\nidle time and avoids bottlenecks caused by imbalanced expert assignments.\nFurthermore, MoEShard minimizes kernel launches by fusing decomposed expert\ncomputations, significantly improving throughput. We evaluate MoEShard against\nDeepSpeed on encoder-based architectures, demonstrating speedups of up to\n6.4$\\times$ in time to first token (TTFT). Our results show that tensor\nsharding, when properly applied to experts, is a viable and effective strategy\nfor efficient MoE inference.\n",

         "  This article examines the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI)\nregulation in financial services, detailing the legal frameworks and compliance\nchallenges posed by rapid technological adoption. By reviewing current\nlegislation, industry guidelines, and real-world use cases, it highlights how\nAI-driven processes, from fraud detection to algorithmic trading, offer\nefficiency gains yet introduce significant risks, including algorithmic bias,\ndata privacy breaches, and lack of transparency in automated decision-making.\nThe study compares regulatory approaches across major jurisdictions such as the\nEuropean Union, United States, and United Kingdom, identifying both universal\nconcerns, like the need for explainability and robust data protection, and\nregion-specific compliance requirements that impact the implementation of\nhigh-risk AI applications. Additionally, it underscores emerging areas of\nfocus, such as liability for AI-driven errors, systemic risks posed by\ninterlinked AI systems, and the ethical considerations of technology-driven\nfinancial exclusion. The findings reveal gaps in existing rules and emphasize\nthe necessity for adaptive, technology-neutral policies capable of fostering\ninnovation while safeguarding consumer rights and market integrity. The article\nconcludes by proposing a principled regulatory model that balances flexibility\nwith enforceable standards, advocating closer collaboration between\npolicymakers, financial institutions, and AI developers to ensure a secure,\nfair, and forward-looking framework for AI in finance.\n",

         "  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n",

The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts\nthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate\nabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).\n",
