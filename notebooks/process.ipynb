In this paper, we initiate the study of quantum locally\nrecoverable codes (qLRCs).\nIn the long term, like their classical counterparts, such qLRCs\nmay be used for large-scale quantum data storage. Furthermore, our results have concrete\nimplications for quantum LDPC codes, which are widely applicable to near-term quantum error-\ncorrection, as local recoverability is a weakening of the LDPC property.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nAfter deﬁning quantum local recoverability, we provide an explicit construction of qLRCs\nbased on the classical LRCs of Tamo and Barg (2014), which we show have (1) a close-to-optimal\nrate-distance tradeoﬀ (i.e. near the Singleton bound), (2) an eﬃcient decoder, and (3) permit\ngood spatial locality in a physical implementation. The analysis for both the distance and\nthe eﬃcient decoding of these quantum Tamo-Barg (qTB) codes is signiﬁcantly more involved\nthan in the classical case. Nevertheless, we obtain close-to-optimal parameters by introducing\na “folded” version of these qTB codes, which we then analyze using a combination of algebraic\ntechniques. We furthermore present and analyze two additional constructions using more basic\ntechniques, namely random qLRCs, and qLRCs from AEL distance ampliﬁcation. Each of these\nconstructions has some advantages, but neither achieves all 3 properties of our folded qTB codes\ndescribed above.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nWe complement these constructions with Singleton-like bounds that show our qLRC con-\nstructions achieve close-to-optimal parameters. We also apply these results to obtain Singleton-\nlike bounds for qLDPC codes, which to the best of our knowledge are novel.

Such codes are deﬁned to permit highly eﬃcient recovery from\ncommon localized errors, as well as larger-scale recovery from rarer but more “catastrophic” global\nerrors.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn this paper, we initiate the study of quantum locally recoverable codes (qLRCs). In particular,\nwe deﬁne qLRCs, present and analyze constructions, and also prove fundamental limitations on\nthe achievable parameters and properties. While our constructions can be viewed as quantum\ngeneralizations of classical constructions, the analysis becomes surprisingly intricate, and requires\nnew ideas that were not needed classically. Our results may also shed light on the study of locality\nin quantum coding theory, for instance as it pertains to quantum LDPC codes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nClassically, the properties of a LRC are well suited for the needs of large datacenters, which can\ncost billions of dollars to build and maintain, and must often account for localized server failures\nwhile also handling occasional more global failures. Indeed, companies such as Microsoft [HSX+12]\nand Facebook [MLR+14] have implemented LRCs to obtain improved performance for data storage.\nCurrently, experimental quantum computers remain at a vastly smaller scale than that of the\nclassical datacenters in which LRCs are often used in practice. However, it is not implausible that\nquantum computing technology eventually follows its classical counterpart by growing to the scale\nwhere codes such as qLRCs become an integral part of quantum data storage.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFurthermore, our study of qLRCs reveals the potential for more broad and near-term impli-\ncations as well. Indeed, locality properties in quantum codes, such as the ability to decode using\nlocal measurements (i.e. LDPC codes), are of particular importance for quantum error correction.\nYet such locality is notoriously diﬃcult to achieve in the quantum setting. Indeed, the ﬁrst linear-\ndistance quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes were only recently constructed [PK22, LZ22, DHLV23],\nand good quantum codes with stronger properties such as local testability have yet to be con-\nstructed. This diﬃculty of achieving locality is in contrast to the classical setting, where good\nLDPC codes have been known for decades (e.g. [SS96]), good locally testable codes were recently\nconstructed [PK22, DEL+22], and other strong locality properties such as local correctability exist\nin linear-distance, albeit low-rate codes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFrom this perspective, our study of qLRCs provides a new angle to investigate locality properties\nin quantum codes. Indeed, classical local recoverability requires each code component to participate\nin one low-weight parity check, while quantum local recoverability requires each code component\nto participate in two low-weight stabilizers. Thus local recoverability can be viewed as a weaking\nof the LDPC property, in which each code component participates in many low-weight parity\nchecks/stabilizers. Our study of qLRCs can therefore be viewed as progress towards understanding\nstronger locality properties possessed by qLDPC codes. One concrete example of this connection\nis provided in Section 3, where we show that qLRCs, and therefore also qLDPC codes, of constant\nlocality r = O(1) must have relative distance bounded away from 1/2; to the best of our knowledge\nsuch a bound for qLDPC codes had not been previously shown.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn this section we present the contributions of our paper.

Recall that a classical LRC (cLRC) is a classical code C such that for\nC and every component i, the value of ci can be recovered by looking at the restriction\nevery c\nof c to just r\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\n1 other components.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDeﬁnition 1 (Informal statement of Deﬁnition 32). A quantum locally recoverable code\n(qLRC) of locality r is a quantum code\nC\nis erased (i.e. it experiences a completely depolarizing channel), the original code state\nrecovered by applying a recovery channel that accesses only r\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nψ\nsuch that if any single qudit of a code state\ni ∈ C\n|\ncan be\nψ\ni\n1 other code state qudits.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor intuition, recall that a classical linear code is a cLRC of locality r if each component takes\npart in a parity-check of weight\n= CSS(CX , CZ )\nis a qLRC if both CX, CZ are cLRCs, so that every qudit takes part in a low weight X-parity-check\nand a low-weight Z-parity-check (see Corollary 34).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.4**r== 0.2**\nr. Similarly, we show that a quantum CSS code\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe remark that classically, there is also a notion of message locally recoverable codes (mLRCs),\nwhich require that every message (instead of codeword) symbol can be recovered from r\n1 code-\nword symbols. As any linear classical code has a systematic encoding, meaning that the ﬁrst k\ncodeword symbols equal the message, classical mLRCs are strictly weaker than LRCs. However,\nthe local indistinguishability property of quantum codes (see Lemma 26) implies that local queries\nto quantum codes cannot reveal anything about the message. Thus mLRCs do not exist quantumly,\nat least in the regime where the locality is less than the distance.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n1.1.2 Explicit Construction of qLRCs\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOne of our principal technical contributions is the following explicit construction of qLRCs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTheorem 2 (Folded quantum Tamo-Barg codes; informal statement of Corollary 64 combined\nwith Lemma 56). For every prime number r and every 0 < R < 1, there exists an inﬁnite explicit\nfamily of qLRCs of locality r, rate\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nR, relative distance\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nand alphabet size nO(r2), where n denotes the block length.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn Theorem 2 (and in future informal result statements in Section 1), for readability we state\nslightly looser bounds than the formal result statements. For instance, our actual distance bound\nin Corollary 64 is stronger than than stated in Theorem 2 for high rates, and in particular shows\nthat δ\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nΩ(1/r) for all R\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe remark that while the alphabet size nO(r2) may seem large, in the LRC literature one\ntypically thinks of each code component as being a fairly large entity, so such a polynomial alphabet\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsize is not unreasonable. Classically each code component could for instance be a hard drive, while\nquantumly each component would likely be itself a fault-tolerant quantum memeory.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe prove Theorem 2 by introducing a quantum CSS version of the classical LRCs of Tamo and\nBarg [TB14], which achieve the optimal classical rate-distance-locality tradeoﬀ [GHSY12]. The\nclassical Tamo-Barg (TB) codes are constructed as subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes by carefully\ninserting low-weight parity checks.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nMultiple complications arise when converting TB codes into CSS codes. Speciﬁcally, to ensure\nthe CSS orthogonality relations are satisﬁed, we deﬁne a quantum Tamo-Barg (qTB) code to be a\nCSS code\n= CSS(C, C) consisting of two copies of a classical code C that contains a TB code as a\nsubcode, but also contains some added low-weight codewords. These added low-weight codewords\nalso lie in C ⊥, so they do not necessarily degrade the distance of\n, which equals the minimum\nC ⊥. However, these added low-weight codewords make the distance\nweight of an element of C\nanalysis signiﬁcantly more challenging, and we are only able to show a “Johnson-like” bound on\nthe distance of qTB codes:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTheorem 3 (Quantum Tamo-Barg codes; informal statement of Theorem 62).

We then use a combination\nof algebraic techniques to bound the distance of these folded qTB (fqTB) codes; the two main tools\nare a root detection method involving a determinant polynomial, and an uncertainty principle over\nﬁnite ﬁelds.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn Section 1.2 below, we describe the formal construction of our (f)qTB codes, and outline the\nproofs of Theorem 3 and Theorem 2.

We show that applying AEL using a random qLRC as an “inner code,”\nwhich is small enough to be found eﬃciently via brute force, yields the following result.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nProposition 6 (qLRCs from AEL; informal statement of Proposition 49). For every ﬁxed 0 <\nN that there exists an inﬁnite family of eﬃciently\nR < 1, it holds for all suﬃciently large r\nconstructable qLRCs of locality r, rate R, relative distance\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nand alphabet size q = 2O(r), where the OR above hides a constant depending on R.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAs described in Remark 50, the codes in Proposition 6 are technically only eﬃciently con-\nstructable by a randomized algorithm with high probability, but can be made truly explicit by\nusing a slightly more complicated construction, with slightly worse parameters. Also, like our fqTB\ncodes, we show that these codes from AEL have eﬃcient decoders from errors in unknown locations.\nThe alphabet size q = 2O(r) in Proposition 6 is smaller than the q = nO(r2) of our fqTB codes in\nTheorem 2. However, qLRCs from AEL have worse rate-distance-locality tradeoﬀ, as their relative\ndistance is OR(1/r1/4) below the Singleton-like bound, compared to only O(1/√r) for our fqTB\ncodes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOur (f)qTB codes may have additional practical advantages over the qLRCs from AEL. For\ninstance, our (f)qTB codes can achieve locality as small as r = 3, whereas the the minimum pos-\nsible locality in the qLRCs from AEL is r = 9. Furthermore, as one step in the AEL construction\nredistributes code symbols according to the edges of an expander graph, the resulting size-r sets of\ncode components used for local recovery form an r-uniform hypergraph with a complex expanding\nstructure. In contrast, the recovery sets of our (f)qTB codes form a partition of the code com-\nponents, which is ideally suited for a physical implementation with good spatial locality. That is,\nour (f)qTB codes can easily be implemented in 1, 2, or 3-dimensional space such that each local\nrecovery operation only involves code components that are close together; such a spatially local\nimplementation would be much less feasible for a qLRC from AEL.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n1.1.5 Eﬃcient Decoding Algorithms\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis section presents our results on the decodability of our qLRCs. As we discussed previously, in\nthe classical setting, LRCs are typically used for data storage where errors correspond to events\nsuch as server failures that are detectable. Such errors occur in known locations, so they can be\ntreated as erasures. Because every linear code can be eﬃciently decoded from a number of erasures\nup to the distance using Gaussian elimination, the eﬃciency of decoding is often not a primary\nconcern for cLRCs. Note that all of our qLRC constructions are stabilizer (and in fact CSS) codes,\nwhich can similarly be decoded eﬃciently from erasures.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHowever, in the quantum setting there are additional potential applications of eﬃcient decoding\nfrom errors in unknown locations. Due to the inherently noisy nature of quantum states, even if\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\na qLRC is used to store a large quantum state where each code component is itself stored in a\nfault-tolerant memory, these individual fault-tolerant memories may eventually accumulate errors.\nAs such, it may be beneﬁcial to occasionally perform a global decoding procedure to reduce the\noverall error rate in the long term.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFurthermore, as we have previously discussed, qLRCs can be viewed as a stepping stone towards\nbetter understanding stronger locality properties, such as the LDPC property, which are important\nfor near-term quantum error correction. As eﬃcient decoding is critical for these error correction\napplications, it is desirable that the qLRCs we study are also eﬃciently decodable.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBelow we present a polynomial-time decoding algorithm for the fqTB codes in Theorem 2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTheorem 7 (Decoding fqTB codes; informal statement of Corollary 72). The fqTB codes in The-\norem 2 of block length n, prime locality parameter r, and rate R can be decoded from errors acting\non an unknown\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfraction of the code components in time nOr(1), provided the alphabet size is increased to some\nsuﬃciently large q = nOr(1) with respect to r.

While the algorithm runs in polynomial time nOr(1) for ﬁxed locality parameter r, this\nalgorithm is ineﬃcient for growing r. We address this issue by providing the following decoding\nalgorithm for unfolded qTB codes, which therefore also applies to folded qTB codes, and whose\nrunning time is a polynomial independent of r.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTheorem 8 (Decoding (f)qTB codes; informal statement of Theorem 69). An (unfolded or folded)\nqTB code of block length n, prime locality parameter r, and rate R can be decoded from errors acting\non an unknown\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n− r\nfraction of the code components in time nO(1).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe decoder in Theorem 8 simply performs r\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n1 calls to a classical Reed-Solomon (list) decoder,\n−\nand then performs some postprocessing on the resulting outputs (see Algorithm 1).

Therefore this\ndecoding radius is optimal among decoders for qTB codes, barring an improvement to our distance\nbound in Theorem 3.

The decoding task for\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe prove both Theorem 8 and Theorem 7 using similar techniques as in the proof of Theorem 3.\nSpeciﬁcally, let\ncan be reduced to\nthe following problem: given a corrupted codeword a of C, we want an eﬃcient algorithm the\nrecovers some c\nC that is close to a in Hamming weight. For this purpose, we show how every\nC can be modiﬁed to obtain some c′ that is a codeword of a Reed-Solomon code. Applying\nc\nthe same modiﬁcation to a, we obtain a corrupted Reed-Solomon codeword a′. We then apply a\nReed-Solomon (list) decoder to recover c′, which we can then map back to the desired codeword c.\nTo decode fqTB codes in Theorem 7, we use the same algorithm, except now we apply a folded\nReed-Solomon list decoder [GR08] to recover c′ from a′. As folded Reed-Solomon codes have a\nlarger list-decoding radius than ordinary Reed-Solomon codes, and our fqTB distance bound in\nTheorem 2 is better than our qTB distance bound in Theorem 3, we obtain a larger decoding\nradius in Theorem 7 than in Theorem 8.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.3**\nImpossibility of Quantum Locally Correctable Codes\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOur results on qLRCs described above indicate that while optimal local recoverability is more\nnuanced and diﬃcult to achieve quantumly than classically, there do exist constructions of qLRCs\napproaching the optimal parameters.\nIt is therefore natural to consider quantum analogues of\nstronger forms of locality that exist classically.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLocal correctability and local decodability provide particularly notable examples of such prop-\nerties. Recall that an LRC of block length n and locality r has the property that any single code\n[n] is erased, the value of a codeword at that component can be recovered from\ncomponent i\n1 unerased components. A locally correctable code (LCC) has the stronger property that\n≤\nafter a linear number Ω(n) of code components are erased, the value of a codeword at each erased\ncomponent i can be recovered from\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n1 unerased components.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n−\nEquivalently, an LRC requires the value of a codeword at each component i\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nerable from some recovery set of\ncomponent i\nthat can be used to recover the codeword’s value at i.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.3**\n[n] to have Ω(n) disjoint recovery sets, each of which contains\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.1**\n[n] to be recov-\n1 other components.

Recall\nthat LCCs are typically required to have linearly many such disjoint recovery sets for each code\ncomponent. Thus qLRCs, which have a single recovery set for each qudit, are in some sense the\nlimit of what is possible for quantum local correctability.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nTheorem 9 (Impossibility of quantum LCCs; informal statement of Theorem 74).

We address this issue by introducing a “folded” version of qTB codes,\nfor which we show the distance does approach the Singleton bound for large localities r. The proof\nof this distance bound for folded qTB codes (Theorem 2) is quite involved, so in this section we\nsimply provide a brief description of the main ideas involved.

Thus to prove Theorem 2, we simply need to bound the distance of the fqTB\ncode. For this purpose, deﬁne S as in (1), so that the underlying unfolded qTB code\n= CSS(C, C)\nhas C = ev(Fq[X]S ). The distance of ˜\nby deﬁnition equals the minimum over all codewords\nC\n(see Deﬁnition 14) in\nev(f )\nwhich f takes at least one nonzero value.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 13.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.5**\nC ⊥ of the number of distinct blocks\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAt a high level, we bound this minimum distance by considering two types of message poly-\nFq[X]S separately. For the ﬁrst type of message polynomial, we\nnomials f (X) =\nuse a similar argument as described in the proof sketch of Theorem 13 in Section 1.2.2. We are\nable to leverage the folding to replace the polynomial G(X) in (3) with another polynomial, which\nconsists of the composition of f with a determinant polynomial. This alternative choice of G(X)\ndetects roots of f more eﬃciently relative to its degree, and hence yields a better distance bound\n(see Claim 68). However, this method breaks down when the coeﬃcients fi of f are supported in\na small number of distinct values i (mod r), that is, when there are\nr distinct values i (mod r)\n= 0. The reason for the breakdown on these “bad” polynomials f stems from\namong all i with fi 6\nthe fact that we need G(X) to be a nonzero polynomial, which becomes more diﬃcult when f has\nfewer nonzero coeﬃcients.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFortunately, we can consider such “bad” message polynomials f separately, and instead apply an\nuncertainty principle (Proposition 66) to bound the weight of the associated codeword (Claim 67).\nIntuitively, this uncertainty principle implies that if the coeﬃcients fi are zero for most values of i\n(mod r), then most of the evaluation points in ev(f ) must be nonzero, so ev(f ) has large weight.\nCombining our bounds from the two types of message polynomials described above, we obtain\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\na bound on the distance of the fqTB code\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n, which yields Theorem 2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n1.3 Open Questions\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOur work leads the the following open questions:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n• Can explicit qLRCs be constructed with a better rate-distance-locality tradeoﬀ than given\nby Theorem 2?

Such codes are deﬁned to permit highly eﬃcient recovery from common localized errors, as well as larger-scale recovery from rarer but more “catastrophic” global errors.   In this paper, we initiate the study of quantum locally recoverable codes (qLRCs). In particular, we deﬁne qLRCs, present and analyze constructions, and also prove fundamental limitations on the achievable parameters and properties. While our constructions can be viewed as quantum generalizations of classical constructions, the analysis becomes surprisingly intricate, and requires new ideas that were not needed classically. Our results may also shed light on the study of locality in quantum coding theory, for instance as it pertains to quantum LDPC codes.   Classically, the properties of a LRC are well suited for the needs of large datacenters, which can cost billions of dollars to build and maintain, and must often account for localized server failures while also handling occasional more global failures. Indeed, companies such as Microsoft [HSX+12] and Facebook [MLR+14] have implemented LRCs to obtain improved performance for data storage. Currently, experimental quantum computers remain at a vastly smaller scale than that of the classical datacenters in which LRCs are often used in practice. However, it is not implausible that quantum computing technology eventually follows its classical counterpart by growing to the scale where codes such as qLRCs become an integral part of quantum data storage.   Furthermore, our study of qLRCs reveals the potential for more broad and near-term impli- cations as well. Indeed, locality properties in quantum codes, such as the ability to decode using local measurements (i.e. LDPC codes), are of particular importance for quantum error correction. Yet such locality is notoriously diﬃcult to achieve in the quantum setting. Indeed, the ﬁrst linear- distance quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes were only recently constructed [PK22, LZ22, DHLV23], and good quantum codes with stronger properties such as local testability have yet to be con- structed. This diﬃculty of achieving locality is in contrast to the classical setting, where good LDPC codes have been known for decades (e.g. [SS96]), good locally testable codes were recently constructed [PK22, DEL+22], and other strong locality properties such as local correctability exist in linear-distance, albeit low-rate codes.   From this perspective, our study of qLRCs provides a new angle to investigate locality properties in quantum codes. Indeed, classical local recoverability requires each code component to participate in one low-weight parity check, while quantum local recoverability requires each code component to participate in two low-weight stabilizers. Thus local recoverability can be viewed as a weaking of the LDPC property, in which each code component participates in many low-weight parity checks/stabilizers. Our study of qLRCs can therefore be viewed as progress towards understanding stronger locality properties possessed by qLDPC codes. One concrete example of this connection is provided in Section 3, where we show that qLRCs, and therefore also qLDPC codes, of constant locality r = O(1) must have relative distance bounded away from 1/2; to the best of our knowledge such a bound for qLDPC codes had not been previously shown.   In this section we present the contributions of our paper. For details on notation or basic deﬁnitions, the reader is referred to Section 2.   1.1.1 Deﬁnition of Quantum Local Recoverability   To begin, we deﬁne qLRCs. Recall that a classical LRC (cLRC) is a classical code C such that for C and every component i, the value of ci can be recovered by looking at the restriction every c of c to just r   1 other components.   Deﬁnition 1 (Informal statement of Deﬁnition 32). A quantum locally recoverable code (qLRC) of locality r is a quantum code C is erased (i.e. it experiences a completely depolarizing channel), the original code state recovered by applying a recovery channel that accesses only r   ψ such that if any single qudit of a code state i ∈ C | can be ψ i 1 other code state qudits.   For intuition, recall that a classical linear code is a cLRC of locality r if each component takes part in a parity-check of weight = CSS(CX , CZ ) is a qLRC if both CX, CZ are cLRCs, so that every qudit takes part in a low weight X-parity-check and a low-weight Z-parity-check (see Corollary 34).   r. Similarly, we show that a quantum CSS code   We remark that classically, there is also a notion of message locally recoverable codes (mLRCs), which require that every message (instead of codeword) symbol can be recovered from r 1 code- word symbols. As any linear classical code has a systematic encoding, meaning that the ﬁrst k codeword symbols equal the message, classical mLRCs are strictly weaker than LRCs. However, the local indistinguishability property of quantum codes (see Lemma 26) implies that local queries to quantum codes cannot reveal anything about the message. Thus mLRCs do not exist quantumly, at least in the regime where the locality is less than the distance.   1.1.2 Explicit Construction of qLRCs   One of our principal technical contributions is the following explicit construction of qLRCs.   Theorem 2 (Folded quantum Tamo-Barg codes; informal statement of Corollary 64 combined with Lemma 56). For every prime number r and every 0 < R < 1, there exists an inﬁnite explicit family of qLRCs of locality r, rate   R, relative distance   and alphabet size nO(r2), where n denotes the block length.   In Theorem 2 (and in future informal result statements in Section 1), for readability we state slightly looser bounds than the formal result statements. For instance, our actual distance bound in Corollary 64 is stronger than than stated in Theorem 2 for high rates, and in particular shows that δ   Ω(1/r) for all R   We remark that while the alphabet size nO(r2) may seem large, in the LRC literature one typically thinks of each code component as being a fairly large entity, so such a polynomial alphabet   size is not unreasonable. Classically each code component could for instance be a hard drive, while quantumly each component would likely be itself a fault-tolerant quantum memeory.   We prove Theorem 2 by introducing a quantum CSS version of the classical LRCs of Tamo and Barg [TB14], which achieve the optimal classical rate-distance-locality tradeoﬀ [GHSY12]. The classical Tamo-Barg (TB) codes are constructed as subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes by carefully inserting low-weight parity checks.   Multiple complications arise when converting TB codes into CSS codes. Speciﬁcally, to ensure the CSS orthogonality relations are satisﬁed, we deﬁne a quantum Tamo-Barg (qTB) code to be a CSS code = CSS(C, C) consisting of two copies of a classical code C that contains a TB code as a subcode, but also contains some added low-weight codewords. These added low-weight codewords also lie in C ⊥, so they do not necessarily degrade the distance of , which equals the minimum C ⊥. However, these added low-weight codewords make the distance weight of an element of C analysis signiﬁcantly more challenging, and we are only able to show a “Johnson-like” bound on the distance of qTB codes:   Theorem 3 (Quantum Tamo-Barg codes; informal statement of Theorem 62). For every prime number r and every 0 < R < 1, there exists an inﬁnite explicit family of qLRCs of locality r, rate   R, relative distance    and alphabet size n + 1, where n denotes the block length.   To obtain the improved bound δ   O(1/√r) in Theorem 2, we “fold” together code components, thereby reblocking the symbols into larger components. We then use a combination of algebraic techniques to bound the distance of these folded qTB (fqTB) codes; the two main tools are a root detection method involving a determinant polynomial, and an uncertainty principle over ﬁnite ﬁelds.   In Section 1.2 below, we describe the formal construction of our (f)qTB codes, and outline the proofs of Theorem 3 and Theorem 2. A more detailed description of these codes is provided in Section 5, and the distance bounds are formally proven in Section 6.   1.1.3 Singleton-Like Bound for qLRCs, with Implications for qLDCP Codes   Our fqTB codes in Theorem 2 achieve an optimal rate-distance tradeoﬀ as the locality r grows large. In particular, we prove the following fundamental limitation on any qLRC.   Theorem 4 (Singleton-like bound; informal statement of Theorem 35). If r and rate R, then   has relative distance   is a qLRC of locality   The reader is referred to Theorem 35 for the speciﬁc value of the constant hidden in the the   Ω(1/r) term above.   For comparison, recall that the ordinary quantum Singleton bound states that every quantum R)/2+O(1/n), where n denotes the block length. Thus   code of rate R has relative distance δ   for a ﬁxed rate, Theorem 4 shows that imposing local recoverability with locality r decreases the optimal relative distance of a quantum code by at least Ω(1/r). Meanwhile, our explicit construction in Theorem 64 has relative distance O(1/√r) below that of the Singleton bound.   R + O(1/n), while for cLRCs of locality r this bound becomes δ   Theorem 4 implies a fundamental diﬀerence between the classical and quantum cases for LRCs of low rate. Classically, the ordinary Singleton bound says that a code of rate R has relative distance δ 1) + O(1/n). The TB codes achieve this latter bound, proving its tightness. Therefore in particular, for ﬁxed 0, we see that there exist classical LRCs of relative distance locality r, by letting the rate R In contrast, whereas there exist quantum codes of relative distance approaching 1/2, δ Theorem 4 shows every qLRC has relative distance at most 1/2 Ω(1/r), which is bounded away from 1/2 for ﬁxed r.   As we mentioned previously, because every (q)LRC is a by deﬁnition a (q)LDPC code, it follows that qLDPC codes of locality r have relative distance Ω(1/r) for arbitrarily large alphabets. To the best of our knowledge, such a bound has not been previously shown in the literature. This result is in again in contrast to the classical case, where for instance the q-ary Hadamard code is an LDPC code of locality 3 with relative distance approaching 1 as q grows large.   The discussion above raises the interesting question as to how tight Theorem 4 is for qLDPC codes. That is, what is the additional cost to the optimal rate-distance tradeoﬀ of requiring a quantum code be LDPC, compared to just being an LRC?   1.1.4 Comparison to Basic Constructions   While our explicit fqTB codes in Theorem 2 are O(1/√r) below the Singleton-like bound in The- orem 4, we show that a randomized construction improves this gap to O(1/r), at the cost of explicitness and eﬃciency.   Proposition 5 (Random qLRCs; informal statement of Proposition 40). For every r 3 and δ > 0, there exists a randomized construction that with high probability gives a qLRC of locality r, rate R, relative distance   and alphabet size 2O(r).   The constant hidden in the O(1/r) term in Proposition 5 is larger than the constant in the Ω(1/r) term in Theorem 4, so our bound on the randomized construction is still O(1/r) below that of our Singleton-like bound.   Thus the randomized construction in Proposition 40 achieves relative distance O(1/r) below our Singleton-like bound with has alphabet size 2O(r). These parameters improve upon our fqTB construction, which has relative distance O(1/√r) below the Singleton-like bound, and has alphabet size nO(r2).   However, the main disadvantage of the randomized construction is its non-explicitness. As a result, we have no eﬃcient algorithm to certify that a randomly sampled qLRC has good distance, and we have no eﬃcient decoding algorithm for errors in unknown locations. In contrast, our fqTB codes are explicit, so their distance bound is guaranteed. Furthermore, we show that they have an eﬃcient decoding algorithm (see Section 1.1.5 below).   One way of derandomizing the random qLRCs in Proposition 5 is to use them as in inner code in the concatenation and distance ampliﬁcation scheme of Alon, Edmunds, and Luby (AEL) [AEL95]. This technique has been used extensively in classical coding theory [GI01, GI02, GI03, GR08, HW18, KMRZS16, GKO+18, HRZW20], but has only recently been considered in the quantum setting [BGG22, WLH23]. We show that applying AEL using a random qLRC as an “inner code,” which is small enough to be found eﬃciently via brute force, yields the following result.   Proposition 6 (qLRCs from AEL; informal statement of Proposition 49). For every ﬁxed 0 < N that there exists an inﬁnite family of eﬃciently R < 1, it holds for all suﬃciently large r constructable qLRCs of locality r, rate R, relative distance   and alphabet size q = 2O(r), where the OR above hides a constant depending on R.   As described in Remark 50, the codes in Proposition 6 are technically only eﬃciently con- structable by a randomized algorithm with high probability, but can be made truly explicit by using a slightly more complicated construction, with slightly worse parameters. Also, like our fqTB codes, we show that these codes from AEL have eﬃcient decoders from errors in unknown locations. The alphabet size q = 2O(r) in Proposition 6 is smaller than the q = nO(r2) of our fqTB codes in Theorem 2. However, qLRCs from AEL have worse rate-distance-locality tradeoﬀ, as their relative distance is OR(1/r1/4) below the Singleton-like bound, compared to only O(1/√r) for our fqTB codes.   Our (f)qTB codes may have additional practical advantages over the qLRCs from AEL. For instance, our (f)qTB codes can achieve locality as small as r = 3, whereas the the minimum pos- sible locality in the qLRCs from AEL is r = 9. Furthermore, as one step in the AEL construction redistributes code symbols according to the edges of an expander graph, the resulting size-r sets of code components used for local recovery form an r-uniform hypergraph with a complex expanding structure. In contrast, the recovery sets of our (f)qTB codes form a partition of the code com- ponents, which is ideally suited for a physical implementation with good spatial locality. That is, our (f)qTB codes can easily be implemented in 1, 2, or 3-dimensional space such that each local recovery operation only involves code components that are close together; such a spatially local implementation would be much less feasible for a qLRC from AEL.   This section presents our results on the decodability of our qLRCs. As we discussed previously, in the classical setting, LRCs are typically used for data storage where errors correspond to events such as server failures that are detectable. Such errors occur in known locations, so they can be treated as erasures. Because every linear code can be eﬃciently decoded from a number of erasures up to the distance using Gaussian elimination, the eﬃciency of decoding is often not a primary concern for cLRCs. Note that all of our qLRC constructions are stabilizer (and in fact CSS) codes, which can similarly be decoded eﬃciently from erasures.   However, in the quantum setting there are additional potential applications of eﬃcient decoding from errors in unknown locations. Due to the inherently noisy nature of quantum states, even if   a qLRC is used to store a large quantum state where each code component is itself stored in a fault-tolerant memory, these individual fault-tolerant memories may eventually accumulate errors. As such, it may be beneﬁcial to occasionally perform a global decoding procedure to reduce the overall error rate in the long term.   Furthermore, as we have previously discussed, qLRCs can be viewed as a stepping stone towards better understanding stronger locality properties, such as the LDPC property, which are important for near-term quantum error correction. As eﬃcient decoding is critical for these error correction applications, it is desirable that the qLRCs we study are also eﬃciently decodable.   Below we present a polynomial-time decoding algorithm for the fqTB codes in Theorem 2.   Theorem 7 (Decoding fqTB codes; informal statement of Corollary 72). The fqTB codes in The- orem 2 of block length n, prime locality parameter r, and rate R can be decoded from errors acting on an unknown   fraction of the code components in time nOr(1), provided the alphabet size is increased to some suﬃciently large q = nOr(1) with respect to r. Here Or(1) denotes a suﬃciently large constant depending only on r.   Theorem 7 provides a decoding algorithm for the fqTB codes with decoding radius up to half our distance bound in Theorem 2, which is therefore optimal barring an improvement in the distance bound. While the algorithm runs in polynomial time nOr(1) for ﬁxed locality parameter r, this algorithm is ineﬃcient for growing r. We address this issue by providing the following decoding algorithm for unfolded qTB codes, which therefore also applies to folded qTB codes, and whose running time is a polynomial independent of r.   Theorem 8 (Decoding (f)qTB codes; informal statement of Theorem 69). An (unfolded or folded) qTB code of block length n, prime locality parameter r, and rate R can be decoded from errors acting on an unknown   − r fraction of the code components in time nO(1).   The decoder in Theorem 8 simply performs r   1 calls to a classical Reed-Solomon (list) decoder, − and then performs some postprocessing on the resulting outputs (see Algorithm 1). Therefore this algorithm should be eﬃcient in practice, as Reed-Solomon decoders have been optimized for practical use.   The decoding radius in Theorem 8 is half our distance bound in Theorem 3. Therefore this decoding radius is optimal among decoders for qTB codes, barring an improvement to our distance bound in Theorem 3. As   the unfolded qTB codes achieve distance and decoding radius within roughly a factor of 2 of the optimal values as dictated by our Singleton-like bound in Theorem 4.   = CSS(C, C) denote the qTB code. The decoding task for   We prove both Theorem 8 and Theorem 7 using similar techniques as in the proof of Theorem 3. Speciﬁcally, let can be reduced to the following problem: given a corrupted codeword a of C, we want an eﬃcient algorithm the recovers some c C that is close to a in Hamming weight. For this purpose, we show how every C can be modiﬁed to obtain some c′ that is a codeword of a Reed-Solomon code. Applying c the same modiﬁcation to a, we obtain a corrupted Reed-Solomon codeword a′. We then apply a Reed-Solomon (list) decoder to recover c′, which we can then map back to the desired codeword c. To decode fqTB codes in Theorem 7, we use the same algorithm, except now we apply a folded Reed-Solomon list decoder [GR08] to recover c′ from a′. As folded Reed-Solomon codes have a larger list-decoding radius than ordinary Reed-Solomon codes, and our fqTB distance bound in Theorem 2 is better than our qTB distance bound in Theorem 3, we obtain a larger decoding radius in Theorem 7 than in Theorem 8.   Impossibility of Quantum Locally Correctable Codes   Our results on qLRCs described above indicate that while optimal local recoverability is more nuanced and diﬃcult to achieve quantumly than classically, there do exist constructions of qLRCs approaching the optimal parameters. It is therefore natural to consider quantum analogues of stronger forms of locality that exist classically.   Local correctability and local decodability provide particularly notable examples of such prop- erties. Recall that an LRC of block length n and locality r has the property that any single code [n] is erased, the value of a codeword at that component can be recovered from component i 1 unerased components. A locally correctable code (LCC) has the stronger property that ≤ after a linear number Ω(n) of code components are erased, the value of a codeword at each erased component i can be recovered from   1 unerased components.   − Equivalently, an LRC requires the value of a codeword at each component i   erable from some recovery set of component i that can be used to recover the codeword’s value at i.   [n] to have Ω(n) disjoint recovery sets, each of which contains   [n] to be recov- 1 other components. In contrast, an LCC requires each 1 components   Local decodable codes (LDCs) are deﬁned similarly, except they only need to support local   The Hadamard and Reed-Muller codes provide examples of classical LCCs and LDCs.   therefore natural to ask whether there are quantum versions of these types of codes.   As local access to a quantum code of large distance cannot reveal any information about the message, local decodability seems to make little sense quantumly, at least in the regime of large distance and small locality. However, quantum local correctability may seem to be a reasonable strengthening of quantum local recoverability.   We show below that quantum local correctability is impossible in a strong sense: if a quantum code has even two disjoint recovery sets for a single qudit, then that qudit is unentangled with the remainder of the code state, and contains no information about the message state. Recall that LCCs are typically required to have linearly many such disjoint recovery sets for each code component. Thus qLRCs, which have a single recovery set for each qudit, are in some sense the limit of what is possible for quantum local correctability.   Theorem 9 (Impossibility of quantum LCCs; informal statement of Theorem 74). Let   While we prove Theorem 9 for general quantum codes   [n] quantum code of block length n such that for some qudit i ∈ satisfying I 1 such that the following holds for each b = 1, 2: if qudit i of a code state is erased (i.e. it experiences a completely depolarizing channel), the original code state ψ ψ can be recovered by applying a recovery channel that only accesses qudits in I b i . Then there exists a . 1-qudit state α such that every ψ   can be decomposed as ψ = αi ⊗ (Cd)⊗ n, it is illustrative to consider i = CSS(CX, CZ ), a set Ii ∋ CSS or stabilizer codes. Recall from Section 1.1.1 that for a CSS code can be used to recover qudit i if both CX and CZ have parity checks whose support contains i and I 2 lies inside Ii. Thus if I 1 , then there i i = i ∩ } { I 2 i . But supp(c′Z ) are parity checks c′X ∈ ∈ = 0, which contradicts the orthogonality c′Z = (c′X )i(c′Z )i 6 then supp(c′X ) ∩ to be a well deﬁned CSS code. Thus Theorem 9 holds for CSS condition C ⊥X ⊆ codes. A similar proof holds for stabilizer codes; In Theorem 74 we prove the more general result for arbitrary quantum codes.   i , I 2 C ⊥X and c′Z ∈ , so c′X · i supp(c′Z ) = } { CZ required for C   i are both recovery sets for component i with I 1 I 1 i and i   C ⊥Z such that i   supp(c′X )   1.2 Overview of (Folded) Quantum Tamo-Barg codes   In this section, we provide more details on our (folded) quantum Tamo-Barg codes described in Section 1.1.2, and we overview the techniques we use to prove the distance bounds in Theorem 2 and Theorem 3. The construction and analysis of these codes comprise one of the main technical contributions of our paper.   1.2.1 Background and Classical Tamo-Barg Codes   Our qTB codes are CSS codes whose associated classical codes are polynomial evaluation codes that are closely related to the classical LRCs of Tamo and Barg [TB14]. To describe these codes, we use the following notation. For a subset S denote the space of polynomials for which only monomials X i for i S can have nonzero coeﬃcients. q ∼= Fq Then let ev : Fq[X]S denote the evaluation map on nonzero points in Fq, so that ev(f ) = (f (x))x   S aiX i : a ∈   0, let Fq[X]S =   With this notation, a classical Tamo-Barg (TB) code [TB14] speciﬁed by a prime power q, a   locality parameter r   1), and an integer ℓ   [q] is given by ev(Fq[X]S ) for   [TB14] showed that this code has alphabet size q, block length q   ℓ, and is locally recoverable with locality r.   1, dimension ℓ   , distance ⌋   1.2.2 Quantum Tamo-Barg codes   In this section, we deﬁne our quantum analogue of TB codes, and give an overview of the analysis. For more details, the reader is referred to Section 5.2 and Section 6.1.   As described in Section 1.1.2, to deﬁne a qTB code, we must ﬁrst modify the classical TB code by adding some low-weight codewords in order to construct a well-deﬁned associated quantum   CSS code. These added low-weight codewords can be interpreted as piecewise linear functions, as described below.   Deﬁnition 10 (Quantum Tamo-Barg codes; restatement of Deﬁnition 53). For a prime power q, a [q], we deﬁne the quantum Tamo-Barg 1) with r locality parameter r (qTB) code to be the CSS code   3, and an integer ℓ ∈ = CSS(C, C) with C = ev(Fq[X]S ) for   . 1 (mod r) } By some basic algebraic manipulations (see Lemma 55), we show that C ⊥ ⊆ C   C, so the qTB has 1. A straightforward calculation (see Lemma 56) shows that   = CSS(C, C) is indeed a well-deﬁned quantum CSS code. Note that by construction   code alphabet size q and block length q   has dimension   for some ǫ   The code C in the deﬁnition above is by deﬁnition the sum of a classical TB code ev(Fq[X][ℓ]   (1+rZ)). We call this latter code P the space of piecewise linear ∩   with the code1 P := ev(Fq[X][q functions due to the following lemma.   Lemma 11 (Restatement of Lemma 57). Let Ωr = Then P = ev(Fq[X][q form f (x) = βxΩr ·   x for some β   F∗q : xr = 1 denote the rth roots of unity. } (1+rZ)) consists of all functions f : F∗q → Fq that can be expressed in the   Lemma 11 follows directly from the fact that the evaluation of a polynomial h(X) on inputs in xr) on such inputs. The lemma implies that every   xΩr equals the evaluation of h(X) (mod X r function in P equals a linear function on the restriction to inputs in each coset xΩr.   We show in Lemma 55 that P   C ⊥, from which we obtain the local recoverability of   Corollary 12 (Restatement of Corollary 58). The qTB code is locally recoverable with locality r.   = CSS(C, C) given in Deﬁnition 10   F∗q, there exists some f   Proof. As described in Section 1.1.1 and formalized in Corollary 34, it suﬃces to show that for each C ⊥ α ⊆ ∈ ∈ as described above, the piecewise linear function f : F∗q → αΩr and f (x) = 0 for x / ∈   | ≤ Fq given by f (x) = x for x   αΩr satisﬁes these criteria, as desired.   r. But because P   C ⊥ such that α   supp(f ) and   It only remains to bound the distance of the qTB code   following result, which directly implies Theorem 3.   . For this purpose, we show the   Theorem 13 (Restatement of Theorem 62). The qTB code parameter r has distance at least   in Deﬁnition 10 with a prime locality   As was mentioned in Section 1.1.2, this bound is reminiscent of the Johnson bound (see e.g. The- orem 7.3.1 of [GRS22]), which in particular implies that a classical code of dimension ℓ and block 1 whose distance approaches the Singleton bound is list-decodable from at least a fraction length q of errors approaching 1   1) as the alphabet size and block length grow large.   It is unclear if there is a deeper reason for this similarity between the Johnson bound and Theorem 62. However, it is interesting that we are able to improve the distance beyond this Johnson-like bound by folding our qTB codes, just as [GR08] introduced folded RS codes to improve beyond the Johnson bound for the list-decoding radius of RS codes.   Proof sketch of Theorem 13. Recall that the distance of C ⊥. As P of any element of C weight at least the value d given in (2). For this purpose, consider any ev(f )   C ⊥, it therefore suﬃces show that every element of C   = CSS(C, C) equals the minimum weight P has   P . At a high level, the proof will proceed as follows. C ∈ F∗q, G also has We deﬁne a polynomial G such that whenever f has multiple roots in a coset xΩr ⊆ many roots in that coset. We can then bound the number of roots of f by bounding the number of roots of G, which we in turn bound by the degree of G. By constructing G to have low degree relative to the number of roots of f , we obtain the desired result.   We now formally deﬁne G. By deﬁnition we may decompose f (X) = g(X) + h(X), where (1+rZ)   1+rZ) evaluates to a nonzero classical TB codeword, and h(X)   g(X) evaluates to a piecewise linear function. Deﬁne the polynomial G(X)   By deﬁnition, the degree of G satisﬁes   Meanwhile, we bound the number of roots of G as follows. For every x such that f (x) = 0 and f (ωi unity ωi   rx) = 0, then   F∗q and every rth root of   r g(ωi i ω−   r h(ωi i ω−   where the second equality above holds because h is piecewise linear. Thus G has a root for every ordered pair (x, ωi r. Summing over all such pairs of roots of f (see Section 6.1 for details), we ﬁnd that the total number of roots of G is at least   rx) of roots of f whose ratio is an rth root of unity ωi   This expression must be bounded above by the RHS of (4); rearranging terms in the resulting inequality yields the desired bound   d for d given in (2).   As described in Section 1.1.2 and Section 1.2.2, we were only able to prove a “Johnson-like” bound on the distance of qTB codes, which does not approach our Singleton-like bounds for qLRCs described in Section 1.1.3. We address this issue by introducing a “folded” version of qTB codes, for which we show the distance does approach the Singleton bound for large localities r. The proof of this distance bound for folded qTB codes (Theorem 2) is quite involved, so in this section we simply provide a brief description of the main ideas involved. The reader is referred to Section 6.2 for the full proof.   We deﬁne folded qTB codes by grouping together symbols of qTB codes as described below.   Deﬁnition 14 (Restatement of Deﬁnition 59). As in Deﬁnition 10, let = CSS(C, C) be the qTB C 1)/r, we deﬁne the folded (q code with parameters q, r, ℓ. Given an additional folding parameter s − | quantum Tamo-Barg (fqTB) code ˜ to be the quantum code of alphabet size qs and block C 1 for F∗q, and then for every i length (q 1)/s],  1, ωsi+1 we block together the s components (each of alphabet size q) at positions q − into a single component (of alphabet size qs) of the folded code ˜ . in C   1)/s obtained as follows. Fix a generator ωq   A folded qTB code by construction inherits the rate and local recoverability of the underlying unfolded qTB code. Thus to prove Theorem 2, we simply need to bound the distance of the fqTB code. For this purpose, deﬁne S as in (1), so that the underlying unfolded qTB code = CSS(C, C) has C = ev(Fq[X]S ). The distance of ˜ by deﬁnition equals the minimum over all codewords C (see Deﬁnition 14) in ev(f ) which f takes at least one nonzero value.   C ⊥ of the number of distinct blocks   At a high level, we bound this minimum distance by considering two types of message poly- Fq[X]S separately. For the ﬁrst type of message polynomial, we nomials f (X) = use a similar argument as described in the proof sketch of Theorem 13 in Section 1.2.2. We are able to leverage the folding to replace the polynomial G(X) in (3) with another polynomial, which consists of the composition of f with a determinant polynomial. This alternative choice of G(X) detects roots of f more eﬃciently relative to its degree, and hence yields a better distance bound (see Claim 68). However, this method breaks down when the coeﬃcients fi of f are supported in a small number of distinct values i (mod r), that is, when there are r distinct values i (mod r) = 0. The reason for the breakdown on these “bad” polynomials f stems from among all i with fi 6 the fact that we need G(X) to be a nonzero polynomial, which becomes more diﬃcult when f has fewer nonzero coeﬃcients.   Fortunately, we can consider such “bad” message polynomials f separately, and instead apply an uncertainty principle (Proposition 66) to bound the weight of the associated codeword (Claim 67). Intuitively, this uncertainty principle implies that if the coeﬃcients fi are zero for most values of i (mod r), then most of the evaluation points in ev(f ) must be nonzero, so ev(f ) has large weight. Combining our bounds from the two types of message polynomials described above, we obtain   a bound on the distance of the fqTB code   , which yields Theorem 2.   Our work leads the the following open questions:   • Can explicit qLRCs be constructed with a better rate-distance-locality tradeoﬀ than given by Theorem 2? Two approaches here are to improve our distance bound for fqTB codes in Theorem 2, or to introduce new constructions of qLRCs for which stronger bounds can be shown. In general, the goal is to close the gap to the Singleton-like bounds in Section 3.   • How does the optimal rate-distance-locality tradeoﬀ of qLRCs diﬀer from that of qLDPC codes? As described in Section 1.1.3, our bounds on qLRCs imply bounds on qLDPC codes, but it is an interesting question whether the additional structure in qLDPC codes can be used to show stronger bounds. This question also points towards the more general line of inquiry into relationships between notions of locality in quantum codes, of which local recoverability and LDPC are two examples of interest.   In this section, we introduce some notation, and then present preliminary deﬁnitions and results pertaining to classical codes, quantum codes, and local recoverability.   y We denote by   N, we let [n] =   .  } For a prime power q, let Fq denote the ﬁnite ﬁeld of order q. For n y = Let F∗q = Fq \\ {  }   [n] xiyi denote the standard dot product. ∈   denote the multiplicative group of Fq. For r   F∗q denote a 1), we let ωr ∈ primitive rth root of unity, and we let Ωr = denote the group of all rth roots of unity. While the choice of ωr is not unique, we typically will think of ﬁxing some (q 1)st root of 1)/r unity ωq −  −   F∗q, and then let ωr = ω(q   N and for x, y   For a ﬁnite alphabet A, we denote the Hamming distance between two strings x, y   dis(x, y) = [n] : xi 6 i |{ denoted dis(X, Y ) = minx denote the Hamming weight of a string x dis(x, y) =   . For two sets X, Y Y dis(x, y). If A is an abelian group (e.g. A = Fq, or A = Fs ∈ = dis(0, x) =   An by An, the minimum Hamming distance is q) we , so that   A quantum channel   a of the qudits will be clear from context. Thus ρ operator ρ : (Ca)⊗ (Ca)⊗ denote the associated density matrix. For a density matrix ρ qudits, we denote the reduced density matrix ρB = TrA   (A) the set of density matrices on a set A of qudits, where the local dimension (A) if ρ is a positive semi-deﬁnite Hermitian A, we let ψ = (A) ψ A is a subset of the   A of trace 1.

If C is a classical code of block length n, dimension k > 0, and distance d, then   − Fn A classical (linear) code can be expressed as the image of a (linear) encoding map Enc : Fk q that maps messages to codewords encoding the messages. However, we will mostly consider the space of codewords without reference to the encoding map.   Throughout this paper we restrict attention to linear or Fq-linear codes, as will be clear from context. In particular, Fq-linear codes will arise from linear codes over Fq by “folding”, that is, by grouping together symbols of the linear code into larger symbols.   Deﬁnition 17. A classical locally recoverable code (cLRC) of locality r, block length n, [a]n together with a set of local recovery maps Reci and alphabet size a is a classical code C for every i   [n] satisfying the following properties:   1. There exists a set Ii ⊆   [n] of size   r with i   Ii such that Reci is a function Reci :   2. It holds for every codeword c   We specify that i   Ii for notational convenience due to the following well known form of linear cLRCs.

Note that the running times of the above algorithms implicitly give bounds on the lengths of   the lists they output.   In this section, we describe relevant background on quantum codes.   Deﬁnition 24. A quantum code of block length n, dimension k, and local dimension (that is, alphabet size) a is a ak-dimensional linear subspace   The deﬁnition above of a quantum code as a linear subspace of Hilbert space assumes a unitary encoding map, as we may express for a unitary encoding map i ∈ Enc : (Ca)⊗ n. In this paper we restrict attention to codes with such unitary encodings unless explicitly stated otherwise. However, there are more general coding schemes with arbitrary channel encodings; we leave it as an open question whether such non-unitary encodings could be beneﬁcial for local recovery.   Below we deﬁne the distance of a quantum code as one plus the maximum number of erasures   that the code can correct.   Deﬁnition 25.

If from erasures in some set S   is a quantum code of block length n that can decode   [n], then the reduced density matrix ψS is the same for all ψ   The following well known quantum analogue of Proposition 16 presents a tradeoﬀ between distance and dimension for quantum codes.

We will ﬁrst need to deﬁne the Pauli operators.   Deﬁnition 28. Let Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p.

We therefore let a subspace, or (by slight abuse of terminology) subgroup, of q be any P q ∼= F2n subset that is a Fq-subspace under the isomorphism n q . Therefore in particular we require a P q to be closed under the action of Fq. Furthermore, although we deﬁned n n q to be “subgroup” of P n the group of Paulis modulo a global phase, we abuse notation and call a subgroup of q abelian if all the operators in the subgroup commute with each other, taking into account the global phase. s We also denote ( q ; this group will naturally arise when we consider folded stabilizer codes in Section 5.3.   sn q , which we interpret as the group of length-n strings of elements in   Deﬁnition 29.

The result is standard, so we just provide a brief outline. Let CX = ker HX and and an error channel CZ = ker HZ. Given a corrupted code state ρ = E e of the codeword qudits, the decoder Dec(ρ) ﬁrst performs syndrome measurements E for HX, HZ to collapse ρ to EψE†, so that the error on ψ is collapsed to some Pauli E = X bX Z bZ e, where sX = HXbX and sZ = HZbZ are the outputs of the syndrome measurements. of weight Then for each permutation (α, β) of (X, Z), the decoder performs Gaussian elimination to ﬁnd some Cα. The decoder aα such that Hαaα = sα, so that aα = cα + bα for some (currently unknown) cα ∈ C ⊥β . Letting b′α = aα − then runs Decα(aα), which outputs cα + pα for some pα ∈ pα (cα + pα) = bα − and E′ = X b′ Z , the decoder then applies E′† to output E′†EψE†E′ = ψ. This ﬁnal equality holds because by assumption X pX and Z pZ are stabilizers of   , so they preserve ψ.   The running time of Dec deﬁned above is TX(n, a) + TZ (n, a) + O(n3 poly log a) because outside of the calls to DecX and DecZ , all operations run in time O(n2 poly log a), except the Gaussian elimination which runs in time O(n3 poly log a).

A cohort study conducted in Iran revealed\nthat  the  incidence  rates  of  COVID-19,  hos-\npitalization,  and  death  following  vaccina-\ntion  were  528.2,  55.8,  and  4.1  per  1,000,000\nperson-days,  respectively  [8].  Another  study\nconducted  in  India  on  vaccinated  individuals\nshowed that breakthrough infections occurred\nin 7.91% of cases, with older individuals (≥61\nyears) and males being at higher risk [9]. Be-\nfore the commencement of mass vaccination,\nthe primary factors that posed a high risk for\nsevere COVID-19 were recognized to be old\nage, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic\nrespiratory diseases, obesity, being male, kid-\nney  diseases,  hematological  malignancy,  or-\ngan transplantation, mental disability, as well\nas liver, neurological, or autoimmune diseases\n[10]. These same risk factors may contribute\nto contracting COVID-19 after vaccination.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nNumerous  factors  can  influence  the  body’s\nresponse to vaccines, including inherent char-\nacteristics  like  age,  gender,  genetics,  and  ex-\nisting  health  conditions,  as  well  as  external\nfactors  like  immune  status,  microbiota,  in-\nfections,  and  medication  use.  Lifestyle  and\nbehavioral factors like smoking, alcohol con-\nsumption, physical activity, and sleep patterns,\nas  well  as  nutritional  factors  like  body  mass\nindex and micronutrient levels, can also play\na  role.  Additionally,  the  type  of  vaccine,  its\ndosage,  adjuvant,  and  administration  sched-\nule, site, route, and timing, as well as any co-\nadministered  drugs,  can  affect  the  vaccine’s\nefficacy [11]. However, the precise impact of\nthese  factors  on  the  development  of  protec-\ntive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is not yet\nfully understood.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe  results  of  the  Iranian  cohort  study\nshowed that the AZD1222 Vaxzevria vaccine\nwas  most  effective  in  preventing  COVID-19\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncases,  hospitalizations,  and  deaths.  Inactivat-\ned vaccines (using Vero Cell) had the lowest\neffectiveness.  Diabetes  and  respiratory,  car-\ndiac, and renal diseases as well as neurologi-\ncal and mental disorders were associated with\na  higher  risk  of  contracting  COVID-19  after\nvaccination [8]. According to a study conduct-\ned in France, the likelihood of being hospital-\nized  due  to  COVID-19  increases  gradually\nwith age, with the 85-89-year age group being\nfour times more at risk than the group aged 45-\n54 years [12]. Likewise, the likelihood of mor-\ntality while in the hospital rises considerably\nwith advancing age, as those between the ages\nof  85  and  89  face  a  38-fold  increase  in  risk\ncompared  to  those  aged  45  to  54.  Addition-\nally, people who have compromised immune\nsystems  and  have  received  vaccinations,  or\nwho suffer from particular comorbidities such\nas  lung  and  liver  ailments,  chronic  kidney\nfailure,  diabetes,  cardiovascular  illnesses,  or\nneurological disorders, are at a greater risk of\nexperiencing severe cases of COVID-19 [12].\nIndividuals  who  have  cancer  are  more  sus-\nceptible  to  being  hospitalized  and  experienc-\ning  mortality  after  contracting  SARS-CoV-2\n[13]. In addition, cancer patients have a higher\nlikelihood  of  experiencing  breakthrough  in-\nfections  of  SARS-CoV-2  since  the  efficacy\nof  vaccines  is  lower  in  this  cohort  compared\nto  the  control  population  [14].  Administer-\ning  oral  corticosteroids  on  a  long-term  basis\nmay  result  in  potential  immunosuppression,\nthereby elevating the likelihood of contracting\nCOVID-19 [12]. Consequently, an insufficient\nantibody response can escalate the occurrence\nof  COVID-19  cases,  hospitalizations,  and\nfatalities  following  COVID-19  vaccination.\nThe prior SARS-CoV-2 infection remarkably\ndecreases  the  risk  of  breakthrough  infection\n[15]. When the time after vaccination increas-\nes,  the  titer  of  specific  antibodies  decreases.\nTherefore, when the antibody titer falls below\nthe  protective  threshold,  the  risk  of  contract-\ning  COVID-19  increases.  The  determina-\ntion  of  the  protection  duration  after  primary\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nvaccination  against  COVID-19  is  important\nto implement booster vaccination and extend\nprotection.  Moreover,  the  potency  of  vac-\ncines may diminish as fresh strains of the vi-\nrus develop. When the delta variant prevailed\nbetween  August  and  November  2021,  the\noccurrence  of  COVID-19  infections  among\nfully  vaccinated  individuals  in  the  US  popu-\nlation  was  roughly  100  cases  per  100,000.\nMoreover,  some  breakthrough  infections  can\nbe  attributed  to  viral-related  factors,  such  as\nvariants, virus transmissibility, infection load,\nincubation  period,  pathogenicity,  and  virus\nimmune evasion [16]. It has been reported that\nthe  serum  samples  from  vaccinated  persons\ndisplayed  3-15,  1.4-3,  and  25-40  fold  reduc-\ntion in antibody neutralizing capability against\nBeta, Delta, and Omicron variants, respective-\nly compared to those of the earlier variants of\nSARS-CoV-2 [16]. As the S protein of Omi-\ncron variants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5)\nis different than that of the wild-type virus, the\nantibody neutralizing capability against Omi-\ncron variants is lower in individuals who were\nvaccinated with WT-based vaccines [17]. The\nCOVID-19 epidemic curve also can influence\nbreakthrough infections.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nCumulative evidence indicates that the risk\nof  severe  infection  and  COVID-19-related\nmortality is substantially lower in vaccinated\nindividuals compared to unvaccinated people.\nAlthough there are concerns about the poten-\ntial negative effects of vaccination on the virus\nand  on  health,  studies  have  shown  that  vac-\ncination against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce the\nrisk of death by 34% and the risk of contract-\ning  COVID-19  by  15%,  compared  to  those\nwho  are  unvaccinated  [18]. A  systematic  re-\nview  and  meta-analysis  has  also  found  that\nduring a period dominated by the Delta vari-\nant,  unvaccinated  individuals  are  at  a  higher\nrisk  of  contracting  the  virus  than  those  who\nare fully vaccinated, regardless of the variant.\nHowever, there were no significant differences\nin the likelihood of hospitalization, mechani-\ncal  ventilation,  or  mortality  after  infection.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nNonetheless,  unvaccinated  individuals  had\na  higher  need  for  oxygen  supplementation\n[19].

Two\nyears after COVID-19 became a pandemic cri-\nsis, the mechanisms behind the major adverse\nhealth  effects  remain  poorly  understood.  Re-\ncently, a group of Japanese researchers, head-\ned by Murata [20], reported four instances of\ndeath  occurring  after  the  second  dose  of  the\nCOVID-19  vaccine.  Despite  conducting  an\nautopsy, the cause of death could not be deter-\nmined. The  team  discovered  that  vaccination\nled to the upregulation of 399 genes, particu-\nlarly  those  involved  in  neutrophil  degranula-\ntion and cytokine signaling, while 154 genes\nwere downregulated. Based on their findings,\nthey concluded that vaccination could result in\nimmune dysregulation, specifically a cytokine\nstorm [20].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAccording to a previous study by Jafarzadeh\net al. [5], although there is a small chance of\nrare side effects such as temporary thyroid is-\nsues, getting vaccinated has a positive impact\non ending the pandemic and decreasing mor-\ntality rates. Recent death reports do not seem\nto be able to change the existence of a net ben-\nefit for vaccination. However, we need to first\nassess if the observed death events are truly re-\nlated to vaccination or just show a random co-\nincidence. When we consider the total number\nof vaccine doses used in Japan, 4 death cases\nafter vaccination can be a random coincidence.\nIf the coincidence is ruled out, then we should\ninvestigate what potential mechanisms may be\ninvolved in these death events. Figure 1 shows\nsome  of  the  most  likely  mechanisms  behind\nthe post-vaccination death reports.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nFigure 1: Different theories about the rare post-vaccination death reports\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe Virus is to stay\nThere is a growing body of evidence indicat-\ning  that  SARS-CoV-2  will  not  be  eradicated\nand  will  continue  to  spread  among  humans.\nSome scientists predict that future generations\nwill develop greater resistance to COVID-19,\nresulting  in  a  reduced  risk  of  severe  illness.\nOberemok et al. have expressed a similar view\nin their article SARS-CoV-2 will persist in the\nhuman population: an opinion from the point\nof  view  of  the  virus-host  relationship”  pub-\nlished  in  Inflammation  Research,  stating  that\nthe virus will persist in the human population\n[21]. They believe that the virus will eventu-\nally  lead  to  a  more  resilient  population,  par-\nticularly  among  individuals  of  reproductive\nage, despite the fatalities caused by it. The au-\nthors  have  also  highlighted  the  impossibility\nof  preventing  the  virus  from  generating  new\nstrains  and  posing  a  threat  to  the  world  with\nnew pandemics due to natural genetic mecha-\nnisms  of  mutations  and  recombination  [21].\nBevelacqua and Mortazavi have noted that the\nissue may be much more complex than natu-\nral  selection  [22].  As  less-efficient  vaccines\nand  antiviral  drugs  might  drive  the  virus  to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nevolutionary processes [23], the adverse out-\ncomes  of  exerting  selective  pressure  by  the\nadvent  of  vaccines  or  new  therapies  should\ncarefully  be  considered  [24]. A  report  in  the\nprestigious  journal  Science  from  three  years\nago  noted  that  as  the  virus  spreads  through\npeople  who  have  not  been  exposed  to  it  be-\nfore, there may not be much pressure for it to\nevolve. However, the introduction of vaccines\nor new treatments could change this and force\nthe virus to adapt and evolve [24]. The trans-\nmission of SARS-CoV-2 is affected by various\nfactors  such  as  the  host’s  immune  response,\nviral replication, and mutation rate [25].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nA  Physics  Perspective:  Low-Dose  Radia-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\ntion Therapy Can Change the Game\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nPhysical  principles  were  the  basis  of  many\nguidelines  in  the  prevention  of  COVID-19\nspreading. For example, the advantage of the\nEarth’s  gravity  was  the  basis  of  social  dis-\ntancing. Given this, it has been discussed that\nCOVID-19 fatality in space might be signifi-\ncantly  higher  than  that  on  Earth  [26].

The  revised\nguidance puts less emphasis on social distanc-\ning and removes quarantine requirements for\nexposure to the virus, places less emphasis on\nscreening those without symptoms, and updates\nCOVID-19 protocols in schools. The Washing-\nton Post has called the new guideline a strate-\ngic shift “CDC loosens coronavirus guidance,\nsignaling strategic shift”. Moreover, CDC has\naccepted that SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay “We\nknow that Covid-19 is here to stay,” said Greta\nMassetti, an epidemiologist at CDC.\nthe\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\ntherapeutic  applications\nof  physics,  Low  Dose  Radiation  Therapy\n(LDRT) has been shown to lower death rates\nin individuals with bacterial and viral-related\npneumonia  [27].  Uncontrolled  Inflammatory\nresponses  as  well  as  cytokine  storms  are  the\nkey players in the pathogenesis of COVID-19\n[10, 28]. In early April 2020, the first proposal\nfor using LDRT to treat COVID-19-associated\npneumonia  was  made.  However,  X-ray  ther-\napy  has  been  used  to  treat  pneumonia  since\nthe pre-antibiotic era of the twentieth century,\nalthough  its  effectiveness  is  uncertain.  In  a\n2013  review  by  Calabrese  and  Dhavan  [29],\n15  reports  were  presented,  covering  863  pa-\ntients with severe pneumonia caused by vari-\nous  pathogens.  LDRT  affects  leukocytes,  en-\ndothelial cells, and fibroblasts, as well as the\nproduction  of  cytokines  and  chemokines,  in\norder  to  regulate  inflammation  [27,  30,  31].\nLDRT  may  enhance  antiviral  immune  re-\nsponses by increasing Natural Killer (NK) and\nCD8+  T-cell-dependent  activity,  as  well  as\nIFN-γ generation [32, 33]. Given this consid-\neration, two years after the pandemic, it seems\nthat physical treatment methods can compete\nwith  pharmacological  treatments.  Regarding\nreinfection, more studies are needed to answer\nthe  key  question  of  whether  physical  treat-\nment methods such as LDRT can decrease the\nrates of serious reinfection and death after re-\nceiving the 2nd or booster doses of COVID-19\nvaccines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nConclusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  resulted  in\nthe largest global immunization effort in his-\ntory. While the overall outcome of the vacci-\nnation has been positive and has saved many\nlives,  there  have  been  reports  of  negative\nhealth  effects  and  even  deaths.  Therefore,  it\nis crucial to comprehend the factors that trig-\nger adverse health effects to effectively man-\nage  future  breakthrough  infections. Although\nthere  are  indications  that  future  generations\nwill  be  more  resistant  to  COVID-19  and  the\nrisk of severe illness will decrease over time,\nit is essential to understand how lifestyle and\nbehavioral  factors,  such  as  smoking,  alcohol\nconsumption,  physical  activity,  and  sleep,\nand  nutritional  factors  like  body  mass  index\nand  micronutrients,  affect  the  outcome.  Ad-\nditionally,  the  effects  of  various  vaccine  fac-\ntors,  including  vaccine  type,  product,  adju-\nvant, dose, and administration factors such as\nschedule, site, route, time of vaccination, and\nco-administered drugs, should be evaluated to\nenhance treatment methods during future pan-\ndemics.  Furthermore,  the  potential  effective-\nness of physical treatment methods like Low\nDose  Radiation  Therapy  (LDRT)  should  be\ncompared to pharmacological treatments.\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nAuthors’ Contribution\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSAR.

         " Breakthrough and  Death Infection after  COVID-19  Vaccination:  A  Physics Perspective   , Abdollah Jafarzadeh (PhD)2, Seyed Ali Reza Mortazavi (MD)1 Abdolkarim  Ghadimi-Moghadam  (MD)3,  Seyed  Mohammad Javad Mortazavi (PhD)4, Masoud Haghani (PhD)5, Ali Ghadimi- Moghadam (PhD)6, Lembit Sihver (PhD)7,8,9*   and  inactivated  vaccines  for  universal  vaccination  against COVID-19 have been verified by the World Health Organization (WHO)  [1,  2]. As  of August  12,  2022,  over  12.3  billion  vaccine  dos- es  were  administered  worldwide  [3].  COVID-19  vaccines  can  protect against severe forms of the disease by producing anti-spike (S) neutral- izing antibodies [4]. However, some individuals have reported various side effects, including thyroid, neurologic, cutaneous, and hematologic disorders  after  receiving  the  vaccine  [5-7]. Although  several  molecu- lar mechanisms have been proposed for these side effects [5], the exact cause is still unknown and requires further investigation. It is important to note that reports of side effects after vaccination do not necessarily indicate causality. To better understand the subject, further prospective   Seyed Ali Reza Mortazavi, et al longitudinal  studies  using  control  groups  are needed as the world continues its largest uni- versal immunization effort.   The  occurrence  of  some  cases  of  break- through infection, hospitalizations, and deaths were  reported  after  COVID-19  vaccination [8]. A cohort study conducted in Iran revealed that  the  incidence  rates  of  COVID-19,  hos- pitalization,  and  death  following  vaccina- tion  were  528.2,  55.8,  and  4.1  per  1,000,000 person-days,  respectively  [8].  Another  study conducted  in  India  on  vaccinated  individuals showed that breakthrough infections occurred in 7.91% of cases, with older individuals (≥61 years) and males being at higher risk [9]. Be- fore the commencement of mass vaccination, the primary factors that posed a high risk for severe COVID-19 were recognized to be old age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, being male, kid- ney  diseases,  hematological  malignancy,  or- gan transplantation, mental disability, as well as liver, neurological, or autoimmune diseases [10]. These same risk factors may contribute to contracting COVID-19 after vaccination.   Numerous  factors  can  influence  the  body’s response to vaccines, including inherent char- acteristics  like  age,  gender,  genetics,  and  ex- isting  health  conditions,  as  well  as  external factors  like  immune  status,  microbiota,  in- fections,  and  medication  use.  Lifestyle  and behavioral factors like smoking, alcohol con- sumption, physical activity, and sleep patterns, as  well  as  nutritional  factors  like  body  mass index and micronutrient levels, can also play a  role.  Additionally,  the  type  of  vaccine,  its dosage,  adjuvant,  and  administration  sched- ule, site, route, and timing, as well as any co- administered  drugs,  can  affect  the  vaccine’s efficacy [11]. However, the precise impact of these  factors  on  the  development  of  protec- tive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is not yet fully understood.   The  results  of  the  Iranian  cohort  study showed that the AZD1222 Vaxzevria vaccine was  most  effective  in  preventing  COVID-19   cases,  hospitalizations,  and  deaths.  Inactivat- ed vaccines (using Vero Cell) had the lowest effectiveness.  Diabetes  and  respiratory,  car- diac, and renal diseases as well as neurologi- cal and mental disorders were associated with a  higher  risk  of  contracting  COVID-19  after vaccination [8]. According to a study conduct- ed in France, the likelihood of being hospital- ized  due  to  COVID-19  increases  gradually with age, with the 85-89-year age group being four times more at risk than the group aged 45- 54 years [12]. Likewise, the likelihood of mor- tality while in the hospital rises considerably with advancing age, as those between the ages of  85  and  89  face  a  38-fold  increase  in  risk compared  to  those  aged  45  to  54.  Addition- ally, people who have compromised immune systems  and  have  received  vaccinations,  or who suffer from particular comorbidities such as  lung  and  liver  ailments,  chronic  kidney failure,  diabetes,  cardiovascular  illnesses,  or neurological disorders, are at a greater risk of experiencing severe cases of COVID-19 [12]. Individuals  who  have  cancer  are  more  sus- ceptible  to  being  hospitalized  and  experienc- ing  mortality  after  contracting  SARS-CoV-2 [13]. In addition, cancer patients have a higher likelihood  of  experiencing  breakthrough  in- fections  of  SARS-CoV-2  since  the  efficacy of  vaccines  is  lower  in  this  cohort  compared to  the  control  population  [14].  Administer- ing  oral  corticosteroids  on  a  long-term  basis may  result  in  potential  immunosuppression, thereby elevating the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 [12]. Consequently, an insufficient antibody response can escalate the occurrence of  COVID-19  cases,  hospitalizations,  and fatalities  following  COVID-19  vaccination. The prior SARS-CoV-2 infection remarkably decreases  the  risk  of  breakthrough  infection [15]. When the time after vaccination increas- es,  the  titer  of  specific  antibodies  decreases. Therefore, when the antibody titer falls below the  protective  threshold,  the  risk  of  contract- ing  COVID-19  increases.  The  determina- tion  of  the  protection  duration  after  primary   vaccination  against  COVID-19  is  important to implement booster vaccination and extend protection.  Moreover,  the  potency  of  vac- cines may diminish as fresh strains of the vi- rus develop. When the delta variant prevailed between  August  and  November  2021,  the occurrence  of  COVID-19  infections  among fully  vaccinated  individuals  in  the  US  popu- lation  was  roughly  100  cases  per  100,000. Moreover,  some  breakthrough  infections  can be  attributed  to  viral-related  factors,  such  as variants, virus transmissibility, infection load, incubation  period,  pathogenicity,  and  virus immune evasion [16]. It has been reported that the  serum  samples  from  vaccinated  persons displayed  3-15,  1.4-3,  and  25-40  fold  reduc- tion in antibody neutralizing capability against Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants, respective- ly compared to those of the earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2 [16]. As the S protein of Omi- cron variants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5) is different than that of the wild-type virus, the antibody neutralizing capability against Omi- cron variants is lower in individuals who were vaccinated with WT-based vaccines [17]. The COVID-19 epidemic curve also can influence breakthrough infections.   Cumulative evidence indicates that the risk of  severe  infection  and  COVID-19-related mortality is substantially lower in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated people. Although there are concerns about the poten- tial negative effects of vaccination on the virus and  on  health,  studies  have  shown  that  vac- cination against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce the risk of death by 34% and the risk of contract- ing  COVID-19  by  15%,  compared  to  those who  are  unvaccinated  [18]. A  systematic  re- view  and  meta-analysis  has  also  found  that during a period dominated by the Delta vari- ant,  unvaccinated  individuals  are  at  a  higher risk  of  contracting  the  virus  than  those  who are fully vaccinated, regardless of the variant. However, there were no significant differences in the likelihood of hospitalization, mechani- cal  ventilation,  or  mortality  after  infection.   Nonetheless,  unvaccinated  individuals  had a  higher  need  for  oxygen  supplementation [19]. To effectively manage breakthrough in- fections,  it  is  important  to  consider  various crucial factors.   The Risk of Death after Vaccination Despite the inevitable crucial role of the rap- id development of COVID-19 vaccines in the effective management of the pandemic, there are  reports  indicating  adverse  health  effects ranging  from  transient  thyroid  dysfunction [5]  to  death  [20]  following  vaccination. Two years after COVID-19 became a pandemic cri- sis, the mechanisms behind the major adverse health  effects  remain  poorly  understood.  Re- cently, a group of Japanese researchers, head- ed by Murata [20], reported four instances of death  occurring  after  the  second  dose  of  the COVID-19  vaccine.  Despite  conducting  an autopsy, the cause of death could not be deter- mined. The  team  discovered  that  vaccination led to the upregulation of 399 genes, particu- larly  those  involved  in  neutrophil  degranula- tion and cytokine signaling, while 154 genes were downregulated. Based on their findings, they concluded that vaccination could result in immune dysregulation, specifically a cytokine storm [20].   According to a previous study by Jafarzadeh et al. [5], although there is a small chance of rare side effects such as temporary thyroid is- sues, getting vaccinated has a positive impact on ending the pandemic and decreasing mor- tality rates. Recent death reports do not seem to be able to change the existence of a net ben- efit for vaccination. However, we need to first assess if the observed death events are truly re- lated to vaccination or just show a random co- incidence. When we consider the total number of vaccine doses used in Japan, 4 death cases after vaccination can be a random coincidence. If the coincidence is ruled out, then we should investigate what potential mechanisms may be involved in these death events. Figure 1 shows some  of  the  most  likely  mechanisms  behind the post-vaccination death reports.   Figure 1: Different theories about the rare post-vaccination death reports   The Virus is to stay There is a growing body of evidence indicat- ing  that  SARS-CoV-2  will  not  be  eradicated and  will  continue  to  spread  among  humans. Some scientists predict that future generations will develop greater resistance to COVID-19, resulting  in  a  reduced  risk  of  severe  illness. Oberemok et al. have expressed a similar view in their article SARS-CoV-2 will persist in the human population: an opinion from the point of  view  of  the  virus-host  relationship”  pub- lished  in  Inflammation  Research,  stating  that the virus will persist in the human population [21]. They believe that the virus will eventu- ally  lead  to  a  more  resilient  population,  par- ticularly  among  individuals  of  reproductive age, despite the fatalities caused by it. The au- thors  have  also  highlighted  the  impossibility of  preventing  the  virus  from  generating  new strains  and  posing  a  threat  to  the  world  with new pandemics due to natural genetic mecha- nisms  of  mutations  and  recombination  [21]. Bevelacqua and Mortazavi have noted that the issue may be much more complex than natu- ral  selection  [22].  As  less-efficient  vaccines and  antiviral  drugs  might  drive  the  virus  to   evolutionary processes [23], the adverse out- comes  of  exerting  selective  pressure  by  the advent  of  vaccines  or  new  therapies  should carefully  be  considered  [24]. A  report  in  the prestigious  journal  Science  from  three  years ago  noted  that  as  the  virus  spreads  through people  who  have  not  been  exposed  to  it  be- fore, there may not be much pressure for it to evolve. However, the introduction of vaccines or new treatments could change this and force the virus to adapt and evolve [24]. The trans- mission of SARS-CoV-2 is affected by various factors  such  as  the  host’s  immune  response, viral replication, and mutation rate [25].   A  Physics  Perspective:  Low-Dose  Radia-   tion Therapy Can Change the Game   Physical  principles  were  the  basis  of  many guidelines  in  the  prevention  of  COVID-19 spreading. For example, the advantage of the Earth’s  gravity  was  the  basis  of  social  dis- tancing. Given this, it has been discussed that COVID-19 fatality in space might be signifi- cantly  higher  than  that  on  Earth  [26].  How- ever  as  the  pendulum  of  COVID-19  science has  been  always  swinging, The  US  CDC  re- leased a guidance for the national response to   COVID-19  on August  11,  2022. The  revised guidance puts less emphasis on social distanc- ing and removes quarantine requirements for exposure to the virus, places less emphasis on screening those without symptoms, and updates COVID-19 protocols in schools. The Washing- ton Post has called the new guideline a strate- gic shift “CDC loosens coronavirus guidance, signaling strategic shift”. Moreover, CDC has accepted that SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay “We know that Covid-19 is here to stay,” said Greta Massetti, an epidemiologist at CDC. the   therapeutic  applications of  physics,  Low  Dose  Radiation  Therapy (LDRT) has been shown to lower death rates in individuals with bacterial and viral-related pneumonia  [27].  Uncontrolled  Inflammatory responses  as  well  as  cytokine  storms  are  the key players in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [10, 28]. In early April 2020, the first proposal for using LDRT to treat COVID-19-associated pneumonia  was  made.  However,  X-ray  ther- apy  has  been  used  to  treat  pneumonia  since the pre-antibiotic era of the twentieth century, although  its  effectiveness  is  uncertain.  In  a 2013  review  by  Calabrese  and  Dhavan  [29], 15  reports  were  presented,  covering  863  pa- tients with severe pneumonia caused by vari- ous  pathogens.  LDRT  affects  leukocytes,  en- dothelial cells, and fibroblasts, as well as the production  of  cytokines  and  chemokines,  in order  to  regulate  inflammation  [27,  30,  31]. LDRT  may  enhance  antiviral  immune  re- sponses by increasing Natural Killer (NK) and CD8+  T-cell-dependent  activity,  as  well  as IFN-γ generation [32, 33]. Given this consid- eration, two years after the pandemic, it seems that physical treatment methods can compete with  pharmacological  treatments.  Regarding reinfection, more studies are needed to answer the  key  question  of  whether  physical  treat- ment methods such as LDRT can decrease the rates of serious reinfection and death after re- ceiving the 2nd or booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines.   The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  resulted  in the largest global immunization effort in his- tory. While the overall outcome of the vacci- nation has been positive and has saved many lives,  there  have  been  reports  of  negative health  effects  and  even  deaths.  Therefore,  it is crucial to comprehend the factors that trig- ger adverse health effects to effectively man- age  future  breakthrough  infections. Although there  are  indications  that  future  generations will  be  more  resistant  to  COVID-19  and  the risk of severe illness will decrease over time, it is essential to understand how lifestyle and behavioral  factors,  such  as  smoking,  alcohol consumption,  physical  activity,  and  sleep, and  nutritional  factors  like  body  mass  index and  micronutrients,  affect  the  outcome.  Ad- ditionally,  the  effects  of  various  vaccine  fac- tors,  including  vaccine  type,  product,  adju- vant, dose, and administration factors such as schedule, site, route, time of vaccination, and co-administered drugs, should be evaluated to enhance treatment methods during future pan- demics.  Furthermore,  the  potential  effective- ness of physical treatment methods like Low Dose  Radiation  Therapy  (LDRT)  should  be compared to pharmacological treatments.   SAR.  Mortazavi,  SMJ.

However,  multiple  organs  (i.e.  target  area  and  non-target  area)  are\ncontained in a set of images, the boundaries between organ and background may exist indistinct phenomenon,\nand  the  tissues  in  morphology  and  outline  tend  to  be  variable.  All  these  factors  bring  challenge  to  accurate\norgan segmentation. In recent years, several medical imaging analysis methods based on neural networks are\nproposed for organ segmentation1–6. For example, Hu et al. firstly trained a three-dimensional convolutional\nneural network to predict the probability maps of target regions. Then, time-implicit multi-phase level-set is used\nto optimize current abdominal multi-organ segmentation model1. Chlebus et al. proposed an automatic liver\ntumor segmentation method based on a two-dimensional convolutional neural network, following an object-\nbased postprocessing to refine the segmentation results2. Liu et al. raised an automatic framework to achieve\norgan segmentation from CT scans, where simple linear iterative clustering and support vector machine are used\nto roughly classify pixels, and convolutional neural network is involved to achieve precise boundary3. Ren et al.\npresented an interleaved three-dimensional convolutional neural network to segment small tissues of head and\nneck from CT images. Multiscale patches are firstly collected for more image appearance information, then the\nindividual CNNs are interleaved to refine segmented tissues4. Huo et al. designed an automated liver attenuation\nestimation method, i.e., liver attenuation ROI-based measurement (ALARM). A previous deep convolutional\nneural network SS-Net is firstly used to segment liver. Based on liver segmentation results and morphological\noperations, several regions of interests are obtained to achieve attenuation estimation5.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nIn this paper, in order to preserve more details for segmentation, we design two sets of novel constraints\n(i.e. auxiliary constraintand refined constraint) on the basis of convolutional neural network to extract organs\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.5**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\n1School of Aviation Operations and Services, Air Force Aviation University, Changchun 130000, China. 2Department\nof Rehabilitation Medicine, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200336,\nChina.  3Yuanshen  Rehabilitation  Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School  of  Medicine, Shanghai  200025,\nChina. email: limy022@sjtu.edu.cn\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.0**t== 1.0**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nScientific Reports |         (2025) 15:2036\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.0**t== 1.0**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86087-8\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nof  interest  from  medical  images.  To  obtain  auxiliary  constraint,  we  involve  convolutional  structure  into  the\nconventional segmentation model, and these two parts are trained in a manner of minmax two-player game,\nthen a novel adversarial mechanism is built. The conventional segmentation model acts as a generator while\nthe  convolutional  structure  acts  as  a  discriminator.  This  contributes  to  enhance  the  similarity  between  the\npredicted segmentation maps and their corresponding ground truths. Specifically, in each training iteration, the\noutput probability maps from generator (i.e. segmentation network) and the corresponding truths are sent into\ndiscriminator (i.e. convolutional structure). Then, the discriminator measures the nuance between the synthetic\nsample and the original image distributions, where auxiliary constraint is used as the performance measurement.\nIn  the  meantime,  the  generator  starts  training  according  to  the  obtained  feedback  from  discriminator,  with\nthe  purpose  of  synthesizing  so  authentic  samples  that  cannot  be  distinguished  from  original  images  by  the\ndiscriminator. This helps to improve the quality of the output segmentation maps.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAs for the refined constraint, we further apply a set of convolutional structure into the segmentation model\nwith auxiliary constraint to build another group of adversarial mechanism, which contributes to preservation\nof detailed information for segmentation. Specifically, prior to training the adversarial network with auxiliary\nconstraint, we firstly locate the deconvolutional layer which produces the predicted maps in current network.\nThen,  we  further  involve  an  adversarial  mechanism  before  the  located  deconvolutional  layer.  That  is,  a  new\nconvolutional structure is introduced as a discriminator to establish the second adversarial mechanism. At this\nmoment, refined constraint is applied to measure the subtlety between the original and the synthetic distributions.\nThe procedure described above is equivalent to supply two constraints on conventional segmentation model,\ncontributing to preservation of details for segmentation.

Generative adversarial network consists of two competing parts (i.e. generator and discriminator) and\nit obeys a minmax two-player game to train the network. When inputting noise z into generator, a set of fake\nsamples will be produced. And these samples and their corresponding ground truths are used as input images\nto  train  discriminator,  which  can  be  regarded  as  enlarging  the  training  datasets  for  the  discriminator.  Then\nback  propagation  algorithm  is  involved  to  further  update  the  parameters  of  generator.  The  above  procedure\nis  an  iterative  process.  In  this  process,  the  ultimate  goal  of  generator  is  to  produce  samples  which  are  so\nauthentic that the discriminator has difficulty distinguishing them from original images. The ultimate intention\nof discriminator is to accurately distinguish between synthetic samples and real images.

This helps segmentor to obtain\na further training and reach a steady state more quickly, thus achieving better segmentation performance. In\nthis section, we defined the total energy function of segmentation model as auxiliary constraint. That is to say,\nthe auxiliary constraint here performs a regression task, which consists of two items and lower values represent\nbetter performance, as shown in Eq. (2):\n**BLOCK**fs== 6.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nLAuxiliary =\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nPG(seg)log (1\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nDθ D (Gθ G (Y m)))\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nG and D represent generator and discriminator, and θG and θD respectively represent the parameters of G and\nD.

Specifically,  based  on  the  model  with  auxiliary  constraint,\nanother discriminator is introduced to construct a new adversarial mechanism, which is set behind the fourth\ndeconvolutional  layer  in  segmentor.  In  current  segmentation  model,  the  energy  function  from  conventional\nnetwork rules supreme compared with the involved adversarial constraints. This scheme gives the flexibility to\nuse the specific competing relationship in GAN, which involves two constraints into segmentor to refine energy\nfunction, thus improve information preservation capacity to boost segmentation performance. The second set\nof convolutional layers in this part is identical to the discriminator in model with auxiliary constraint described\nin “Auxiliary constraint for organ segmentation”.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAs shown in Fig.  2, on basis of the  model with auxiliary constraint, the predicted probability  maps from\nthe fourth deconvolutional layer in basic segmentation model and their ground truths are measured by dice\nfunction,  and  then  a  second  basic  loss  corresponding  to  current  segmentor  is  obtained.  Then,  the  predicted\nprobability maps from the fourth deconvolutional layer and their corresponding ground truths are used as the\ninputting images for an adversarial network. Thus, an extra constraint for current segmentation network and\na  new  adversarial  regression  function  for  this  adversarial  network  are  obtained.

The obtained ASD optimizes 0.93 mm, 0.99 mm and 1.00 mm\ncompared to Wang et al.28 (0.3 mm vs. 1.23 mm), Wu et al.26 (0.3 mm vs. 1.29 mm) and Gauriau et al.27 (0.3 mm\nvs. 1.3 mm). Meanwhile, the obtained VOE optimizes 0.37% and 0.67% compared to Wang et al.28 (7.2% vs.\n7.57%) and Wu et al.26 (7.2% vs. 7.87%). The DSC score of methods Liu et al.3 and Liao et al.29 are respectively\n1.13%  (96.3%  vs.  97.43%)  and  0.9%  (96.3%  vs.  97.2%)  higher  than  our  proposed  model.  While  its  obtained\nASD optimizes 1.18 mm and 0.8 mm compared to Liu et al.3 (0.3 mm vs. 1.48 mm) and Liao et al.29 (0.3 mm vs.\n1.1 mm).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThough  the  proposed  model  achieves  desirable  results  on  both  pancreas  and  liver  datasets,  the  network\nimprovement of accuracy and application is still expected.

We introduce convolutional structure into basic segmentor, which is used as a discriminator, to\nconstruct adversarial mechanism for a higher segmentation quality. Auxiliary constraint at this moment is used\nto represent network regression condition. Furthermore, a new convolutional structure is involved into current\nframework to construct twofold adversarial mechanism. Aiming at collecting more sufficient information for\nsegmentation through imposing dual constraints on segmentor. Refined constraint at this moment is used to\nrepresent network regression condition. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets and the obtained\nresults  demonstrate  its  superior  performance  over  several  state-of-the-art  algorithms  on  pancreas  and  liver\nsegmentation tasks. This adequately indicates the proposed method is a powerful and promising tool for organ\nsegmentation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.0**t== 1.0**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nScientific Reports |         (2025) 15:2036\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.0**t== 1.0**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86087-8\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nData availability\nThe Pancreas-CT and Sliver07 datasets are publicly available, and can be downloaded using the following links:\nPancreas-CT:  https:   //wi ki.cancerimagingarch ive .net/di spl ay/ Public/P ancreas-CTSliver07:   h t t p s : / / s l i v e r 0 7 . g r a n\nd - c h a l l e n g e . o r g /     .\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.4**\nReceived: 14 September 2024; Accepted: 8 January 2025\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nReferences\n1.

         " Extracting organs of interest from medical images based on convolutional neural network with auxiliary and refined constraints   Fenghui Lian1, Yingjie Sun1 & Meiyu Li2,3   Accurately extracting organs from medical images provides radiologist with more comprehensive evidences to clinical diagnose, which offers up a higher accuracy and efficiency. However, the key to achieving accurate segmentation lies in abundant clues for contour distinction, which has a high demand for the network architecture design and its practical training status. To this end, we design auxiliary and refined constraints to optimize the energy function by supplying additional guidance in training procedure, thus promoting model’s ability to capture information. Specifically, for the auxiliary constraint, a set of convolutional structures are involved into a conventional network to act as a discriminator, then adversarial network is established. Based on the obtained architecture, we further build adversarial mechanism by introducing a second discriminator into segmentor for refinement. The involvement of refined constraint contributes to ameliorate training situation, optimize model performance, and boost its ability of collecting information for segmentation. We evaluate the proposed framework on two public databases (NIH Pancreas-CT and MICCAI Sliver07). Experimental results show that the proposed network achieves comparable performance to current pancreas segmentation algorithms and outperforms most state-of-the-art liver segmentation methods. The obtained results on public datasets sufficiently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for organ segmentation.   Keywords  Organ segmentation, Convolutional neural network, Auxiliary constraint, Refined constraint   Distinguishing organs of interest from medical images is critical to synthesis disease diagnosis or state analysis in  the  field  of  medical  imaging  analysis.  However,  multiple  organs  (i.e.  target  area  and  non-target  area)  are contained in a set of images, the boundaries between organ and background may exist indistinct phenomenon, and  the  tissues  in  morphology  and  outline  tend  to  be  variable.  All  these  factors  bring  challenge  to  accurate organ segmentation. In recent years, several medical imaging analysis methods based on neural networks are proposed for organ segmentation1–6. For example, Hu et al. firstly trained a three-dimensional convolutional neural network to predict the probability maps of target regions. Then, time-implicit multi-phase level-set is used to optimize current abdominal multi-organ segmentation model1. Chlebus et al. proposed an automatic liver tumor segmentation method based on a two-dimensional convolutional neural network, following an object- based postprocessing to refine the segmentation results2. Liu et al. raised an automatic framework to achieve organ segmentation from CT scans, where simple linear iterative clustering and support vector machine are used to roughly classify pixels, and convolutional neural network is involved to achieve precise boundary3. Ren et al. presented an interleaved three-dimensional convolutional neural network to segment small tissues of head and neck from CT images. Multiscale patches are firstly collected for more image appearance information, then the individual CNNs are interleaved to refine segmented tissues4. Huo et al. designed an automated liver attenuation estimation method, i.e., liver attenuation ROI-based measurement (ALARM). A previous deep convolutional neural network SS-Net is firstly used to segment liver. Based on liver segmentation results and morphological operations, several regions of interests are obtained to achieve attenuation estimation5.   In this paper, in order to preserve more details for segmentation, we design two sets of novel constraints (i.e. auxiliary constraintand refined constraint) on the basis of convolutional neural network to extract organs   of  interest  from  medical  images.  To  obtain  auxiliary  constraint,  we  involve  convolutional  structure  into  the conventional segmentation model, and these two parts are trained in a manner of minmax two-player game, then a novel adversarial mechanism is built. The conventional segmentation model acts as a generator while the  convolutional  structure  acts  as  a  discriminator.  This  contributes  to  enhance  the  similarity  between  the predicted segmentation maps and their corresponding ground truths. Specifically, in each training iteration, the output probability maps from generator (i.e. segmentation network) and the corresponding truths are sent into discriminator (i.e. convolutional structure). Then, the discriminator measures the nuance between the synthetic sample and the original image distributions, where auxiliary constraint is used as the performance measurement. In  the  meantime,  the  generator  starts  training  according  to  the  obtained  feedback  from  discriminator,  with the  purpose  of  synthesizing  so  authentic  samples  that  cannot  be  distinguished  from  original  images  by  the discriminator. This helps to improve the quality of the output segmentation maps.   As for the refined constraint, we further apply a set of convolutional structure into the segmentation model with auxiliary constraint to build another group of adversarial mechanism, which contributes to preservation of detailed information for segmentation. Specifically, prior to training the adversarial network with auxiliary constraint, we firstly locate the deconvolutional layer which produces the predicted maps in current network. Then,  we  further  involve  an  adversarial  mechanism  before  the  located  deconvolutional  layer.  That  is,  a  new convolutional structure is introduced as a discriminator to establish the second adversarial mechanism. At this moment, refined constraint is applied to measure the subtlety between the original and the synthetic distributions. The procedure described above is equivalent to supply two constraints on conventional segmentation model, contributing to preservation of details for segmentation. Figure 1 displays schematic illustration of the involved constraints in our proposed network.   Methods Basic segmentation architecture We employ U-Net7 to initially construct basic segmentation architecture in this work, which is an upgraded version of fully convolutional network (FCN). U-Net is primarily applied to medical image segmentation and most segmentation models apply it as baseline frame8–11. Compared to FCN, the main improvements of U-Net are  the  combined  features  from  contracting  path  and  symmetric  expanding  path,  which  contributes  to  yield more precise segmentation performance. The basic loss function is calculated as Eq. (1):   Ym  denotes  the  synthetic  samples  predicted  by  generator  while  Yg  denotes  the  corresponding  images  from original  dataset.  ω  is  the  total  number  of  volumes.  The  specific  diagram  of  basic  loss  is  displayed  in  Fig.  2. Specifically, the predicted probability maps from the fifth deconvolutional layer in basic segmentation model and their corresponding ground truths are measured by dice function, and then the Lbasic is obtained.   Fig. 1.  A schematic illustration of the proposed framework for extracting organs of interest from medical images, which includes different energy functions: Basic loss (LBasic), Auxiliary constraint (LAuxiliary), and Refined constraint (LRefined). Model 1 and Model 2 represent basic segmentation architectures with five and four deconvolutional layers, respectively. Structure 1 and Structure 2 represent the firstly and secondly involved convolutional layers which are used as discriminators, respectively.   Fig. 2.  Illustration of model architectures: deconvolutional layers (a) and (b) in segmentation frameworks Model 1 and Model 2, adversarial networks (c) and (b) which are consisted of convolutional layers. Samples from top to bottom: predicted maps from Model 1, corresponding ground truths, predicted maps from Model 2.   Auxiliary constraint for organ segmentation The generative adversarial network proposed by Goodfellow et al.12 is capable of mastering the mapping rules between input and output samples, relying on its ability to capture spatial distributions knowledge of the training samples. Generative adversarial network consists of two competing parts (i.e. generator and discriminator) and it obeys a minmax two-player game to train the network. When inputting noise z into generator, a set of fake samples will be produced. And these samples and their corresponding ground truths are used as input images to  train  discriminator,  which  can  be  regarded  as  enlarging  the  training  datasets  for  the  discriminator.  Then back  propagation  algorithm  is  involved  to  further  update  the  parameters  of  generator.  The  above  procedure is  an  iterative  process.  In  this  process,  the  ultimate  goal  of  generator  is  to  produce  samples  which  are  so authentic that the discriminator has difficulty distinguishing them from original images. The ultimate intention of discriminator is to accurately distinguish between synthetic samples and real images. The antagonistic and competitive relationship between generator and discriminator contributes to promote network performance of each other.   In  order  to  preserve  sufficient  clues  for  organ  segmentation,  we  introduce  an  auxiliary  constraint  into conventional U-Net7 to assist network training. Specifically, we involve three convolutional layers with kernels 7 × 7, 5 × 5 and 4 × 4 into conventional segmentation network, and these two structures are trained in a manner of  minmax  two-player  game,  then  adversarial  mechanism  is  obtained.  The  constructed  adversarial  learning provides  an  extra  constraint  for  basic  segmentation  model,  which  ensures  the  segmentor  training  under  the guidance of basic loss and the provided adversarial loss in each iteration process. This helps segmentor to obtain a further training and reach a steady state more quickly, thus achieving better segmentation performance. In this section, we defined the total energy function of segmentation model as auxiliary constraint. That is to say, the auxiliary constraint here performs a regression task, which consists of two items and lower values represent better performance, as shown in Eq. (2):   Dθ D (Gθ G (Y m)))   G and D represent generator and discriminator, and θG and θD respectively represent the parameters of G and D. In concrete practice process, the parameters θG are fixed when training D, while the parameters θD are fixed when training G. PG(seg) denotes the spatial distributions of the produced samples. DθD(GθG(Ym)) expresses the probability that the inputting images of D come from synthetic samples produced by G.   As  displayed  in  Fig.  2,  the  predicted  probability  maps  from  the  fifth  deconvolutional  layer  in  basic segmentation  model  and  their  corresponding  ground  truths  are  sent  into  the  adversarial  network,  which are  served  as  inputting  images  for  discriminator.  Meanwhile,  the  discriminator  emits  an  extra  constraint  for segmentation network and an adversarial regression function for itself. The basic loss from segmentation model and the extra constraint from discriminator form the novel auxiliary constraint, as displayed in Eq. (2). And the adversarial regression function for discriminator is displayed in Eq. (3):   Dθ D (Gθ G (Y m)))   − PD(ground) denotes the spatial distributions of the original dataset. DθD(Yg) expresses the probability value that its inputting images are from original dataset.   Refined constraint for organ segmentation A  second  set  of  convolutional  layers  are  involved  into  the  model  with  auxiliary  constraint,  to  further  refine network  performance  for  more  precise  details.  Specifically,  based  on  the  model  with  auxiliary  constraint, another discriminator is introduced to construct a new adversarial mechanism, which is set behind the fourth deconvolutional  layer  in  segmentor.  In  current  segmentation  model,  the  energy  function  from  conventional network rules supreme compared with the involved adversarial constraints. This scheme gives the flexibility to use the specific competing relationship in GAN, which involves two constraints into segmentor to refine energy function, thus improve information preservation capacity to boost segmentation performance. The second set of convolutional layers in this part is identical to the discriminator in model with auxiliary constraint described in “Auxiliary constraint for organ segmentation”.   As shown in Fig.  2, on basis of the  model with auxiliary constraint, the predicted probability  maps from the fourth deconvolutional layer in basic segmentation model and their ground truths are measured by dice function,  and  then  a  second  basic  loss  corresponding  to  current  segmentor  is  obtained.  Then,  the  predicted probability maps from the fourth deconvolutional layer and their corresponding ground truths are used as the inputting images for an adversarial network. Thus, an extra constraint for current segmentation network and a  new  adversarial  regression  function  for  this  adversarial  network  are  obtained.  The  refined  constraint  here performs a regression task, and it consists of four items, as shown in Eq. (4):   According to the primary and secondary relations of various factors affecting segmentation performance, the items of ω1, ω2, ω3, and ω4 in Eq. (4) are set to 1, 0.001, 0.1, and 0.0002, respectively.   The regression functions for discriminators are respectively displayed in Eqs. (5) and (6):   Results Dataset and evaluation metrics We involve two public datasets in this work to test model performance, including pancreas database collected by  National  Institutes  of  Health  Clinical  Center13,14  and  Sliver07  provided  by  MICCAI  liver  segmentation competition15. The pancreas dataset consists of 82 contrast-enhanced CT volumes, and the size of each slice is 512 × 512. According to the training mode in16–20, we employ 4-fold cross validation to spit the dataset in this work. The Sliver07 contains 20 contrast-enhanced volumes with standard truths, and the size of each slice is 512 × 512.   There  are  two  groups  of  metrics  are  applied  for  segmentation  evaluation  in  this  work,  including  error measurement and similarity measurement. The error measurement consists of six indexes: Volumetric Overlap Error (VOE), Relative Volume Difference (VD), Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASD), Root Mean Square Symmetric Surface Distance (RMSD), Maximum Symmetric Surface Distance (MSD) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The similarity measurement consists of four indexes: Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Precision, Recall and Jaccard. All experiments are carried on PyTorch environment and run on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti GPU of 11 GB memory.   Segmentation results on NIH dataset Figure 3 shows error measurement distributions on NIH pancreas dataset from models with basic loss, auxiliary constraint and refined constraint, including metrics VOE, VD, ASD, RMSD, MSD and RMSE. Whereas Fig. 4 shows  similarity  measurement  distributions  of  DSC,  Precision,  Recall  and  Jaccard  from  these  three  models. Figures  3  and  4  intuitively  display  segmentation  result  distributions  from  different  models  on  NIH  pancreas dataset, and the specific values of these ten sets of metrics are correspondingly shown in Table 1. Furthermore, Fig. 5 displays five groups of predicted maps from these three models to observe segmentation performance in an intuitive mode.   Fig. 3.

In  order  to  intuitively  exhibit  the  liver segmentation results, we display the output probability maps in Fig. 8.   Discussion Segmentation results on NIH dataset For error measurement, lower values equate to better segmentation performance in figures showing quantitative comparisons. It is obvious from Fig. 3 that the obtained error measurement from model with refined constraint represent strongest convergence in each indicator, compared with models with basic loss and auxiliary constraint. This indicates the involvement of refined constraint contributes to a more stable pancreas segmentation state. It   Fig. 5.

Table 2.  Evaluation indicators for liver segmentation on sliver dataset.   also can be seen from Fig. 3 that the average level of each index corresponding to model with refined constraint show optimal state. This illustrates the application of refined constraint improves the model performance, which also effectively demonstrates its validity for pancreas segmentation.   For  similarity  measurement,  higher  values  equate  to  better  segmentation  performance.  As  displayed  in Fig. 4, the obtained similarity measurement from model with refined constraint show strongest convergence than another two models. This indicates the introduction of refined constraint improves the liver segmentation stability.  It  also  can  be  observed  from  Fig.  4  that  the  mean  values  of  each  measurement  corresponding  to model  with  refined  constraint  show  optimal  level. This  indicates  refined  constraint  effectively  improves  liver segmentation performance, confirming the effectiveness of refined constraint for organ segmentation.   As  displayed  in  Table  1,  mean  and  standard  deviation  (std)  of  VOE  for  models  with  basic  loss,  auxiliary constraint and refined constraint are 36.3 ± 9.5, 32.5 ± 8.6 and 29.0 ± 7.4, while mean and std of ASD for these three models are 1.0 ± 0.8, 0.7 ± 0.5 and 0.5 ± 0.4. From these error measurement on pancreas dataset, we can conclude that the involvement of refined constraint achieves an optimized VOE of 7.3% and ASD of 0.5 mm, which  strongly  suggests  its  profit  for  boosting  segmentation  quality.  Furthermore,  the  depressed  std  values illustrates the model performance gradually stabilized. Besides, the obtained results of DSC and Precision are 77.4 ± 7.6, 80.3 ± 6.4, 82.8 ± 5.3, 77.6 ± 9.7, 79.9 ± 9.6 and 83.1 ± 7.9, consecutively. This further demonstrates the improved maps quality and stabilized model performance. It can be observed from Fig. 5 that the predicted probability maps from basic model tend  to  represent  chunks of deviations,  and the involvement of auxiliary constraint ameliorates the situation. After this, refined constraint further improves segmentation performance even in tiny positions which are difficult to segment.   Segmentation results on Sliver07 dataset As shown in Fig. 6, the mean level of each metric box uniformly progressively decreased from (a) model with basic loss, (b) model with auxiliary constraint to (c) model with refined constraint. This declares the contribution of auxiliary constraint and refined constraint on promoting liver segmentation capability. Meanwhile, the mean level  of  each  box  in  Fig.  7  progressively  increased  from  (a)  basic  loss,  (b)  auxiliary  constraint  to  (c)  refined constraint, which further verifies the effectiveness of the involved auxiliary and refined l constraints. Table 2 displays mean and std of metrics for liver segmentation models with basic loss, auxiliary constraint and refined constraint. Their corresponding VOE values are 19.6 ± 3.2, 12.3 ± 3.1 and 7.2 ± 2.2 while ASD values are 1.8 ± 0.9, 0.7 ± 0.4 and 0.3 ± 0.2. Besides, the obtained liver segmentation results of DSC and Jaccard are 89.1 ± 2.0, 93.4 ± 1.7, 96.3 ± 1.2, 80.4 ± 3.2, 87.7 ± 3.1 and 92.8 ± 2.2, consecutively. The predicted segmentation maps are displayed in Fig. 8, it is obvious that the output maps from model with auxiliary constraint can deal better with main  frame  areas  than  basic  loss.  Furthermore,  the  employment  of  refined  constraint  helps  to  polish  minor positions which are challengeable to distinguish from background in other two models.   Fig. 8.

Comparison to state-of-the-art Our  proposed  model  is  compared  with  the-state-of-art  pancreas  segmentation  methods  to  test  its performance6,17–24. As can be shown in Table 3, the model with refined constraint achieves improvements with DSC of 0.47% (82.8% vs. 82.33%), Precision of 0.98% (83.1% vs. 82.12%) and Jaccard of 4.45% (74.8% vs. 70.35%)   Table 3.  Comparison with the state-of-the-arts models for pancreas segmentation.   Table 4.  Comparison with the state-of-the-arts models for liver segmentation.   compared to Li et al.21. The mean DSC increases 1.53% (82.8% vs. 81.27%) and 0.4% (82.8% vs. 82.4%) compared to Roth et al.19 and Cai et al.22 and their Jaccard respectively increases 5.93% (74.8% vs. 68.87%) and 4.2% (74.8% vs. 70.6%). The DSC score of methods Liu et al.23 and Cai et al.24 are respectively 1.30% (82.8% vs. 84.10%) and 0.90% (82.8% vs. 83.70%) higher than the proposed model with refined constraint. While its obtained Jaccard optimizes 1.94% and 2.50% compared to Liu et al.23 (74.8% vs. 72.86%) and Cai et al.24 (74.8% vs. 72.30%). It can be observed that our proposed model exceeds most current technologies from different evaluation metrics. The comparison in Table 4 shows our proposed model exceeds most liver segmentation methods3,25–30. The proposed model with refined constraint achieves the best liver segmentation performance with a mean DSC of 96.3%. The obtained RMSD optimizes 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm respectively compared to Wu et al.26 (2.3 mm vs. 2.5 mm) and Gauriau et al.27 (2.3 mm vs. 2.6 mm). The obtained ASD optimizes 0.93 mm, 0.99 mm and 1.00 mm compared to Wang et al.28 (0.3 mm vs. 1.23 mm), Wu et al.26 (0.3 mm vs. 1.29 mm) and Gauriau et al.27 (0.3 mm vs. 1.3 mm). Meanwhile, the obtained VOE optimizes 0.37% and 0.67% compared to Wang et al.28 (7.2% vs. 7.57%) and Wu et al.26 (7.2% vs. 7.87%). The DSC score of methods Liu et al.3 and Liao et al.29 are respectively 1.13%  (96.3%  vs.  97.43%)  and  0.9%  (96.3%  vs.  97.2%)  higher  than  our  proposed  model.  While  its  obtained ASD optimizes 1.18 mm and 0.8 mm compared to Liu et al.3 (0.3 mm vs. 1.48 mm) and Liao et al.29 (0.3 mm vs. 1.1 mm).   Though  the  proposed  model  achieves  desirable  results  on  both  pancreas  and  liver  datasets,  the  network improvement of accuracy and application is still expected. Future research will fine-tune current architecture to cope better with pancreas and liver segmentation. Also, future work will apply the proposed model on multiple datasets to explore the latent potential to solve different organ segmentation tasks. In addition, we intend to conduct  the  existing  model  on  medical  imaging  materials  collected  from  clinical  application,  to  explore  its potential ability of addressing the clinical scenario.   Conclusion This paper designs a convolutional neural network with auxiliary and refined constraints to segment organs from medical image. We introduce convolutional structure into basic segmentor, which is used as a discriminator, to construct adversarial mechanism for a higher segmentation quality. Auxiliary constraint at this moment is used to represent network regression condition. Furthermore, a new convolutional structure is involved into current framework to construct twofold adversarial mechanism. Aiming at collecting more sufficient information for segmentation through imposing dual constraints on segmentor. Refined constraint at this moment is used to represent network regression condition. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets and the obtained results  demonstrate  its  superior  performance  over  several  state-of-the-art  algorithms  on  pancreas  and  liver segmentation tasks. This adequately indicates the proposed method is a powerful and promising tool for organ segmentation.

While it has been observed in various sources, its detection in Sgr B2 is notable as the 2$_{11}$-2$_{12}$ rotational transition exhibits maser features. This indicates that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are not fulfilled, and an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance in such conditions involves solving the statistical equilibrium equations taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes. This in turn requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first three-dimensional CH$_2$CHCN - He potential energy surface is computed using explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [(CCSD(T)-F12] with a combination of two basis sets. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_2$CHCN induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum-mechanical close-coupling method in the low-energy regime. Rotational state-to-state cross sections derived from these calculations are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients. The interaction potential exhibits a high anisotropy, with a global minimum of $-53.5$ cm$^{-1}$ and multiple local minima. Collisional cross sections are calculated for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the cross-sections, collisional rate coefficients are determined for temperatures up to 20 K.

COMs pos-\nsess varying complexity and chemical compo-\nsition: both saturated and unsaturated COMs\ncontaining oxygen, nitrogen and/or sulfur have\nbeen detected.\nSuch omnipresence suggests\nthat their studies will lead to a better under-\nstanding of stellar evolution and formation of\nplanetary systems. 2 However, radioastronomi-\ncal detections are hindered for molecular species\nwith small or zero dipole moments. 3 Nitriles\nand other highly polar N-containing molecules\nare therefore among the most observed COM\nspecies via their rotational spectrum.\nVinyl cyanide (or acrylonitrile, CH2CHCN) is\nthe first olefinic nitrile detected in space. 4–6\nNitriles are systems of prebiotic importance,\nconsidered among other C-N bond-bearing\nfor\nmolecules\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nto be potential precursors\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\naminoacids and nucleobases. 7 While vinyl\ncyanide itself is regarded as a candidate for\ncell-like membrane formation in anoxygenic\nenvironments, 8 its olefinic nature also brings\ninto light its terrestrial chemistry:\nit is prone\nto polymerisation and is very reactive overall.\nVinyl cyanide was initially detected in space\nin Sgr B2 through its 211-212 transition at 1.37\nGHz, which displays maser features that in-\ndicate that local thermodynamic equilibrium\nconditions (LTE) are not fulfilled. 4 Moreover,\nvinyl cyanide was also detected in the dense\ndark Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC-1). 5 The\nauthors report a column density of 3×1012 cm−2\nusing an excitation temperature Tex = 5 K as-\nsuming LTE conditions. Such an assumption\nis made since the hyperfine components have\nintensity ratios matching the ones expected in\nLTE. Furthermore, vinyl cyanide was observed\nin IRC +10216 with transitions involving levels\nup to j = 11. 6 Vinyl cyanide was also detected\nin Titan’s atmosphere 9 and in Orion KL in its\nground and vibrationally excited states. 10\nChemical models utilizing large networks of\nelementary chemical and physical interstellar\nprocesses are employed as a means to improve\nour understanding of molecular evolution in\nspace. 11 Accordingly, a combined experimental\nand theoretical effort is needed to provide the\ndata necessary for modelling. The formation of\nVinyl cyanide was investigated experimentally\nvia crossed beam approach, 12 and a possible\nformation path in the interstellar medium is\nthrough a barrierless neutral-neutral reaction:\nC2H4(X 1Ag) + CN(X 2Σ+).\nIt was also re-\nported that this reaction path is preferable\nto the one leading to the CH2CHNC isomer.\nThese results were later confirmed through a\ntheoretical investigation by an RRKM-master\nequation analysis. 13 Additionally, vinyl cyanide\ncan be involved in further reactions with CN\nradicals to form more complex nitriles through\nsimilar barrierless fast reactions. 14\nDetermining the abundances of molecular\nspecies in interstellar environments can be a\nchallenging task as LTE conditions do not\nnecessarily hold.\nInstead, one has to assume\nnon-LTE excitation where the population of\nmolecular levels is determined by the compe-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ntition between radiative and collisional pro-\ncesses. In this case, the accurate estimation of\nmolecular abundances requires the knowledge\nof precise collisional excitation rate coefficients\nwith the most abundant interstellar species (H2\nand He). However, the collisional properties of\nthe majority of COMs remain unknown. The\nincreasing size of the systems presents compu-\ntational challenges due to the strong anisotropy\nof the potential energy surface (PES) and the\nlarge number of rotational levels that can be\npopulated at low energy. Collisional studies for\nCOMs-H2 are especially demanding, 15–18 and\nHe is often used as a proxy for para-H2 (j = 0),\nsince both are spherical, while the mass differ-\nence is taken into account by scaling the rate\ncoefficients. 19–22\nIn this paper we present cross sections and rate\ncoefficients for the collisional rotational (de-\n)excitation of the vinyl cyanide with He atoms\nbased on a newly developed potential energy\nsurface and fully quantum scattering calcula-\ntions.\nIn section 2 we present the ab initio\nstudy of the CH2CHCN - He system and the\nconstruction of the underlying PES, obtained\nwith the coupled cluster method using a combi-\nnation of two basis sets. In section 3 we report\nthe quantum dynamics study of these collisions\nand discuss the resulting inelastic scattering\ncross sections at low energy. The correspond-\ning (de-)excitation rate coefficients are derived\nfor kinetic temperatures up to 20 K based on\nthe quantum scattering calculations and pre-\nsented in section 3.3.

The coordinate sys-\ntem used for the CH2CHCN interaction with\nhelium is presented in Figure 1. The origin of\nthe axes is the mass centre of vinyl cyanide,\nwhile the vinyl cyanide molecule is oriented in\nits principal axis frame. The molecule is pla-\nnar and lies in the xz plane. The interaction\nwith helium is defined by three intermolecular\ncoordinates: R, θ, ϕ. R is the magnitude of\nthe vector R that connects the centre of mass\nof the vinyl cyanide molecule and the helium\natom, it represents the distance between the\ntwo colliding partners. θ is the polar angle be-\ntween the vector R and the axis z, aligned with\nthe principal inertia axis a of vinyl cyanide,\nwhile ϕ is the azimuthal angle.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFigure 1: Jacobi coordinate system for the\nCH2CHCN-He complex.

For several\nfixed orientations of the He atom with respect\nto the vinyl cyanide molecule, we performed a\ncomparison using a standard CCSD(T) 27 and\nexplicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12a method\nwith single, double, and perturbative triple\nexcitations. 28 Here we used the augmented\ncorrelation-consistent basis sets developed by\nDunning et al. 29 For CCSD(T) calculations the\naug-cc-pVnZ (aVnZ for short), n = T,Q,5 ba-\nsis sets were used, while for CCSD(T)-F12a\nwe limited calculations to aVnZ, n=D,T ba-\nsis sets. Figure 2 displays potential energy\ncuts for two geometries from the chosen set\nof orientations. These plots demonstrate the\nusual behaviour for the CCSD(T)/aVnZ series:\nthe correlation-consistent basis sets lead to a\ndeeper potential well for the increasing basis\nsize and converge toward a basis set limit. On\nthe other hand, the CCSD(T)-F12a/aVnZ se-\nries provides near identical results for all three\ntested basis sets (n=D, T, Q) but does not\ndemonstrate consequent convergence. In some\ncases (panel a) it also overestimates the corre-\nlation energies. This is a known behaviour as-\nsociated with these explicitly correlated meth-\nods. 28 Considering that CCSD(T)-F12a/aVnZ,\nn = D,T calculations provide the closest results\nto the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z values and that\nthe results obtained with these two methods are\nalmost the same, a combination of the two was\nchosen to perform the full PES calculations,\nas detailed below.

The final expansion of the po-\ntential V sum was performed with the param-\neters lmax = 16, mmax = 15. To assess the\nquality of the obtained potential we performed\nan additional quality test: a set of 75 ran-\ndomized ab initio points were calculated at the\nCCSD(T)-F12/aVTZ level of theory. The re-\nsulting accuracy of the fitting procedure was\nbetter than 1 cm−1 for the attractive part of\nthe PES.\nThe calculation of molecule-helium interaction\npotentials presents a complication of impor-\ntance in the framework of collisional studies:\nthe long-range part of the potential (R ≥ 8 ˚A)\nusually demonstrates oscillations with an am-\nplitude of up to 0.1 cm−1.

The two\nlocal minima are separated by a barrier of 28.5\ncm−1.\nInterestingly, when the He atom is located in\nthe molecular plane the local minimum only dif-\nfers from the global minimum by 0.6 cm−1. The\nenergy of the minimum of the PES for fixed ϕ\ndecreases from −44.6 cm−1 for ϕ = 0 to −53.5\ncm−1 for ϕ = 51◦ before increasing to −47.1\ncm−1 for ϕ = 90◦.

The illustrated cross sec-\ntions all demonstrate similar features at low ener-\ngies: a dense structure of resonances is observed for\nE ≤ 25 cm−1 due to the formation of a quasi-bound\ncollisional complex caused by the presence of the\nattractive potential well of -53.47 cm−1. Outside\nthe resonant region, the cross sections gradually\ndecrease as the collision energy increases.\nFor collision energies above 10 cm−1, we observe a\nclear propensity rule favoring the pair of transitions\n312 – 212 and 312 – 110. This corresponds to transi-\ntions with ∆j = 1, ∆ka = 0, ∆kc = 0 and ∆j = 2\n∆, ka = 0, ∆kc = 2, respectively. The largest cross\nsections are systematically observed for such tran-\nsitions involving other initial rotational levels. We\nalso note that both these types of dominating tran-\nsitions have cross sections that are almost identical\nover the energy range considered here.

Panels (a) and\n(b) demonstrate a strong propensity rule favour-\ning transitions with ∆ka = 0 ∆kc = 2. Here, the\nlargest cross sections correspond to the transitions\n211 – 110, 322 – 220, 432 – 330 for ∆j = 1 and 313 –\n111, 414 – 212, 515 – 313 for ∆j = 2.\nInterestingly,\nthe transitions for ∆j = 1 and ∆j = 2 are sim-\nilar, although the expansion term v20 outweighs\nthe term v10, as discussed above. Other propen-\nsity rules are not as prominent, as can be seen on\npanels (c) and (d), where ∆j and ∆ka propensi-\nties are illustrated. The clearest trend is thus a\npropensity rule favoring ∆ka = 0 transitions. This\nimplies a conservation of the angular momentum\nalong the a-axis, which corresponds to the small-\nest moment of inertia. Such propensity rules were\nalready observed for the rotational excitation of\nother COMs such as propylene oxide in collisions\nwith He atoms. 20\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFigure 6: Kinetic energy dependence of the ro-\ntational quenching cross-sections σj′k′\nc←jkakc\nof CH2CHCN-He system from the 312 initial\nstate.\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.3**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n3.3 Rate coefficients\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFrom state-to-state cross sections calculated for to-\ntal energies up to 100 cm−1 we computed the corre-\nsponding rate coefficients for transitions involving\nthe lowest rotational levels for kinetic temperatures\nbetween 5 and 20 K by averaging the cross sections\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 7: Kinetic energy dependence of the rotational quenching cross sections σj′k′\nc←jkakc of\nCH2CHCN-He system for ∆j = 1, ∆ka = 0 and ∆kc = 1 or 2 (panel a); ∆j = 2, ∆ka = 0 and\n∆kc = 1 or 2 (panel b); ∆j = 1 or 2, ∆ka = 0, and ∆kc = 1 (panel c); and for ∆j = 2, ∆ka = 1 or\n2, ∆kc = 0 (panel d).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nover a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.5**\nEkσi→f (Ek)e−βEk dEk\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n(7)\nwhere β=1/kBT and kB, T and µ are the Boltz-\nmann constant, the kinetic temperature and the\ncollision reduced mass respectively.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe quenching rate coefficients of CH2CHCN\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFigure 8: Temperature dependence of the ro-\ntational quenching rate coefficients j′k′\nc ←\njkakc of CH2CHCN in collision with He atoms\nfor ∆j = 1 ∆ka = 0 and ∆kc = 1 and 2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nin collision with He are illustrated as a function\nof kinetic temperature in Figure 8 for ∆j = 1,\n∆ka = 0, and ∆kc = 1 or 2 transitions.

The global minimum of the PES was\nfound at ϕ = 51◦, θ = 89◦, R = 3.3 ˚A with a cor-\nresponding potential well depths of −53.5 cm−1.\nSeveral local minima were also found, notably at\nthe geometry ϕ = 180◦, θ = 69◦, R = 3.6 ˚A,\nwith an energy of −52.9 cm−1, only 0.6 cm−1 above\nthe global minimum. The interaction potential is\nhighly anisotropic in the θ coordinate with several\nlocal minima separated by barriers. On the other\nhand, the features of the PES suggest the almost\nfree movement of the He atom along the ϕ coordi-\nnate.\nThe PES was employed to perform quantum\nscattering calculations and compute the state-to-\nstate rotationally inelastic cross sections using the\nquantum-mechanical close-coupling method. Rota-\ntional cross sections were calculated as a function\nof the total energy up to 100 cm−1. By thermally\naveraging the result over the Maxwell–Boltzmann\ndistribution, the state-to-state rotational rate co-\nefficients were obtained for temperatures up to\n20 K. Propensity rules favouring transitions with\n∆ka = 0 were observed, while other transitions do\nnot demonstrate obvious trends.\nA further step will be the assessment of the im-\npact of collisional excitation on vinyl cyanide spec-\ntra using the obtained rate coefficients in radia-\ntive transfer models. This is likely to be impor-\ntant since vinyl cyanide was originally detected as\na maser, likely due to the collisional effects. Non-\nLTE modeling accounting for the competition be-\ntween the radiative and collisional processes would\nalso allow to better constrain the abundance of\nthese molecules in various astronomical environ-\nments and further our understanding of the non-\nLTE effects. However, this will require extending\nthe present calculations to higher rotational levels\nand kinetic temperatures. Finally, we should note\nthat while He is often used as a proxy to model the\ncollisional excitation by para-H2 molecules, this ap-\nproximation does not necessarily hold, 40 so that\nstudying the excitation of vinyl cyanide by H2\ncould also be investigated in future work.\n**BLOCK**fs== 17.2**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n5 Acknowledgments\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nJL acknowledges support from KU Leuven through\nProject no.

         " Rotational Excitation of Vinyl Cyanide by Collisions with Helium Atoms at Low Temperature   Karina Sogomonyan,∗ Malek Ben Khalifa, and J´erˆome Loreau∗   KU Leuven, Department of Chemistry, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.   E-mail: karina.sogomonyan@kuleuven.be; jerome.loreau@kuleuven.be   Among the numerous molecular systems found in the interstellar medium (ISM), vinyl cyanide is the first identified olephinic nitrile. While it has been observed in various sources, its detection in Sgr B2 is notable as the 211-212 rotational transition exhibits maser features. This indicates that local thermodynamic equi- librium conditions are not fulfilled, and an ac- curate estimation of the molecular abundance in such conditions involves solving the statis- tical equilibrium equations taking into account the competition between the radiative and col- lisional processes. This in turn requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for col- lisions with the most abundant species - He or H2. In this paper the first three-dimensional CH2CHCN - He potential energy surface is computed using explicitly correlated coupled- cluster theory [(CCSD(T)-F12] with a combi- nation of two basis sets. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of CH2CHCN induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum-mechanical close-coupling method in the low-energy regime. Rotational state-to- state cross sections derived from these calcu- lations are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients. The interaction potential ex- hibits a high anisotropy, with a global minimum of −53.5 cm−1 and multiple local minima. Col- lisional cross sections are calculated for total energies up to 100 cm−1. By thermally aver- aging the cross-sections, collisional rate coeffi-   cients are determined for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favouring the transitions with ∆ka = 0 is observed.   Over the past decades, molecules of increas- ing complexity have been discovered in vari- ous astronomical environments, with a rapid acceleration in molecular detections in recent years. Among those, the interstellar complex organic molecules (small organic molecules with 6 atoms or more) often denoted as COMs com- prise a considerable part. 1 They have been ob- served in star-forming regions, as well as in dif- fuse and dense interstellar clouds. COMs pos- sess varying complexity and chemical compo- sition: both saturated and unsaturated COMs containing oxygen, nitrogen and/or sulfur have been detected. Such omnipresence suggests that their studies will lead to a better under- standing of stellar evolution and formation of planetary systems. 2 However, radioastronomi- cal detections are hindered for molecular species with small or zero dipole moments. 3 Nitriles and other highly polar N-containing molecules are therefore among the most observed COM species via their rotational spectrum. Vinyl cyanide (or acrylonitrile, CH2CHCN) is the first olefinic nitrile detected in space. 4–6 Nitriles are systems of prebiotic importance, considered among other C-N bond-bearing for molecules   to be potential precursors   aminoacids and nucleobases. 7 While vinyl cyanide itself is regarded as a candidate for cell-like membrane formation in anoxygenic environments, 8 its olefinic nature also brings into light its terrestrial chemistry: it is prone to polymerisation and is very reactive overall. Vinyl cyanide was initially detected in space in Sgr B2 through its 211-212 transition at 1.37 GHz, which displays maser features that in- dicate that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions (LTE) are not fulfilled. 4 Moreover, vinyl cyanide was also detected in the dense dark Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC-1). 5 The authors report a column density of 3×1012 cm−2 using an excitation temperature Tex = 5 K as- suming LTE conditions. Such an assumption is made since the hyperfine components have intensity ratios matching the ones expected in LTE. Furthermore, vinyl cyanide was observed in IRC +10216 with transitions involving levels up to j = 11. 6 Vinyl cyanide was also detected in Titan’s atmosphere 9 and in Orion KL in its ground and vibrationally excited states. 10 Chemical models utilizing large networks of elementary chemical and physical interstellar processes are employed as a means to improve our understanding of molecular evolution in space. 11 Accordingly, a combined experimental and theoretical effort is needed to provide the data necessary for modelling. The formation of Vinyl cyanide was investigated experimentally via crossed beam approach, 12 and a possible formation path in the interstellar medium is through a barrierless neutral-neutral reaction: C2H4(X 1Ag) + CN(X 2Σ+). It was also re- ported that this reaction path is preferable to the one leading to the CH2CHNC isomer. These results were later confirmed through a theoretical investigation by an RRKM-master equation analysis. 13 Additionally, vinyl cyanide can be involved in further reactions with CN radicals to form more complex nitriles through similar barrierless fast reactions. 14 Determining the abundances of molecular species in interstellar environments can be a challenging task as LTE conditions do not necessarily hold. Instead, one has to assume non-LTE excitation where the population of molecular levels is determined by the compe-   tition between radiative and collisional pro- cesses. In this case, the accurate estimation of molecular abundances requires the knowledge of precise collisional excitation rate coefficients with the most abundant interstellar species (H2 and He). However, the collisional properties of the majority of COMs remain unknown. The increasing size of the systems presents compu- tational challenges due to the strong anisotropy of the potential energy surface (PES) and the large number of rotational levels that can be populated at low energy. Collisional studies for COMs-H2 are especially demanding, 15–18 and He is often used as a proxy for para-H2 (j = 0), since both are spherical, while the mass differ- ence is taken into account by scaling the rate coefficients. 19–22 In this paper we present cross sections and rate coefficients for the collisional rotational (de- )excitation of the vinyl cyanide with He atoms based on a newly developed potential energy surface and fully quantum scattering calcula- tions. In section 2 we present the ab initio study of the CH2CHCN - He system and the construction of the underlying PES, obtained with the coupled cluster method using a combi- nation of two basis sets. In section 3 we report the quantum dynamics study of these collisions and discuss the resulting inelastic scattering cross sections at low energy. The correspond- ing (de-)excitation rate coefficients are derived for kinetic temperatures up to 20 K based on the quantum scattering calculations and pre- sented in section 3.3. Conclusions and outlooks are discussed in section 4.   2 Potential energy surface   Our first aim is to investigate the interac- tion between the asymmetric top molecule CH2CHCN and a helium atom in their re- spective ground electronic states. The lowest vibrational mode for vinyl cyanide is v = 242 cm−1. 23 For high-energy collisions the first vi- brational mode should be taken into account while constructing the PES, whereas for low-   internal   temperature environments of ISM, a rigid rotor approximation can be applied. The geometry parameters determined from the experimental rotational spectra of vinyl cyanide 24 were used as coordi- r(C1≡N2) = 1.164 ˚A, r(C1–C3) = nates: 1.426 ˚A, r(C3=C5) = 1.339 ˚A, r(C5–H6) = 1.088 ˚A, r(C5–H7) = 1.088 ˚A, r(C3–H4) = 1.086 ˚A, ̸ (C1C3C5) = 122.6◦, ̸ (H4C3C5) = 121.7◦,̸ (C3C1N2) = 180◦. The coordinate sys- tem used for the CH2CHCN interaction with helium is presented in Figure 1. The origin of the axes is the mass centre of vinyl cyanide, while the vinyl cyanide molecule is oriented in its principal axis frame. The molecule is pla- nar and lies in the xz plane. The interaction with helium is defined by three intermolecular coordinates: R, θ, ϕ. R is the magnitude of the vector R that connects the centre of mass of the vinyl cyanide molecule and the helium atom, it represents the distance between the two colliding partners. θ is the polar angle be- tween the vector R and the axis z, aligned with the principal inertia axis a of vinyl cyanide, while ϕ is the azimuthal angle.   Figure 1: Jacobi coordinate system for the CH2CHCN-He complex. The coordinate sys- in the centre of mass of tem origin is CH2CHCN. The molecule lies in the xz plane.   Boys and Bernardi 26 was taken into account to compute the ab initio interaction energy:   V (R, θ, ϕ) = VMol−He(R, θ, ϕ)−VMol(R, θ, ϕ)−VHe(R, θ, ϕ)   (1) To find a suitable method for the construc- tion of the full PES, a set of test potential en- ergy surface cuts was calculated. For several fixed orientations of the He atom with respect to the vinyl cyanide molecule, we performed a comparison using a standard CCSD(T) 27 and explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12a method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. 28 Here we used the augmented correlation-consistent basis sets developed by Dunning et al. 29 For CCSD(T) calculations the aug-cc-pVnZ (aVnZ for short), n = T,Q,5 ba- sis sets were used, while for CCSD(T)-F12a we limited calculations to aVnZ, n=D,T ba- sis sets. Figure 2 displays potential energy cuts for two geometries from the chosen set of orientations. These plots demonstrate the usual behaviour for the CCSD(T)/aVnZ series: the correlation-consistent basis sets lead to a deeper potential well for the increasing basis size and converge toward a basis set limit. On the other hand, the CCSD(T)-F12a/aVnZ se- ries provides near identical results for all three tested basis sets (n=D, T, Q) but does not demonstrate consequent convergence. In some cases (panel a) it also overestimates the corre- lation energies. This is a known behaviour as- sociated with these explicitly correlated meth- ods. 28 Considering that CCSD(T)-F12a/aVnZ, n = D,T calculations provide the closest results to the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z values and that the results obtained with these two methods are almost the same, a combination of the two was chosen to perform the full PES calculations, as detailed below. This will provide an accu- rate PES while considerably reducing the CPU times and disk space.   2.2 Computational methods   The ab initio calculations were carried out with the MOLPRO (version 2020.2) program pack- age. 25 The counterpoise correction procedure of   The construction of a precise potential energy surface consisted of several parts: ab initio calculations of the interaction energies with CCSD(T)-F12a/aVnZ, n = D,T methods, their   respective fitting, and the merging of the two analytical fits to obtain the radial coefficients used in scattering calculations. Quantum scat- tering calculations require an expansion of the angular dependence of the PES over spherical harmonics. In terms of the spherical coordi- nates (R, θ, ϕ) this expansion can be written as:   vlm(R)Y m   or alternatively, considering the properties of the spherical harmonics, as:   (3) where vlm(R) and Y m l (θ, ϕ) are the radial co- efficients to be computed and the normalised spherical harmonics respectively, and δm,0 is the Kronecker symbol. From the PES parametrised by R, θ, and ϕ, we obtain continuous radial co- efficients vlm(R) through a least-squares fit for each value of the integers l and m. For ev- ery analytical fitting procedure, we adjust the parameters lmax and mmax to ensure an accu- rate representation of the potential while lim- iting the CPU time increase in the scattering calculations. The full procedure to the PES was as fol- lows. In a first step, we compute a dense grid of ab initio points with the lower accuracy method (CCSD(T)-F12a/aVDZ). We then per- form the analytical fitting procedure, leading to the radial coefficients denoted as vDZ lm . The analytical potential that can be reconstructed lm coefficients is denoted as V DZ. from the vDZ In a second step, we compute ab initio ener- gies with a higher accuracy method (CCSD(T)- F12a/aVTZ) on a sparser grid and we perform the analytical fitting procedure for this reduced PES. Since the number of angles considered will be smaller, the parameters lmax and mmax in Eq. (3) are smaller than for V DZ. The resulting ra- dial coefficients are denoted as vTZ,red and the reconstructed analytical potential is denoted as V TZ,red. We then obtain a fit of the DZ en-   Figure 2: Potential energy cuts (cm−1) for the CH2CHCN - He complex calculated at different levels of theory as a function of R for ϕ = 90◦, θ = 90◦ (panel a) and ϕ = 0◦, θ = 16.11◦ (panel b).   ergies on the same coarser grid and with the same expansion parameters as for the V TZ,red potential. The resulting radial coefficients are denoted as vDZ,red and the reconstructed po- tential as V DZ,red. In a third step, we cal- culate the difference of the radial coefficients with matching l and m parameters for every R: vTZ,red = vdiff lm . We can then con- lm struct the analytical potential V diff from the co- lm and add this potential to the V DZ efficients vdiff potential, V DZ + V diff = V sum. This potential is supposed to match the quality of the full PES performed with CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ. Finally, V sum can be expanded with Eq.(3) to obtain the resulting vsum lm radial coefficients that are used for the scattering calculations.   2.4 Ab initio calculations   V DZ was constructed from 50,616 ab initio en- ergies. The geometries were chosen for 72 in- termolecular distances from 2.0 to 100.0 ˚A, 37 values of θ ranging between [0-180◦] by steps of 5◦ and 19 values of ϕ in the range [0-180◦] by steps of 10◦. This large number of points was found to be necessary to obtain an accu- rate analytical potential V DZ due to the strong anisotropy. V TZ,red was constructed from 8,029 ab initio points in total. These were chosen for 31 intermolecular distances from 2.0 to 100.0 ˚A, 37 values of θ ranging between [0-180◦] by steps of 5◦ and 7 values of ϕ in the range [0-180◦] by steps of 30◦. A dense grid in θ was chosen be- cause preliminary tests of the fitting algorithm showed that sparser grids systematically led to spurious features in the fitted potential. This reflects the large anisotropy in θ, further dis- cussed in the next sections. Due to the inclusion of perturbative triple exci- tations, the explicitly-correlated CCSD(T)-F12 methods are not size consistent. 30 For every fixed angular orientation the asymptotic value of the potential was subtracted from the inter- action energies.   2.5 Analytical fits   V DZ is constructed from a grid containing 37 values of θ and 19 values of ϕ, from which   we were able to obtain radial coefficients up to lmax = 16 mmax = 15, resulting in 152 ex- pansion terms. V TZ,red is obtained on a grid containing 37 values of θ and 7 values of ϕ, from which radial coefficients up to lmax = 16 mmax = 6 were calculated, resulting in 98 expansion terms. The reduced reconstructed potential V DZ,red was obtained through fitting of the aVDZ energies over the same grid as for V TZ,red. The final expansion of the po- tential V sum was performed with the param- eters lmax = 16, mmax = 15. To assess the quality of the obtained potential we performed an additional quality test: a set of 75 ran- domized ab initio points were calculated at the CCSD(T)-F12/aVTZ level of theory. The re- sulting accuracy of the fitting procedure was better than 1 cm−1 for the attractive part of the PES. The calculation of molecule-helium interaction potentials presents a complication of impor- tance in the framework of collisional studies: the long-range part of the potential (R ≥ 8 ˚A) usually demonstrates oscillations with an am- plitude of up to 0.1 cm−1. This known issue was also present in our case and needs to be ad- dressed since the long-range region of the PES is crucial for the scattering calculations at low col- lisional energies. The functions vsum lm obtained as a result of the steps described in section 2.3 in the asymptotic region were adjusted by fit- ting 5 points in the R-grid at 11, 12, 13, 15, and 17 ˚A to an expansion in inverse powers of R:   vsum lm (R) =   We kept only the first two terms in the inverse R-power expansion, n = ni and n = ni +2. The value of ni depends 31 on the value of l: ni = 6 for l = 0 and 2, ni = 7 for l = 1 and 3, and ni = l + 4 for l ≥ 4. Each function vsum lm is represented by two coefficients clmn. The ana- lytic form (4) for the asymptotic vsum lm functions was used for the first 78 radial functions, corre- sponding to all couples (l, m) with l < 12. All lm for l ≥ 12 and R ≥ 8 ˚A were set values of vsum to 0 in the long-range. Figure 3 shows the first 8 vsum   lm components.   distance, R = 5.0 ˚A. The position of these min- ima correspond to the helium atom approach- ing between the hydrogen atom and the C≡N group attached to the different C-atoms of the vinyl group, and between two hydrogen atoms of the CH2 group. The barrier between the min- ima is around 22 cm−1. For ϕ = 180◦ (panel (c)) we find a minimum with a well depth of V = −52.9 cm−1 at θ = 69◦, R = 3.6 ˚A while another local minimum is located at θ = 141◦, R = 4.3 ˚A with a well depth of V = −49.2 cm−1. These minima correspond to the helium atom approaching between the hydrogen atom and the C≡N group attached to the same C- atom, and between two hydrogen atoms around the double bond of the vinyl group. The two local minima are separated by a barrier of 28.5 cm−1. Interestingly, when the He atom is located in the molecular plane the local minimum only dif- fers from the global minimum by 0.6 cm−1. The energy of the minimum of the PES for fixed ϕ decreases from −44.6 cm−1 for ϕ = 0 to −53.5 cm−1 for ϕ = 51◦ before increasing to −47.1 cm−1 for ϕ = 90◦. It then decreases again un- til it reaches −52.9 cm−1 for ϕ = 180◦. This behaviour is displayed in panel (d) of Figure 4, which illustrates a two-dimensional cut of the PES along the angular coordinates θ and ϕ with R fixed to R = 3.6 ˚A. We note that the ener- gies of the minima in this figure are different from the ones discussed earlier, as the minima do not all occur for the same value of R. From this figure it is also clear that the anisotropy of the surface is much larger for rotations along the θ coordinate than the ϕ coordinate. This in- dicates that the rotation of the He atom around the molecule along the ϕ coordinate would be nearly unhindered in the van der Waals com- plex CH2CHCN-He.   Besides the isotropic term v00 with a well depth of 53 cm−1, for m = 0 the term with l = 2 slightly outweighs v10, v30, and the other anisotropic terms. This term is responsible for rotational transitions with ∆j = 2, which should affect the propensity rules of the rota- tional excitation.

Panels a and c correspond to the helium atom rotating around the molecule in the molecular plane.   The global minimum of the PES is found at for ϕ = 51◦, θ = 89◦, R = 3.3 ˚A correspond- ing to the He atom hovering over the molecular plane and with a well depth of V = −53.5 cm−1, as seen in panel (b).   When the He atom is in the molecular plane, several minima are observed. For ϕ = 0◦ (panel (a)), a local minimum is found at θ = 82◦, R = 3.5 ˚A, with a well depth of V = −44.6 cm−1. Another local minimum of V = −32.7 cm−1 can be seen at θ = 148◦ and a much larger   Figure 4: Two-dimensional contour plots of the interaction potential of the CH2CHCN-He complex.

Vinyl cyanide is an asymmetric top molecule with a rotational Hamiltonian written as: 32   Hrot = Aj2   z −Dkj4 z (5) where A, B and C are rotational constants, Dj, Djk, Dk are first order centrifugal distortion constants of vinyl cyanide and jx, jy, jz are the projections of the angular momentum j along y + j2 the principal inertia axes: j2 = j2 z . The rotational wave functions of a symmetric top molecule |jkm⟩ are no longer eigenfunctions of the rotational Hamiltonian in equation (5), but they are used in a linear combination to ex- press the asymmetric top wave functions |jτ m⟩ characterised by three quantum numbers j, τ , m:   aτ k|jkm⟩   rotational   levels of asymmetric   k where k denotes the projection of j along the z-axis of the body-fixed frame, m is the pro- jection on the space-fixed Z-axis and τ is an integer −j ≤ τ ≤ j which orders the energy levels for a given value of j. 33 The top molecules are labeled by ka and kc numbers representing the projections of the quantum number k along the axes of symmetry in the prolate and oblate symmetric top limits, respec- tively. The relation between ka and kc can also be expressed through τ : τ = ka − kc. The ro- tational constants A = 1.63701, B = 0.16583, C = 0.15057 (all in cm−1) were taken from the Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database (CCCBDB). 34 The centrifugal distortion constants were taken from the literature: 10 Dj = 7.2797 × 10−8, Djk = 2.8358 × 10−6 and Dk = 9.0559 × 10−5 (all in cm−1).

         "Repair of DNA damage is essential for genome integrity. DNA damage elicits a DNA damage response (DDR) that includes error-free and error-prone, i.e. mutagenic, repair. The SOS response is a widely conserved system in bacteria that regulates the DDR and depends on the recombinase RecA and the transcriptional repressor LexA. However, RecA/LexA-independent DDRs have been identified in several bacterial species. Here, using a whole-cell, label-free quantitative proteomics approach, we map the proteomic response in Myxococcus xanthus to mitomycin C treatment and the lack of LexA. In doing so, we confirm a LexA-independent DDR in M. xanthus. Using a candidate approach, we identify DdiA, a transcriptional regulator of the XRE family, and demonstrate that it regulates a subset of the LexA-independent DDR genes. ddiA is expressed heterogeneously in a subpopulation of cells in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress and reversibly induced population-wide in response to such stress. DdiA, indirectly or directly, activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Accordingly, the ΔddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, suggesting that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis. We speculate that the DdiA-dependent response is tailored to counter replication stress, thereby preventing the induction of the complete RecA/LexA-dependent DDR in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress. Importance DNA damage repair is essential for genome integrity and depends on the DNA damage response (DDR). While the RecA/LexA-dependent SOS response is widely conserved in bacteria, there are also RecA/LexA-independent DDRs. Here, we identify the DNA damage-induced transcriptional regulator DdiA in Myxococcus xanthus and demonstrate that it regulates part of the RecA/LexA-independent DDR. DdiA activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Because the ΔddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, we suggest that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis and that the DdiA-dependent DDR is specifically tailored to counter replication stress.",

Understanding these processes allows for earlier\ndetection of cardiovascular compromise and establishment of better prevention strategies.\nElevated resting heart rate (HR) was evident to be an independent risk factor for\nall-cause mortality rates [5,6]. An increase in resting HR was linked to numerous cardiovas-\ncular and metabolic diseases [7–9]. The Framingham study showed that for every increase\nof approximately 10 beats per minute (bpm) in HR, there is a consequent 14% escalation\nin mortality [6]. In addition, case fatality rates, sudden death from a coronary cause, and\nnon-cardiovascular and cardiovascular deaths all increased with elevated resting HR [6].\nAnother study in patients with stable CVD showed that resting and average HR are\nrelated to increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events [7]. Additionally, for\nevery increase in resting HR by 1 bpm, there was a subsequent 4% jump in relative risk\n(RR) of incident heart failure (HF) [8]. Such an increase affected left ventricular ejection\nfraction (LVEF) with a subsequent quantitative decrease in circumferential strain (εcc)\ndue to impaired circumferential fiber contraction, a phenomenon often seen in cases of\nHF or cardiomyopathy [8]. In simple terms, myocardial strain refers to the extent of\nmyocardial muscle deformation as the heart beats. Circumferential strain, in particular,\nrefers to the stretching and shortening of myocardial fibers along a circular axis around the\nheart (LV walls), with negative strain indicating stretching and positive strain indicating\nshortening. The aforementioned parameter remains a key component in assessing early\nchanges in myocardial and left ventricular function. So, not only is elevated baseline HR an\nindependent contributor to HF, but it is also one of the earliest hemodynamic markers of left\nventricular dysfunction (LVD), even before the onset of clinical symptoms or radiological\nwall-motion abnormalities [8]. Plus, a target HR of less than 80 bpm showed a benefit in\npatients with HF, despite that the mechanism remains vague [10].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAlternatively, elevated resting HR has been associated with HF and LVD even in\nasymptomatic patients with no previously known CVD. Since cardiac output (CO) is depen-\ndent on two major parameters, stroke volume (SV) and HR, a minor decrease in SV due to\nclinically insignificant LVD could potentially trigger a compensatory elevation in baseline\nHR [11]. Such an increase occurs before any neuroendocrine activation (norepinephrine) is\nidentified [12].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nWith the prognostic value of elevated resting/baseline HR being established in the\ngeneral population and in patients with HF or CVD, this review aims to better understand\nthe association between resting sinus tachycardia and adverse cardiovascular outcomes\n(ACVOs), as well as survival in cancer patients. Specifically, resting sinus tachycardia\ncould be an early sign of cardiovascular stress and compromise [13]. Thus, establishing its\nprognostic value could be the first step towards better management and hence prolonged\nsurvival in cancer patients [13].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n2.

The articles included retrospective\nand prospective case–control and observational studies which discussed the prognostic\nvalue of elevated baseline HR or ECG-determined resting sinus tachycardia on ACVOs and\nsurvival in cancer patients.

Hemodynamic Variability in Cancer\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nCancer patients notably suffer from hemodynamic dysfunction. SV, CO, systolic blood\npressure (SBP), and baseline HR are significantly higher in cancer patients as compared\nto the general population [14]. Additionally, research showed that during isovolumetric\ncontraction (early systole), the pressure rise at a maximal rate is higher in cancer patients\ncompared to the general population, which equates to greater strain on the heart [14]. It\nhas been hypothesized that the aforementioned parameters increase due to the elevated\nmetabolic demand and sympathetic overdrive, which are related to tumor burden [13].\nConsequently, it sheds light onto the presence of an elevated cardiovascular risk in this\nvulnerable group of patients as compared to the general population, which undoubtedly\nrequires more investigation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nGeigar et al. studied the changes in CO through a Doppler-ultrasound technique, as\ncompared to the widely used echocardiography, in patients with several types of cancer tak-\ning an anthracycline-based regimen [15]. The study showed that chemotherapy causes an\ninitial transient increase in CO followed by a permanent decrease [15]. Trimarchi et al. men-\ntioned that global longitudinal strain (GLS), introduced recently, is a more effective measure\nthan LVEF in detecting and handling cancer treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction [16].\nOf note, anthracyclines have been widely associated with severe cardiomyopathies due\nto their prominent cardiotoxic effect [17]. Another study aimed to assess the autonomic\ndysregulation (AD) seen in cancer patients due to various etiologies, such as chemother-\napy, poor lifestyle, radiation exposure, and the cancer itself [18]. The study showed that\ncomponents of AD, which includes vagal–sympathetic malfunction, increased resting HR,\nimpaired HR recovery, and minimal variability in HR, all serve as potential prognostic\nfactors for survival in various cancer subtypes [18]. Also, the hemodynamic instability\nseen in cancer patients has been directly related to the future development of hypertension,\nischemia, arrythmias and heart failure. In summary, cancer is a strong multi-system stressor\nwhich puts significant strain on normal physiology and hemodynamics.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.5**\n3.1. Sinus Tachycardia in Cancer\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nElevation in HR originating from the sinoatrial (SA) node, termed sinus tachycardia,\nis a frequent cardiovascular phenomenon seen in many cancer patients [14,17]. In order to\ngrasp the complex interplay between cancer, cancer treatments, and cardiovascular health,\nthe normal physiology of HR control should be outlined first. It is essential to differentiate\nresting sinus tachycardia from other tachyarrhythmias, with the former characterized by\nHR > 100 bpm originating from the SA node. Diagnosis involves ECG, Holter monitoring,\nechocardiography, autonomic function tests, and biomarkers (CRP, cytokines, troponin).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nHR is carefully regulated by the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system, which\nincludes the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems [19,20]. The right atrium houses\nthe SA node, which serves as the innate pacemaker of the heart [21,22]. The electric signal\noriginates at a constant frequency in the SA node, which ultimately sets the rhythm of\nthe heartbeat, a phenomenon described as “autorhythmicity” [22]. HR is cautiously regu-\nlated to respond adequately to the various human body needs and thus changes during\nrest, walking, exercise, stress, etc. [23]. Such regulation is governed by a neuroendocrine\nresponse to a change in our usual state of hemostasis. The parasympathetic system de-\ncreases the HR through increasing vagus nerve simulation, while the sympathetic system\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nincreases the HR through a catecholamine surge, thus responding sufficiently to any earthly\nrequirement [20,22].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe mechanism of resting sinus tachycardia in cancer patients is due to several factors\nthat disrupt the normal regulation of the HR. Examples include tumor burden, chemother-\napy, radiotherapy, and lifestyle factors [24]. One prospective observational study showed\nthat cancer patients have an elevated resting HR regardless of treatment initiation [25].\nThis shows that cancer itself holds a substantial detrimental effect on cardiovascular health\nbeyond the well-known cardiotoxicity seen with certain cancer treatments [24].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nCancer triggers inflammation, elevating inflammatory markers and activating the\nsympathetic nervous system and thus raising baseline HR [24,26]. Sakellakis et al. highlight\ncancer-induced resting sinus tachycardia as a common but often overlooked condition,\ndriven by structural cardiac changes, inflammation, cytokine release, thromboembolism,\ncompensatory responses, and pain [24].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAdditionally, it is quite common that cancer patients experience anxiety, depression,\nand increased levels of stress [27]. Stress is well known to tip the scale towards elevated\nHR. The sympathetic-to-parasympathetic ratio increase seen with stress is directly related\nto increased mortality in the general population, with its extrapolation being feasible to\ncancer patients as well [28].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nChemotherapy agents, including anthracyclines, alkylating agents, antimetabolites,\nand TKIs, are highly cardiotoxic [29]. Anthracyclines, in particular, damage cardiac\nmyocytes, reducing CO and triggering compensatory mechanisms that raise HR [17].\nChemotherapy also induces systemic inflammation and cytokine release, further activating\nthe sympathetic nervous system and increasing baseline HR [30,31].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nRadiotherapy damages the pericardium, coronary vessels, cardiac myocytes, and\nthe SA node, leading to atherosclerosis, fibrosis, and autonomic dysfunction, which can\ncause resting sinus tachycardia [32–34]. Radiation-induced inflammation also contributes\nto elevated HR [31].\nImmunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, causes\nmyocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and cytokine release syndrome, all of which strain the\nheart and increase HR [35–37]. Additionally, post-HSCT autonomic dysfunction and\ninflammation raise HR further [38].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe combined impact of various cancer therapies, tumor burden, lifestyle and myocar-\ndial structural changes, and systemic inflammation disrupts autonomic balance, increasing\nsympathetic activity and contributing to resting sinus tachycardia (Figure 1).

Multiple studies have shown the\neffect of tachycardia on cardiac hemodynamics, such as higher LV filling pressures, greater\nLV wall tension, and increased systemic resistance [39]. However, research specifically on\nresting sinus tachycardia is limited, especially in cancer patients (Table 1).

It looked at several\ncardiovascular parameters, including HF, and showed that resting sinus tachycardia is\nassociated with an increased incidence of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and\nacute HF exacerbation (AHFE) but not HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [13].\nThe reason could be due to a steady rise in myocardial oxygen demand because of a\nconstantly elevated HR. That can ultimately worsen a pre-existent cardiac compromise\nor ignite new-onset HF. The study also reiterated that resting sinus tachycardia is associ-\nated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy,\nthromboembolic events, and death [13].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\n3.3.

More recent studies have confirmed its vital role in predicting\ncardiovascular outcomes and survival in cancer patients (Table 1). The study conducted by\nHemu et al. showed that resting sinus tachycardia is an independent predictor of mortality\nin cancer patients after adjusting for confounders [13]. However, this study was limited by\na small sample size, discrepancy between the number of cases and controls (51 vs. 571),\na small Caucasian subset in the case group, and ambiguity in regard to the presence of\nresting sinus tachycardia prior to cancer diagnosis.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAnother prospective case–control study, conducted between 2005 and 2010, included\npatients with colorectal, pancreatic, and non-small-cell lung carcinoma and showed that an\nelevated resting HR on ECG is an independent predictor of survival in cancer patients [40].\nThe study conducted by Anker et al. followed 145 cases and 59 controls for 27 months\nand showed that healthy subjects had a statistically significant lower baseline HR on ECG\nas compared to cancer patients [40]. Consequently, a multivariate model showed that a\nresting HR ≥ 75 bpm markedly predicted survival in cancer patients [40]. The results of\nthe study suggest that elevated resting HR could serve as an important marker for survival\nin cancer patients. However, the limitations of the study include an inability to precisely\ndetermine the cause of death due an overly complex clinical picture in a high-risk patient\ncohort, short follow-up period of 27 months, and possibly missed confounders.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAnother retrospective observational study aimed to follow up 4786 breast cancer\npatients, stages I-III, for a total period of 5.0 ± 2.5 years [41]. The findings revealed a\nsignificant association between higher resting HR and increased mortality [41]. Specifically,\npatients with a resting HR of 85 compared to those with 67 had a higher all-cause and\nbreast cancer-specific mortality [41]. Each 10 bpm increase in HR corresponded to a 15%\nincrease in all-cause mortality and a 22% rise in cancer-specific mortality [41]. However,\nLee et al. mentioned that the precise underlying mechanism linking resting HR to cancer\nprognosis remains vague. It is undoubtedly a reflection of many lifestyle and behavioral\nelements, such as physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking [41]. Additionally,\ndetailed medication history, severity of comorbidities, and pre-existing diseases were hard\nto entirely account for [41]. Lastly, the external validity of the study is debatable since it\nwas geographically limited to South Korea [41]. Hence, further research should include a\nmore diverse cancer patient population.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nSimilarly, a prospective observational study followed up 104 lung cancer patients\nand showed that a heart rate > 90 bpm on ECG is an independent negative predictor\nof survival [42]. The study proposed that incorporating HR monitoring into routine\nclinical assessment could improve prognostic accuracy and influence management options.\nHowever, the result was not statistically significant, so one might consider this study\nwith caution. Another study was conducted at the Rush University Medical Center and\ninvolved 622 cancer patients with various types of cancer, including lung cancer, lymphoma,\nleukemia, and multiple myeloma over 8 years [43]. It showed that tachycardia was an\nindependent and significant predictor for all-cause mortality [43]. The main power-limiting\nsetback of the study is its small sample size (50).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFurthermore, one prospective study in 548 unselected treatment-naïve cancer patients\nshowed that for each 5 bpm increase in resting HR, there was an increase in all-cause\nmortality, even after adjusting for other variables such as tumor stage and cardiac health at\npresentation [25]. Also, researchers performed a subgroup analysis differentiating between\nthe types of cancer. Consequently, elevated resting HR was most strongly associated with\nmortality in lung and gastrointestinal cancer [25]. The major drawback of the study includes\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\na single baseline HR measurement prior to cancer treatment initiation, rather than multiple\nmeasurements on several visits or continuous measurements with a 24 h Holter. This does\nnot provide any insight into the average HR and HR variability and makes relying on a\nsingle measurement insufficient to draw any firm and safe conclusions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nLastly, one study aimed to understand the clinical role of HR in post-HSCT. Since many\npost-HSCT patients die from CVD-related complications, whether acutely or chronically, it\nwas crucial to delineate the possible prognostic factors which could potentially predict the\nrisk of developing HF or arrythmias in this subset of patients [38]. Lopez-Candales et al.\ndescribed that an elevated HR was associated with worse clinical outcomes, suggesting\nthat it could serve as a prominent prognostic marker in this specific patient population [38].\nThis study further extends our understanding of the significance of HR assessment across\ndifferent cancer treatments.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.2**\n4. Therapeutic Opportunities\n4.1. General Therapeutic Approaches for Managing Sinus Tachycardia\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nTreating resting sinus tachycardia requires a personalized approach depending on\nwhether the patient is symptomatic or not. The symptoms of resting sinus tachycardia\ninclude palpitations, dizziness, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, anxiety or feeling of\nrestlessness, decreased exercise tolerance, and reduced quality of life [44,45]. Treating it\nentails maximizing both pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe two mainstay treatment options for resting sinus tachycardia are beta blockers\n(BBs) and Ivabradine. The latter is more commonly used when there is poor response or\nintolerability to BBs due to side effects [46]. BBs reduce HR by blocking beta-adrenergic\nreceptors in the heart [47,48]. Alternatively, Ivabradine inhibits the pacemaker If current,\nwhich is found in the SA node, thus directly reducing HR without affecting other hemody-\nnamic variables, like in the case of BBs or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) [46,48,49]. The\nselective inhibition seen with Ivabradine could be the solution when the physician aims to\navoid the effects of BBs or CCBs on contractility and blood pressure [49]. The effectiveness of\nIvabradine in managing resting sinus tachycardia has been described in cases of tachycardia-\ninduced cardiomyopathy, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, tachycardia-induced HF and\nsevere cardiomyopathy with mitral regurgitation, acute HF in inflammatory rheumatic\ndisease, and advanced HF patients on extracorporeal life support [50–56].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nNon-pharmacological interventions are considered in conjunction with pharmacother-\napy [45,57]. Examples include avoiding excessive caffeine or alcohol, hot environments,\nprolonged standing, dehydration, or stress [45,57] and simply avoiding anything which\ndecreases CO or activates the sympathetic nervous system. It also entails addressing the\npossible underlying causes, such as hyperthyroidism, inflammation, infection, or ane-\nmia [45,50,55], and avoiding volume-depleting and veno-dilating agents such as diuretics\nand nitrates, which is not always possible, especially in cases of concomitant HF [57].\nAs stated, a huge portion of treating and optimizing elevated HR relies on internalizing\na healthy lifestyle. Now, when both pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy are\nnot enough for achieving symptomatic relief, more invasive techniques such as catheter\nablation can be utilized in the treatment of resistant resting sinus tachycardia [58].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nIn regard to asymptomatic patients who exhibit elevated HR without experiencing\nany debilitating symptoms, a more conservative approach is usually desirable. It relies on\nlifestyle modifications and frequent follow-ups to assess the development of tachycardia-\ninduced complications and prevent them prior to their clinical onset.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nIn brief, intervening is only justifiable if there are debilitating symptoms or when there\nis a prominent risk of progression to a more serious cardiovascular condition such as HF,\narrythmias, or cardiomyopathy.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nA personalized approach is necessary when managing such delicate patients. This\nshould focus on the specific cancer subtype, chemotherapy/radiotherapy regimen, and\nindividual patient characteristics.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nLai et al. showed that BBs, specifically metoprolol, can be used in treating resting sinus\ntachycardia peri-operatively in patients undergoing esophageal cancer resection [59]. This\nresult could potentially be extrapolated and applied to treating resting sinus tachycardia\nin esophageal cancer and cancer patients in general. Alternatively, one study showed\nthat Ivabradine can be useful in post-HSCT patients with acute HF and resting sinus\ntachycardia [60]. This was further supported by another study which showed favorable\neffect of Ivabradine in treating resting sinus tachycardia in patients suffering from paragan-\nglioma [61]. Also, Harada et al. showed that Ivabradine is safe and efficacious in achieving\nHR control in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy [62].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe selectivity of the mechanism of action seen with Ivabradine is especially useful in\ncancer patients who already have compromised cardiovascular status and hemodynamic\ninstability [60–62]. On the other hand, less selective drugs such as BBs can lead to a reduc-\ntion in myocardial contractility and subsequent hypotension, which could be detrimental\nin the setting of cancer [60,61].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nWhile some studies suggest Ivabradine may help manage resting sinus tachycardia in\ncancer patients, they are limited by small sample sizes, specific populations, short follow-up\nduration, retrospective or case report designs, and single-centered approaches. These gaps\nunderscore the need for larger, well-designed RCTs that assess long-term outcomes across\ncancer populations while accounting for confounders. However, research is challenging due\nto Ivabradine’s interactions with some chemotherapy agents and prophylactic antifungal\ndrugs. For example, coadministration with voriconazole (VFEND) can cause long QT\nsyndrome and life-threatening arrhythmias such as Torsade de Pointes [63], raising ethical\nconcerns and limiting RCT eligibility.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nBesides using pharmacotherapy solely for managing resting sinus tachycardia, there\nare some cardioprotective medications which can be utilized to mitigate chemotherapy-\ninduced cardiotoxicity. Various BBs have antioxidant properties which reduce free radical\nformation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation, thus lowering the level\nof Troponin I and cardiac dysfunction [64]. Renin–angiotensin inhibitors, angiotensin\nreceptors–neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are well known\nfor limiting cardiac remodeling and reducing myocardial fibrosis, with some studies show-\ning positive effects on preserving EF during chemotherapy [64]. Additionally, the MAN-\nTICORE 101- breast trial showed promising results when using combination therapy of\nperindopril and bisoprolol in LVEF decline during trastuzumab therapy [65]. Statins also\nhelp through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [64]. Lastly, Dexrazoxane\nis the only FDA-approved compound for reducing doxorubin-induced cardiotoxicity [64].\nIt acts through lowering anthracycline–iron complex formation, therefore reducing reactive\noxygen species (ROS) formation and consequent oxidative damage [64]. Despite this evi-\ndence, there are no accepted and universal guidelines and their addition is therefore solely\ndependent on patient-specific parameters and the treating physicians.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nCancer patients can also benefit substantially from addressing risk factors such as\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and lack of physical activity\nbefore and during cancer treatment [64,66]. In particular, exercise was shown to be car-\ndioprotective for cancer patients as it improves the tolerance of the myocardium against\ncardiotoxic agents, lowers the formation of ROS, and enhances overall endothelial func-\ntion [64]. More specifically, endurance training reduced the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin\nin vivo [67]. It was hypothesized to be due to enhancing the cellular and mitochondrial\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\ndefense mechanisms and reducing oxidative stress by lowering the overall intracellular\nlevels of doxorubicin [67]. This is quite important as doxorubicin remains one of the most\ncardiotoxic agents used.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nLastly, a more conservative approach entails reducing the dose of the chemotherapy\nagent used or administering it with a slower infusion rate [64]. For example, Van Dalen\net al. showed that administering anthracyclines with an infusion duration of more than\nsix hours was favorable in decreasing the risk of HF [68]. This is consistent with other\navailable evidence which shows that anthracyclines exhibit a dose-dependent cellular\ntoxicity through altering the mitochondrial membrane permeability in a dose-dependent\nmanner [69–71].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAlternatively, there are newer agents that are considered more cardioprotective than\nthe traditional formulations. Liposomal anthracycline, particularly pegylated liposomal\ndoxorubicin, showed decreased cardiotoxicity and fewer cardiac events without compro-\nmising efficacy as compared to traditional doxorubicin [72]. But its long-term effect on\ncardiovascular health is still unknown [72]. Liposomal formulations are well known to\nconcentrate in pathological areas such as in inflamed or damaged tissues. This facilitates\ntargeted drug delivery and minimizes exposure of healthy non-targeted organs to the drug.\nHowever, in the context of a pre-existing or new “damaged” heart, one can hypothesize\nthat such a molecule would paradoxically worsen the damage. Other potential benefits\nof liposomal formulations stem from their stability and resistance to degradation which\nenhances their bioavailability in the targeted place. Additionally, their sustained release\nand increased circulation time provide a stable and safer concentration for a longer period.\nDespite the numerous advantages, more data are needed to adequately describe their\ncardiovascular safety profile.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nOther agents, such as targeted therapy (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) and immunother-\napy, are more selective in destroying cancerous cells and avoiding the heart, which paves\nthe way for creating more selective cancer treatment options that will not sacrifice the\nheart alongside the malignancy. Figure 2 summarizes the key pharmacologic and non-\npharmacologic interventions for reducing HR in cancer patients.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 2.

Knowledge Gaps and Further Research\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nStudies evaluating the association between elevated resting HR and the risk of ACVOs\nin cancer patients are scarce [38–40]. Most studies have concentrated on specific cancer\ntypes, namely lung, breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, due to their high prevalence\nand associated mortality rates [38–40]. Only one study analyzed ECG-detected resting\nsinus tachycardia cumulatively in all types of cancer and described specific ACVOs [13].\nUnfortunately, most studies mentioned the difficulty in addressing the precise cause of\ndeath in cancer patients due the complexity of the clinical picture and the rarity of autopsies\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nperformed, since the majority often die at home or in hospice care [24,39]. Some patients\nwith cancer and chemotherapy-induced severe cardiomyopathy have increased mortality if\nthey do not improve on guideline-directed medical therapy and do not have an implantable\ncardioverter defibrillator [73]. Further, some arrhythmias including premature ventricular\ncontractions can lead to ASCOs [74]. Consequently, it would be hard to predict the true\nimpact of elevated HR on the development of ACVOs, as many patients die before ACVOs\nmanifest, or the cause of death might be due to a cardiovascular deficit which would not be\ncaptured post-mortem.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAlso, it is a possibility that the resting sinus tachycardia observed in cancer patients\ncould be a byproduct of the tumor burden, whether it be from the widespread systemic\ninflammation or the hypermetabolic state caused by the cancer itself. This poses a serious\nquestion of whether treating resting sinus tachycardia in this patient population would\nmute the compensatory response intentionally generated by the body. On the other hand,\nAnker et al. found that resting heart rate was not related to cancer stage; hence, terminal\ndisease is not a prerequisite for resting sinus tachycardia [24,38]. Also, no research is avail-\nable to suggest whether asymptomatic resting sinus tachycardia should be treated, besides\nadvising for the standard life-style modifications. And no studies are available to suggest\nwhether treating asymptomatic tachycardia would affect morbidity and mortality. The\naforementioned is not described for the general CVD population, let alone cancer patients.\nLastly, cancer patients are a vulnerable population with an already increased risk of\ncardiovascular compromise, so addressing cardiovascular parameters here cannot just rely\non studies extrapolated from the general population. Hence, this subject is a prominent\ngap in the literature with a crucial need for further investigation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n6. Conclusions\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nResting sinus tachycardia is a complex phenomenon with a multifactorial etiology and\nprominent clinical and prognostic implications on cancer patient health and survival. It is\na real clinical challenge and therefore necessitates comprehensive diagnostic approaches\nand treatment guidelines. It can stem from the effect of the tumor burden, wide-spread\ninflammation, treatment-related toxicity, comorbidities, and psychological stress. Adequate\nmanagement involves utilizing both pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy, man-\naging underlying conditions, switching or adjusting cancer treatments to involve more\ncardio-neutral formulations, and optimizing the quality of life, with a patient-centered\nand holistic multidisciplinary approach. This review focused on providing a scope of the\navailable evidence on resting sinus tachycardia in cancer patients while focusing on its\nimpact on ACVOs and overall survival, as well as providing a basic understanding of the\naccessible therapeutic options. However, it is crucial to have new and ongoing research to\nbetter grasp the pathophysiology and thus develop more targeted therapeutic strategies\nbeyond the mainstream BBs. Establishing evidence-based guidelines to treat resting sinus\ntachycardia in cancer patients is one step closer towards achieving better clinical outcomes\nand optimizing cancer care.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M.R., M.K. and M.A.S.; methodology, Y.F. and M.A.S.;\nwriting—original draft preparation, Y.F.; writing—review and editing, Y.F., M.A.S. and A.E.G.;\nvisualization, Y.F. and A.E.G.; supervision, M.M.R. and M.K All authors have read and agreed to the\npublished version of the manuscript.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.3**r== 0.4**\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare that this review paper was not influenced by any competing\nfinancial gain or personal relationship.

It affects a wide variety of cancer patients and is associated with distressing symptoms. Cancer- associated resting sinus tachycardia varies in its underlying mechanism. It can stem from the tumor burden or the side effects of chemotherapy/radiotherapy, or it can be secondary to paraneoplastic syndrome or the sequalae of cancer itself (infection, anemia, thrombosis, etc.). The clinical significance of resting sinus tachycardia extends beyond mere symptoma- tology, as it can potentially indicate severe complications which may facilitate or exacerbate a new or underlying cardiovascular dysfunction. Therefore, this necessitates thorough diagnostic tools to discern the underlying cause and tailor appropriate management strate- gies, whether pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or conservative. While resting sinus tachycardia has been extensively investigated in the context of cardiovascular disease, its underlying etiology, clinical implication, prognostic value, and treatment options remain vague in the context of cancer. This review aims to explore the topic of resting sinus tachycardia in cancer patients through delving deeper into its underlying mechanism, presenting the current evidence on its effect on cancer-independent cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, as well as providing some insight into the currently available treatment options. It will also propose therapeutic interventions and strategies aimed at optimizing cancer patient care. Lastly, it will highlight research gaps which need to be addressed further, as future research is needed to refine the diagnostic criteria, develop targeted thera- pies, find alternative cardioprotective/cardio-neutral chemotherapy options, and establish evidence-based guidelines to improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.   Keywords: cancer; tumor; neoplasm; malignancy; leukemia; lymphoma; resting sinus tachycardia   Cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the leading causes of death worldwide. Both share several common risk factors, which include older age, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, elevated BMI, pollution, smoking, and alcohol [1,2]. Emerging research suggests that chronic inflammation may have a shared pathological mechanism linking these two conditions [3]. In oncology patients, the development of cardiovascular dysfunction extends beyond the well-documented cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy and radiation. These include arrhythmias and sinus tachycardia, as well as hemodynamic instability, atherosclerosis, and   other cardiovascular complications [4]. Understanding these processes allows for earlier detection of cardiovascular compromise and establishment of better prevention strategies. Elevated resting heart rate (HR) was evident to be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality rates [5,6]. An increase in resting HR was linked to numerous cardiovas- cular and metabolic diseases [7–9]. The Framingham study showed that for every increase of approximately 10 beats per minute (bpm) in HR, there is a consequent 14% escalation in mortality [6]. In addition, case fatality rates, sudden death from a coronary cause, and non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular deaths all increased with elevated resting HR [6]. Another study in patients with stable CVD showed that resting and average HR are related to increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events [7]. Additionally, for every increase in resting HR by 1 bpm, there was a subsequent 4% jump in relative risk (RR) of incident heart failure (HF) [8]. Such an increase affected left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with a subsequent quantitative decrease in circumferential strain (εcc) due to impaired circumferential fiber contraction, a phenomenon often seen in cases of HF or cardiomyopathy [8]. In simple terms, myocardial strain refers to the extent of myocardial muscle deformation as the heart beats. Circumferential strain, in particular, refers to the stretching and shortening of myocardial fibers along a circular axis around the heart (LV walls), with negative strain indicating stretching and positive strain indicating shortening. The aforementioned parameter remains a key component in assessing early changes in myocardial and left ventricular function. So, not only is elevated baseline HR an independent contributor to HF, but it is also one of the earliest hemodynamic markers of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), even before the onset of clinical symptoms or radiological wall-motion abnormalities [8]. Plus, a target HR of less than 80 bpm showed a benefit in patients with HF, despite that the mechanism remains vague [10].   Alternatively, elevated resting HR has been associated with HF and LVD even in asymptomatic patients with no previously known CVD. Since cardiac output (CO) is depen- dent on two major parameters, stroke volume (SV) and HR, a minor decrease in SV due to clinically insignificant LVD could potentially trigger a compensatory elevation in baseline HR [11]. Such an increase occurs before any neuroendocrine activation (norepinephrine) is identified [12].   With the prognostic value of elevated resting/baseline HR being established in the general population and in patients with HF or CVD, this review aims to better understand the association between resting sinus tachycardia and adverse cardiovascular outcomes (ACVOs), as well as survival in cancer patients. Specifically, resting sinus tachycardia could be an early sign of cardiovascular stress and compromise [13]. Thus, establishing its prognostic value could be the first step towards better management and hence prolonged survival in cancer patients [13].   Three databases, including Pubmed, Ovid Medline, and CINAHL, were searched until 3 October 2024 using both keywords and MeSH terms, including “Cancer” OR “Tumor” OR “Neoplasm” OR “Malignan*” OR “Leukemia” OR “Lymphoma” and “Sinus Tachycardia”. The outcome of interest, “Adverse Cardiovascular Outcome”, was not included in the search strategy due to a very low number of papers. The articles included retrospective and prospective case–control and observational studies which discussed the prognostic value of elevated baseline HR or ECG-determined resting sinus tachycardia on ACVOs and survival in cancer patients. Exclusion criteria included articles which tackled the overall prognosis and complications of specific cancer subtypes.   Two authors screened the titles of relevant articles and abstracts. The yielded articles were screened to fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria and duplicates were removed. In case   of any disagreement regarding the relevancy of an article, the two authors discussed the subject matter until consensus was reached. Since the search yielded a very low number of articles, the authors manually screened the reference lists of those articles in order to identify additional relevant papers.   3. Hemodynamic Variability in Cancer   Cancer patients notably suffer from hemodynamic dysfunction. SV, CO, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and baseline HR are significantly higher in cancer patients as compared to the general population [14]. Additionally, research showed that during isovolumetric contraction (early systole), the pressure rise at a maximal rate is higher in cancer patients compared to the general population, which equates to greater strain on the heart [14]. It has been hypothesized that the aforementioned parameters increase due to the elevated metabolic demand and sympathetic overdrive, which are related to tumor burden [13]. Consequently, it sheds light onto the presence of an elevated cardiovascular risk in this vulnerable group of patients as compared to the general population, which undoubtedly requires more investigation.   Geigar et al. studied the changes in CO through a Doppler-ultrasound technique, as compared to the widely used echocardiography, in patients with several types of cancer tak- ing an anthracycline-based regimen [15]. The study showed that chemotherapy causes an initial transient increase in CO followed by a permanent decrease [15]. Trimarchi et al. men- tioned that global longitudinal strain (GLS), introduced recently, is a more effective measure than LVEF in detecting and handling cancer treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction [16]. Of note, anthracyclines have been widely associated with severe cardiomyopathies due to their prominent cardiotoxic effect [17]. Another study aimed to assess the autonomic dysregulation (AD) seen in cancer patients due to various etiologies, such as chemother- apy, poor lifestyle, radiation exposure, and the cancer itself [18]. The study showed that components of AD, which includes vagal–sympathetic malfunction, increased resting HR, impaired HR recovery, and minimal variability in HR, all serve as potential prognostic factors for survival in various cancer subtypes [18]. Also, the hemodynamic instability seen in cancer patients has been directly related to the future development of hypertension, ischemia, arrythmias and heart failure. In summary, cancer is a strong multi-system stressor which puts significant strain on normal physiology and hemodynamics.   3.1. Sinus Tachycardia in Cancer   Elevation in HR originating from the sinoatrial (SA) node, termed sinus tachycardia, is a frequent cardiovascular phenomenon seen in many cancer patients [14,17]. In order to grasp the complex interplay between cancer, cancer treatments, and cardiovascular health, the normal physiology of HR control should be outlined first. It is essential to differentiate resting sinus tachycardia from other tachyarrhythmias, with the former characterized by HR > 100 bpm originating from the SA node. Diagnosis involves ECG, Holter monitoring, echocardiography, autonomic function tests, and biomarkers (CRP, cytokines, troponin).   HR is carefully regulated by the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system, which includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems [19,20]. The right atrium houses the SA node, which serves as the innate pacemaker of the heart [21,22]. The electric signal originates at a constant frequency in the SA node, which ultimately sets the rhythm of the heartbeat, a phenomenon described as “autorhythmicity” [22]. HR is cautiously regu- lated to respond adequately to the various human body needs and thus changes during rest, walking, exercise, stress, etc. [23]. Such regulation is governed by a neuroendocrine response to a change in our usual state of hemostasis. The parasympathetic system de- creases the HR through increasing vagus nerve simulation, while the sympathetic system   increases the HR through a catecholamine surge, thus responding sufficiently to any earthly requirement [20,22].   The mechanism of resting sinus tachycardia in cancer patients is due to several factors that disrupt the normal regulation of the HR. Examples include tumor burden, chemother- apy, radiotherapy, and lifestyle factors [24]. One prospective observational study showed that cancer patients have an elevated resting HR regardless of treatment initiation [25]. This shows that cancer itself holds a substantial detrimental effect on cardiovascular health beyond the well-known cardiotoxicity seen with certain cancer treatments [24].   Cancer triggers inflammation, elevating inflammatory markers and activating the sympathetic nervous system and thus raising baseline HR [24,26]. Sakellakis et al. highlight cancer-induced resting sinus tachycardia as a common but often overlooked condition, driven by structural cardiac changes, inflammation, cytokine release, thromboembolism, compensatory responses, and pain [24].   Additionally, it is quite common that cancer patients experience anxiety, depression, and increased levels of stress [27]. Stress is well known to tip the scale towards elevated HR. The sympathetic-to-parasympathetic ratio increase seen with stress is directly related to increased mortality in the general population, with its extrapolation being feasible to cancer patients as well [28].   Chemotherapy agents, including anthracyclines, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and TKIs, are highly cardiotoxic [29]. Anthracyclines, in particular, damage cardiac myocytes, reducing CO and triggering compensatory mechanisms that raise HR [17]. Chemotherapy also induces systemic inflammation and cytokine release, further activating the sympathetic nervous system and increasing baseline HR [30,31].   Radiotherapy damages the pericardium, coronary vessels, cardiac myocytes, and the SA node, leading to atherosclerosis, fibrosis, and autonomic dysfunction, which can cause resting sinus tachycardia [32–34]. Radiation-induced inflammation also contributes to elevated HR [31]. Immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, causes myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and cytokine release syndrome, all of which strain the heart and increase HR [35–37]. Additionally, post-HSCT autonomic dysfunction and inflammation raise HR further [38].   The combined impact of various cancer therapies, tumor burden, lifestyle and myocar- dial structural changes, and systemic inflammation disrupts autonomic balance, increasing sympathetic activity and contributing to resting sinus tachycardia (Figure 1). Timely identification and management are crucial for improving outcomes and survival.   3.2. Association Between Resting Sinus Tachycardia and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Cancer Patients   Elevated resting HR is a known predictor of cardiovascular mortality in both the gen- eral population and individuals with chronic CVD [6–8]. Multiple studies have shown the effect of tachycardia on cardiac hemodynamics, such as higher LV filling pressures, greater LV wall tension, and increased systemic resistance [39]. However, research specifically on resting sinus tachycardia is limited, especially in cancer patients (Table 1). To date, only one study has examined the link between resting sinus tachycardia and ACVOs in this population [13].   A study by Hemu et al. included 622 patients: 51 cancer patients with ECG-defined resting sinus tachycardia age- and sex-matched to 571 controls [13]. It looked at several cardiovascular parameters, including HF, and showed that resting sinus tachycardia is associated with an increased incidence of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and acute HF exacerbation (AHFE) but not HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [13]. The reason could be due to a steady rise in myocardial oxygen demand because of a constantly elevated HR. That can ultimately worsen a pre-existent cardiac compromise or ignite new-onset HF. The study also reiterated that resting sinus tachycardia is associ- ated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic events, and death [13].   3.3. Association Between Elevated Resting Heart Rate/Sinus Tachycardia and Overall Survival in Cancer Patients   The prognostic value of resting sinus tachycardia has been well established in the general population [5]. More recent studies have confirmed its vital role in predicting cardiovascular outcomes and survival in cancer patients (Table 1). The study conducted by Hemu et al. showed that resting sinus tachycardia is an independent predictor of mortality in cancer patients after adjusting for confounders [13]. However, this study was limited by a small sample size, discrepancy between the number of cases and controls (51 vs. 571), a small Caucasian subset in the case group, and ambiguity in regard to the presence of resting sinus tachycardia prior to cancer diagnosis.   Another prospective case–control study, conducted between 2005 and 2010, included patients with colorectal, pancreatic, and non-small-cell lung carcinoma and showed that an elevated resting HR on ECG is an independent predictor of survival in cancer patients [40]. The study conducted by Anker et al. followed 145 cases and 59 controls for 27 months and showed that healthy subjects had a statistically significant lower baseline HR on ECG as compared to cancer patients [40]. Consequently, a multivariate model showed that a resting HR ≥ 75 bpm markedly predicted survival in cancer patients [40]. The results of the study suggest that elevated resting HR could serve as an important marker for survival in cancer patients. However, the limitations of the study include an inability to precisely determine the cause of death due an overly complex clinical picture in a high-risk patient cohort, short follow-up period of 27 months, and possibly missed confounders.   Another retrospective observational study aimed to follow up 4786 breast cancer patients, stages I-III, for a total period of 5.0 ± 2.5 years [41]. The findings revealed a significant association between higher resting HR and increased mortality [41]. Specifically, patients with a resting HR of 85 compared to those with 67 had a higher all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality [41]. Each 10 bpm increase in HR corresponded to a 15% increase in all-cause mortality and a 22% rise in cancer-specific mortality [41]. However, Lee et al. mentioned that the precise underlying mechanism linking resting HR to cancer prognosis remains vague. It is undoubtedly a reflection of many lifestyle and behavioral elements, such as physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking [41]. Additionally, detailed medication history, severity of comorbidities, and pre-existing diseases were hard to entirely account for [41]. Lastly, the external validity of the study is debatable since it was geographically limited to South Korea [41]. Hence, further research should include a more diverse cancer patient population.   Similarly, a prospective observational study followed up 104 lung cancer patients and showed that a heart rate > 90 bpm on ECG is an independent negative predictor of survival [42]. The study proposed that incorporating HR monitoring into routine clinical assessment could improve prognostic accuracy and influence management options. However, the result was not statistically significant, so one might consider this study with caution. Another study was conducted at the Rush University Medical Center and involved 622 cancer patients with various types of cancer, including lung cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma over 8 years [43]. It showed that tachycardia was an independent and significant predictor for all-cause mortality [43]. The main power-limiting setback of the study is its small sample size (50).   Furthermore, one prospective study in 548 unselected treatment-naïve cancer patients showed that for each 5 bpm increase in resting HR, there was an increase in all-cause mortality, even after adjusting for other variables such as tumor stage and cardiac health at presentation [25]. Also, researchers performed a subgroup analysis differentiating between the types of cancer. Consequently, elevated resting HR was most strongly associated with mortality in lung and gastrointestinal cancer [25]. The major drawback of the study includes   a single baseline HR measurement prior to cancer treatment initiation, rather than multiple measurements on several visits or continuous measurements with a 24 h Holter. This does not provide any insight into the average HR and HR variability and makes relying on a single measurement insufficient to draw any firm and safe conclusions.   Lastly, one study aimed to understand the clinical role of HR in post-HSCT. Since many post-HSCT patients die from CVD-related complications, whether acutely or chronically, it was crucial to delineate the possible prognostic factors which could potentially predict the risk of developing HF or arrythmias in this subset of patients [38]. Lopez-Candales et al. described that an elevated HR was associated with worse clinical outcomes, suggesting that it could serve as a prominent prognostic marker in this specific patient population [38]. This study further extends our understanding of the significance of HR assessment across different cancer treatments.   4. Therapeutic Opportunities 4.1. General Therapeutic Approaches for Managing Sinus Tachycardia   Treating resting sinus tachycardia requires a personalized approach depending on whether the patient is symptomatic or not. The symptoms of resting sinus tachycardia include palpitations, dizziness, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, anxiety or feeling of restlessness, decreased exercise tolerance, and reduced quality of life [44,45]. Treating it entails maximizing both pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities.   The two mainstay treatment options for resting sinus tachycardia are beta blockers (BBs) and Ivabradine. The latter is more commonly used when there is poor response or intolerability to BBs due to side effects [46]. BBs reduce HR by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart [47,48]. Alternatively, Ivabradine inhibits the pacemaker If current, which is found in the SA node, thus directly reducing HR without affecting other hemody- namic variables, like in the case of BBs or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) [46,48,49]. The selective inhibition seen with Ivabradine could be the solution when the physician aims to avoid the effects of BBs or CCBs on contractility and blood pressure [49]. The effectiveness of Ivabradine in managing resting sinus tachycardia has been described in cases of tachycardia- induced cardiomyopathy, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, tachycardia-induced HF and severe cardiomyopathy with mitral regurgitation, acute HF in inflammatory rheumatic disease, and advanced HF patients on extracorporeal life support [50–56].   Non-pharmacological interventions are considered in conjunction with pharmacother- apy [45,57]. Examples include avoiding excessive caffeine or alcohol, hot environments, prolonged standing, dehydration, or stress [45,57] and simply avoiding anything which decreases CO or activates the sympathetic nervous system. It also entails addressing the possible underlying causes, such as hyperthyroidism, inflammation, infection, or ane- mia [45,50,55], and avoiding volume-depleting and veno-dilating agents such as diuretics and nitrates, which is not always possible, especially in cases of concomitant HF [57]. As stated, a huge portion of treating and optimizing elevated HR relies on internalizing a healthy lifestyle. Now, when both pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy are not enough for achieving symptomatic relief, more invasive techniques such as catheter ablation can be utilized in the treatment of resistant resting sinus tachycardia [58].   In regard to asymptomatic patients who exhibit elevated HR without experiencing any debilitating symptoms, a more conservative approach is usually desirable. It relies on lifestyle modifications and frequent follow-ups to assess the development of tachycardia- induced complications and prevent them prior to their clinical onset.   In brief, intervening is only justifiable if there are debilitating symptoms or when there is a prominent risk of progression to a more serious cardiovascular condition such as HF, arrythmias, or cardiomyopathy.   A personalized approach is necessary when managing such delicate patients. This should focus on the specific cancer subtype, chemotherapy/radiotherapy regimen, and individual patient characteristics.   Lai et al. showed that BBs, specifically metoprolol, can be used in treating resting sinus tachycardia peri-operatively in patients undergoing esophageal cancer resection [59]. This result could potentially be extrapolated and applied to treating resting sinus tachycardia in esophageal cancer and cancer patients in general. Alternatively, one study showed that Ivabradine can be useful in post-HSCT patients with acute HF and resting sinus tachycardia [60]. This was further supported by another study which showed favorable effect of Ivabradine in treating resting sinus tachycardia in patients suffering from paragan- glioma [61]. Also, Harada et al. showed that Ivabradine is safe and efficacious in achieving HR control in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy [62].   The selectivity of the mechanism of action seen with Ivabradine is especially useful in cancer patients who already have compromised cardiovascular status and hemodynamic instability [60–62]. On the other hand, less selective drugs such as BBs can lead to a reduc- tion in myocardial contractility and subsequent hypotension, which could be detrimental in the setting of cancer [60,61].   While some studies suggest Ivabradine may help manage resting sinus tachycardia in cancer patients, they are limited by small sample sizes, specific populations, short follow-up duration, retrospective or case report designs, and single-centered approaches. These gaps underscore the need for larger, well-designed RCTs that assess long-term outcomes across cancer populations while accounting for confounders. However, research is challenging due to Ivabradine’s interactions with some chemotherapy agents and prophylactic antifungal drugs. For example, coadministration with voriconazole (VFEND) can cause long QT syndrome and life-threatening arrhythmias such as Torsade de Pointes [63], raising ethical concerns and limiting RCT eligibility.   Besides using pharmacotherapy solely for managing resting sinus tachycardia, there are some cardioprotective medications which can be utilized to mitigate chemotherapy- induced cardiotoxicity. Various BBs have antioxidant properties which reduce free radical formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation, thus lowering the level of Troponin I and cardiac dysfunction [64]. Renin–angiotensin inhibitors, angiotensin receptors–neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are well known for limiting cardiac remodeling and reducing myocardial fibrosis, with some studies show- ing positive effects on preserving EF during chemotherapy [64]. Additionally, the MAN- TICORE 101- breast trial showed promising results when using combination therapy of perindopril and bisoprolol in LVEF decline during trastuzumab therapy [65]. Statins also help through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [64]. Lastly, Dexrazoxane is the only FDA-approved compound for reducing doxorubin-induced cardiotoxicity [64]. It acts through lowering anthracycline–iron complex formation, therefore reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and consequent oxidative damage [64]. Despite this evi- dence, there are no accepted and universal guidelines and their addition is therefore solely dependent on patient-specific parameters and the treating physicians.   Cancer patients can also benefit substantially from addressing risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and lack of physical activity before and during cancer treatment [64,66]. In particular, exercise was shown to be car- dioprotective for cancer patients as it improves the tolerance of the myocardium against cardiotoxic agents, lowers the formation of ROS, and enhances overall endothelial func- tion [64]. More specifically, endurance training reduced the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin in vivo [67]. It was hypothesized to be due to enhancing the cellular and mitochondrial   defense mechanisms and reducing oxidative stress by lowering the overall intracellular levels of doxorubicin [67]. This is quite important as doxorubicin remains one of the most cardiotoxic agents used.   Lastly, a more conservative approach entails reducing the dose of the chemotherapy agent used or administering it with a slower infusion rate [64]. For example, Van Dalen et al. showed that administering anthracyclines with an infusion duration of more than six hours was favorable in decreasing the risk of HF [68]. This is consistent with other available evidence which shows that anthracyclines exhibit a dose-dependent cellular toxicity through altering the mitochondrial membrane permeability in a dose-dependent manner [69–71].   Alternatively, there are newer agents that are considered more cardioprotective than the traditional formulations. Liposomal anthracycline, particularly pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, showed decreased cardiotoxicity and fewer cardiac events without compro- mising efficacy as compared to traditional doxorubicin [72]. But its long-term effect on cardiovascular health is still unknown [72]. Liposomal formulations are well known to concentrate in pathological areas such as in inflamed or damaged tissues. This facilitates targeted drug delivery and minimizes exposure of healthy non-targeted organs to the drug. However, in the context of a pre-existing or new “damaged” heart, one can hypothesize that such a molecule would paradoxically worsen the damage. Other potential benefits of liposomal formulations stem from their stability and resistance to degradation which enhances their bioavailability in the targeted place. Additionally, their sustained release and increased circulation time provide a stable and safer concentration for a longer period. Despite the numerous advantages, more data are needed to adequately describe their cardiovascular safety profile.   Other agents, such as targeted therapy (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) and immunother- apy, are more selective in destroying cancerous cells and avoiding the heart, which paves the way for creating more selective cancer treatment options that will not sacrifice the heart alongside the malignancy. Figure 2 summarizes the key pharmacologic and non- pharmacologic interventions for reducing HR in cancer patients.   5. Knowledge Gaps and Further Research   Studies evaluating the association between elevated resting HR and the risk of ACVOs in cancer patients are scarce [38–40]. Most studies have concentrated on specific cancer types, namely lung, breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, due to their high prevalence and associated mortality rates [38–40]. Only one study analyzed ECG-detected resting sinus tachycardia cumulatively in all types of cancer and described specific ACVOs [13]. Unfortunately, most studies mentioned the difficulty in addressing the precise cause of death in cancer patients due the complexity of the clinical picture and the rarity of autopsies   performed, since the majority often die at home or in hospice care [24,39]. Some patients with cancer and chemotherapy-induced severe cardiomyopathy have increased mortality if they do not improve on guideline-directed medical therapy and do not have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator [73]. Further, some arrhythmias including premature ventricular contractions can lead to ASCOs [74]. Consequently, it would be hard to predict the true impact of elevated HR on the development of ACVOs, as many patients die before ACVOs manifest, or the cause of death might be due to a cardiovascular deficit which would not be captured post-mortem.   Also, it is a possibility that the resting sinus tachycardia observed in cancer patients could be a byproduct of the tumor burden, whether it be from the widespread systemic inflammation or the hypermetabolic state caused by the cancer itself. This poses a serious question of whether treating resting sinus tachycardia in this patient population would mute the compensatory response intentionally generated by the body. On the other hand, Anker et al. found that resting heart rate was not related to cancer stage; hence, terminal disease is not a prerequisite for resting sinus tachycardia [24,38]. Also, no research is avail- able to suggest whether asymptomatic resting sinus tachycardia should be treated, besides advising for the standard life-style modifications. And no studies are available to suggest whether treating asymptomatic tachycardia would affect morbidity and mortality. The aforementioned is not described for the general CVD population, let alone cancer patients. Lastly, cancer patients are a vulnerable population with an already increased risk of cardiovascular compromise, so addressing cardiovascular parameters here cannot just rely on studies extrapolated from the general population. Hence, this subject is a prominent gap in the literature with a crucial need for further investigation.   Resting sinus tachycardia is a complex phenomenon with a multifactorial etiology and prominent clinical and prognostic implications on cancer patient health and survival. It is a real clinical challenge and therefore necessitates comprehensive diagnostic approaches and treatment guidelines. It can stem from the effect of the tumor burden, wide-spread inflammation, treatment-related toxicity, comorbidities, and psychological stress. Adequate management involves utilizing both pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy, man- aging underlying conditions, switching or adjusting cancer treatments to involve more cardio-neutral formulations, and optimizing the quality of life, with a patient-centered and holistic multidisciplinary approach. This review focused on providing a scope of the available evidence on resting sinus tachycardia in cancer patients while focusing on its impact on ACVOs and overall survival, as well as providing a basic understanding of the accessible therapeutic options. However, it is crucial to have new and ongoing research to better grasp the pathophysiology and thus develop more targeted therapeutic strategies beyond the mainstream BBs. Establishing evidence-based guidelines to treat resting sinus tachycardia in cancer patients is one step closer towards achieving better clinical outcomes and optimizing cancer care.",

         "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and globally affects both genders. The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area’s worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease’s onset. The findings underline the potential of machine learning to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and therapy planning while emphasizing the importance of interpretability and transparency in artificial intelligence-based healthcare systems.",

For example, NVIDIA introduced\nhardware-accelerated asynchronous memory copies [3]. The\nCUDA programmer can provide a “copy descriptor” of a ten-\nsor to copy and the hardware will run ahead and generate\nthe corresponding addresses in a Tensor Memory Unit.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe common denominator of all these works is that they\nrely on either the programmer or the compiler to decouple\naddress-generating instructions from the rest of the program.\nHowever, it has long been recognized that such a decoupling\nis not always possible [9, 57]. If any of the address-generating\ninstructions for array A depend on a value loaded from A,\nthen there is a loss-of-decoupling (LoD) [25]. Access patterns\nsuch as A[f(A[i])] are rare, but control dependencies that\ninvolve loads from A are common. For example, consider\nreplacing C[i] with A[i] in our running example:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\nA[idx[i]] = f(A[idx[i]]);\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHere, there is a LoD, because the A store is control-dependent\non a branch that loads from A. Whereas before the load from\nC could be prefetched, now the AGU/DU communication is\nsynchronized, because the AGU waits for A values from the\nDU before deciding if a store address should be generated,\nas shown in Figure 1b. In turn, the load waits for the store\naddress to ensure that there is no aliasing—the store address\nis needed for memory disambiguation. As a result, the AGU\ncannot run ahead of the CU anymore, resulting in decreased\npipeline parallelism, which Figure 2 illustrates.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOne approach for restoring decoupling in this case is con-\ntrol speculation. As shown in Figure 1c, we can hoist the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nstore request out of the if -condition in the AGU (specula-\ntion), and later poison the store in the CU on mis-speculation\n(store invalidation). However, it is unclear how the compiler\nshould coordinate the speculation and recovery transfor-\nmations across two distinct control-flow graphs. While the\nexample from Figure 1c is trivial, the task quickly becomes\ncomplicated with more speculated stores and nested control\nflow, as we demonstrate in the next section. The key chal-\nlenge here is to guarantee that the order of store requests\nsent from the AGU matches the order of store values or kill\nsignals sent from the CU on all control-flow paths.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nGeneral compiler support for speculated stores in DAE\narchitectures is an open question that we tackle in this paper,\nmaking the following contributions:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n• We give a formal description of the fundamental rea-\nsons why address generation cannot always be decou-\npled from the rest of the program (§4).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n• We describe compiler support for speculative memory\nin DAE architectures, solving the LoD problem due\nto control dependencies. We propose two algorithms:\none for speculating memory requests in the AGU, and\none for poisoning mis-speculations in the CU (§5).\n• We prove that our speculation approach preserves the\nsequential consistency of the original program and\ndoes not introduce deadlocks (§6).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n• We show that our work enables DAE on a wider class\nof codes than before, with applications in CPU/GPU\nprefetchers, CGRAs, and FPGA accelerators.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n• We evaluate our DAE speculation approach on accel-\nerators generated from HLS implementing codes from\nthe graph and data analytics domain. We achieve an\naverage 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup over the baseline HLS\nimplementations. We show that our approach has no\nmis-speculation penalty and minimal code size impact\n(average accelerator area increase < 5%) (§8).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n2 Motivating Example\nIn this brief section, we show why an obvious approach to\nspeculation in DAE architectures is incorrect.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe FIFO-based nature of DAE requires that the order of\nmemory requests (speculative or not) generated in the AGU\nmatches exactly the order of load/store values (poisoned or\nnot) in the CU. The motivating example in Figure 1c contains\njust one speculative store and one path through the compute\nCFG where the speculation becomes unreachable, making\nthe problem of ordering trivial in that case.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nConsider the more complex code in Figure 3a with three\nstores 𝑠0, 𝑠1, and 𝑠2. Speculating all store requests in the AGU\nmight result in the store request order (𝑠2, 𝑠0, 𝑠1). In the CU,\nwe need to guarantee the same order of corresponding store\nvalues (poisoned or not) on every possible control-flow path\nthrough the loop. Unfortunately, the obvious approach that\nworked for the trivial example in Figure 1c does not work\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n(a) Code and control-flow graph of a loop with three control-\ndependent stores causing a loss-of-decoupling.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n(b) Depending on control flow, the order of store values can be:\n(𝑠2, 𝑠1, 𝑠0), (𝑠2, 𝑠0, 𝑠1), (𝑠0, 𝑠1, 𝑠2), but only (𝑠2, 𝑠0, 𝑠1) is correct.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFigure 3. Poisoning speculated stores immediately when\nthey become unreachable results in an ordering mismatch\nbetween AGU store requests from and CU store values.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nhere. If we poison values at points where the corresponding\nspeculation becomes unreachable, as illustrated in Figure 3b,\nthen we end up with three possible orderings of store values\ndepending on the CFG path in the CU, but only one of the\norderings is correct. This is why any previous implemen-\ntations of speculative stores in DAE architectures has only\nconsidered trivial triangle or diamond shaped CFGs [24], like\nthe one in Figure 1c. Generalized compiler support for store\nspeculation that guarantees the correct order of poisoning is\nthe key challenge that we solve in this paper.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3 Background\nIn this section, we describe the architectural support needed\nto enable speculative DAE and some compiler preliminaries.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n3.1 Architectural Support\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOur speculation technique requires architectural support for\npredicated stores and FIFOs. Store values are tagged with\na poison bit that, when set, causes the corresponding store\nrequest to be dropped in the DU without committing a store.\nWe say that a store request gets killed (or poisoned) if its\ncorresponding store value has the poison bit set. This is a\nlightweight form of speculation that does not require replays\nin the CU and does not result in out-of-bounds stores, be-\ncause mis-speculated stores are never committed. Speculative\nloads can be supported by simply discarding the value of a\nmis-speculated load.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nPredicated stores are easy to support in hardware since\nthe underlying memory protocol usually already uses a valid\nsignal. For example, the commonly used AXI4 interface\n[4] has a strobe signal to indicate which bytes are valid.\nArchitectural FIFOs (queues) are also commonly added in\nworks on CPU/GPU microarchitecture or can be relatively\ncheaply implemented in software. For example, works on\nDAE CPU/GPU prefetchers add architectural FIFOs and ex-\ntend the ISA with instructions for producing load/store ad-\ndresses and consuming/producing store values [3, 5, 17, 18,\n24, 38, 47].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe prefetcher from [24] enables predicated stores with a\nstore_inv instruction, but the authors support only simple\ntriangle or diamond control flow patterns, calling for future\nwork on general speculation support. We discuss concrete ex-\namples of architectures that can benefit from our work in §7.\nWe evaluate our work on accelerators generated from HLS,\nwhere we have complete control of the memory interfaces.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n3.2 Compiler Preliminaries\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe use an SSA-based compiler representation and associated\nanalyses [49]. In particular, we use the control-flow graph\nand dominator tree to calculate control dependencies [40],\nand we use the SSA def-use chain for data dependencies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe use a canonical loop representation: loops have a sin-\ngle header block and a single loop backedge going from the\nloop latch to the loop header. Our transformation assumes re-\nducible control flow—CFG edges can be partitioned into two\ndisjoint sets, forward and back edges, such that the forward\nedges form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Irreducible con-\ntrol flow can be made reducible with node splitting [7, 44].\nFor completeness, we briefly describe how our compiler\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nimplements a DAE architecture:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n1. AGU: For each memory operation to be decoupled,\nwe change it to a send_ld_addr or a send_st_addr\nfunction that sends the memory address to the DU.\n2. CU: Dually, in the CU we change each decoupled mem-\nory operation to a consume_val or produce_val func-\ntion that receives or sends values to or from the DU.\n3. Dead Code Elimination: We run a standard DCE\npass in the CU to remove the now unnecessary address\ngeneration code. In the AGU, we delete all side effect\ninstructions that are not part of the address generation\ndef-use chains, and then also run a standard DCE pass.\nWe also use a control-flow simplification pass that\nremoves empty blocks potentially created by DCE.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe send_ld_addr, send_st_addr, consume_val, and\nproduce_val functions are implementation dependent. For\nexample, if we target CPU/GPU prefetchers, such as [17, 24],\nthen these would translate to instructions. For accelerators,\nthey would be translated to FIFO writes/reads.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n4 Loss-of-Decoupling Analysis\nLoD events arise when the address generation for a given\nmemory access depends on a load that cannot be trivially\nprefetched, causing the AGU, DU, and CU communication\nto be synchronized. By non-trivially prefetched we mean\nloads that have a RAW hazards, i.e., the DU needs to receive\nall previous store addresses in program order to perform\nmemory disambiguation before executing the load.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nGiven a set of address-generating instructions 𝐺, and a set\nof memory load instructions 𝐴 using addresses generated by\ninstructions in 𝐺, there is a loss of decoupling if:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDefinition 4.1 (LoD Data Dependency). There exists a\npath in the def-use chain from 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 to 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺. While en-\ncountering a 𝜙-node on the def-use chain leading to 𝑔, we\nalso trace the def-use paths of the terminator instructions 𝑇\nin the 𝜙-node incoming basic blocks to see if any terminator\ninstruction in 𝑇 depends on any 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDefinition 4.2 (LoD Control Dependency). There exists\nan instruction 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺 that is control-dependent on a branch\ninstruction 𝑏, and there is a path in the def-use chain from 𝑎 ∈\n𝐴 to 𝑏. We call the basic block that contains 𝑏 the LoD control\ndependency source. Note that the LoD control dependency\nsource need not be the immediate control dependency of 𝑔,\nand that 𝑔 might have multiple LoD control dependencies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nDepending on the hardware context, the definition of the 𝐴\nset can be expanded or narrowed. For example, if the AGU is\nimplemented in hardware with limited control flow support,\nthen 𝐴 could include all branch instructions. On the other\nhand, given an address generating instruction, we could limit\n𝐴 to only include loads from the same array for which the\ngiven address is generated—this could be useful if we only\nwant to preserve decoupling for that array and do not care\nabout losing decoupling for other arrays. Our speculation\ntechnique applies equally well to all these definitions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAn example of a LoD data dependency is the A[f(A[i])]\naccess. Our speculation approach does not recover decou-\npling for such cases, but fortunately such accesses are rare.\nAn example of a more common LoD data dependency is the\ncode pattern if (A[i]) A[i++] = 1. In this case, the def-use\nchain leading to the definition of the store address contains\na 𝜙-node (i) whose value depends on loading from 𝐴. Such a\npattern is sometimes found in algorithms that operate on dy-\nnamically growing data structures, e.g. queues or stacks. Our\nspeculation technique does not work on such cases either,\nbut this is not a large limitation, since performance oriented\ncodes typically do not use dynamically growing structures,\ninstead opting for implementations with bounded space re-\nquirements that can be allocated statically [62].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAn example of LoD due to a control dependency is shown\nin Figure 1b.

Given a LoD control dependency source\nblock 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 we hoist all memory requests that are control de-\npendent on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the end of 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. There can be multiple\nblocks with memory requests that have a LoD control depen-\ndency on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵, which poses the question in which order\nshould they be hoisted to 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. We use reverse post-order\nin Algorithm 1.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAssuming reducible control flow, the CFG region from\n𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch is a DAG. The reverse post-order of\na DAG is its topological order. Topological ordering gives us\nthe useful property that given two distinct basic blocks 𝐴\nand 𝐵 in a given loop, if 𝐴 ≺ 𝐵 in any path through the loop\nthen 𝐴 ≺ 𝐵 in the topological ordering. Note that there can\nbe multiple topological orderings for a DAG, but it does not\nmatter which one is chosen in our algorithm.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAlgorithm 1 traverses the CFG region from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the\nend of its loop (or to the end of the function if 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 is\nnot in a loop). During the traversal, we ignore CFG edges\nleading to loop headers—we do not enter loops other than\nthe innermost loop containing 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n5.1.1 Example of Hoisting. Consider the CFG from Fig-\nure 4a. There are three LoD control dependency source\nblocks (2, 3, 5) and five blocks with memory requests (blocks\n2, 4, 5, 6, 7 with requests 𝑎, 𝑐, 𝑏, 𝑑, 𝑒, respectively). Assume that\neach block holds a single memory request—multiple memory\nrequests within the same block are treated in the same way\nby our algorithms. Figure 4c shows the topological order of\nthe loop (block 1 is omitted for brevity). Algorithm 1 will\nhoist 𝑏, 𝑒 to the end of block 2, and 𝑐, 𝑑, 𝑒 to the end of block\n3—the result is presented in Figure 4b. Note that the requests\n𝑏 and 𝑒 were hoisted to both block 2 and 3, because they are\nreachable from both blocks. Nothing is hoisted to block 1\nsince it is not a LoD control dependency source.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 4.

Consider, for example, the requests 𝑏 and 𝑐 in Fig-\nure 4a. We first want to hoist 𝑐 to block 3 before hoisting 𝑏,\nbecause there exists a CFG path where 𝑐 comes before 𝑏, but\nnot vice versa. If 𝑏 were hoisted before 𝑐, then the speculative\nrequests order would be 𝑏 ≺ 𝑐, which would be impossible\nto match with values in the CU on the CFG path 3, 5, 7.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nfor 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ∈ 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ do\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\nfor 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 do\nif 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 then\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\n𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠.𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒 (𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵)\nbreak\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n⊲ to the next edge\nif 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 not reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 then\n⊲ reachability ignores loop backedges\npoison 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 requests on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ⊲ Alg. 3\n𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠.𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒 (𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n5.2 Poisoning Mis-speculated Stores\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOur strategy for poisoning misspeculations in the CU is to\nfirst map a poison call to a CFG edge, and then to map that\nedge to a poison store call contained in an existing or newly\ncreated basic block.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAlgorithm 2 describes the first step. Given block 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵\nthat contains speculative memory requests 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠, we\nconsider each path in the DAG from the 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop\nlatch (or function exit) in the CU. We call the block where\na 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 becomes true the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 (for example,\nthe 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 for request 𝑏 in Figure 4a is block 5). For each\nCFG path, we use the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 list to keep track of which\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nrequests were already used or poisoned on the path—the list\ncontains the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 for each 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nGiven an edge in the traversal, the edge is skipped if the\nnext 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 is still reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 .\nThis guarantees that the order of speculative requests in the\nAGU matches the order of values in the CU, i.e., a speculative\nrequest for a given 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 block is not poisoned immedi-\nately when 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 becomes unreachable if there is an earlier\nspeculative request that can still be used.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n5.2.1 Example of Mapping Poison Stores to CFG Edges.\nFigure 4c shows which CFG edges are poisoned given the\noriginal CFG in Figure 4a and the AGU CFG in Figure 4b.

Algo-\nrithm 3 shows how poisoned CFG edges are mapped to actual\npoison calls placed in a concrete basic block. Given a poi-\nsoned request 𝑟 on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 (from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 block to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 block),\nthe 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 block where 𝑟 was speculated in the AGU, and\n𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 where r becomes true there are three cases:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n1. There exists a path from 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . In this\ncase, we cannot insert 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , because\nwe would end up with a CFG path where the store is\nboth true and poisoned. To avoid this, we create a new\n𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to it.\n2. There exists a path from the loop header to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡\nthat does not contain 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵. In this case, we cannot\ninsert 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , because we would end up\nwith a CFG path where 𝑟 was not speculated in the\nAGU, but was poisoned in the CU. To avoid this, we\ncreate a new block 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 on the edge and append\n𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to it. We also add steering instructions to the\npath from 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 that will branch from\n𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 only if 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 was encountered\non the current CFG path.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3.

Since\nthere is a path from the true block of 𝑐 (block 4) to the edge\ndestination block (block 5), we create a new block on the\n3 → 5 edge and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) to it.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nCase 2: Store 𝑑 is poisoned on both the 5 → 7 and 5 → 𝐿\nedges. The 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 for 𝑑 is block 3. Since there exists the path\n𝐻 → 1 → 2 → 5 that does not contain block 3, we create\na new block on the 5 → 7 edge with the 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑑) call. We\nadd steering instructions to the 3 → 5 and 3 → 4 → 5 paths\nthat will cause block 5 to branch to the new poison block\non the 5 → 7 edge only if block 5 was reached from a path\ncontaining block 3.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nCase 3: Store 𝑐 is also poisoned on the 3 → 6 edge, but\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nhere it is safe to prepend 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) to the start of block 6.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n5.3 Merging Poison Blocks\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nCase 1 and 2 of Algorithm 3 might create multiple poison\nblocks for the same store on different CFG edges. It is possible\nto merge two poison blocks into one if they contain the\nsame list of poison stores and if they have the same list of\nimmediate successors. When merging, we keep instructions\nfrom just one block. We apply such merging iteratively after\nAlgorithms 2 and 3. For example, Figure 5 contains a CFG sub-\nregion of our running example from Figure 4. Algorithm 3\ninserted poison blocks 10, 11, 12, 13 to poison stores 𝑑 and 𝑒.\nBlock pairs (11, 13) and (10, 12) can be merged.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n5.4 Speculative Load Consumption\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSpeculative loads are relatively easy to support. To match\nthe order of load_consume calls in the CU with the order\nof speculative send_load_addr calls in the AGU we can\nhoist the load_consume calls to the same block where the\ncorresponding send_load_addr were hoisted in the AGU.\nThen, the CU can either use the load value or discard it.\nAfter hoisting, we need to update all 𝜙 instructions that use\nthe load value, since the basic block containing the loaded\nvalue will have changed. Alternatively, we can transform 𝜙\ninstructions using the load value into select instructions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n6 Safety and Liveness\nWe prove that our transformations preserve the sequential\nconsistency of the original program and that they do not\nintroduce deadlock. Deadlock freedom is a corollary of se-\nquential consistency, so we focus only on the latter. We\nshow that on every CFG path the order of speculative store\nrequests in the AGU matches the order of store values in the\nCU, and that the non-poisoned store value sequence in the\nCU matches the store sequence of the original code.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn the following discussion, we assume blocks with a sin-\ngle store; the proof trivially extends to blocks with multi-\nple stores since all speculative stores in the same block are\ntreated the same. We also assume that all stores are specula-\ntive, since the relative order between non-speculative and\nspeculative stores is guaranteed by definition: given a a non-\nspeculative store 𝑠1 and a speculative store 𝑠2, Algorithm 1\nwill not change the relative program order of 𝑠1 and 𝑠2, i.e., if\n𝑠1 ≺ 𝑠2 in the original program order, then it is not possible\nto hoist 𝑠2 such that 𝑠2 ≺ 𝑠1. This follows from the con-\ntrol dependency definition (§4)—𝑠2 hoisting stops at its LoD\ncontrol dependency source 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵, which must come after\nthe block containing 𝑠1 in topological order. If 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 would\ncome after 𝑠1 in topological order, then the block containing\n𝑠1 would also have a LoD control dependency on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 and\nwould have been hoisted, which is a contradiction since we\nassumed that 𝑠1 was non-speculative. A similar argument\ncan be made if 𝑠2 ≺ 𝑠1 in the original program.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nLemma 6.1 (Sequential Consistency). Given an ordered list\nof 𝑛 speculative store requests 𝐿𝑎 = {𝑎0, 𝑎1, ..., 𝑎𝑛−1} made\nin the AGU loop CFG on some fixed iteration 𝑘, Algorithms\n2 and 3 transform the CU CFG such that every possible\npath through its loop CFG on iteration 𝑘 produces an or-\ndered list of 𝑛 tagged store values 𝐿𝑣 = {(𝑣0, 𝑝0), (𝑣1, 𝑝1), ...,\n(𝑣𝑛−1, 𝑝𝑛−1)}, such that each (𝑎𝑖, 𝑣𝑖, 𝑝𝑖 ), 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛 triple cor-\nresponds to a 𝐴[𝑎𝑖 ] ← 𝑣𝑖 store in the original program CFG,\nand 𝑝𝑖 = 1 (poison bit) if that store is not executed on the\npath through the original loop CFG on iteration 𝑘.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nProof. We use a proof by induction on the transformed CFG.\nBase case: 𝐿𝑎 = ∅ (no speculated requests in the AGU).\nAlgorithm 2 does not change the CU CFG. Thus, the order\nof store addresses in the AGU and store values in the CU\ntrivially matches, 𝐿𝑎 = 𝐿𝑣 = ∅.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nInductive hypothesis: assume Lemma 6.1 holds at basic\nblock 𝐵𝑖 in the current CFG path. All store requests 𝑎 𝑗 ∈\n𝐿𝑎 contained in blocks reached before 𝐵𝑖 in the path were\nmatched with the correct store value call (𝑣 𝑗, 𝑝 𝑗 ) ∈ 𝐿𝑣, such\nthat 𝑝 𝑗 = 1 if 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗 ] ← 𝑣 𝑗 was not executed on the path in\nthe original loop CFG.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nInductive step: The next store address in the AGU 𝐿𝑎 se-\nquence is 𝑎 𝑗+1 ∈ 𝐿𝑎. The next store value in the CU CFG\npath should be (𝑣 𝑗+1, 𝑝 𝑗+1) ∈ 𝐿𝑣, where 𝑝 𝑗+1 = 1 iff the\nstore 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗+1] ← 𝑣 𝑗+1 is not reached on the current CFG\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\npath in the original program. Algorithm 2 considers the\n𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 → 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 next. There are three cases:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n1. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵, where 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is the block contain-\ning the store 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗+1] ← 𝑣 𝑗+1 in the original program\nCFG. In this case, Algorithm 2 will not poison this\nstore on this path through the CU CFG, i.e., the next\nitem in the 𝐿𝑣 sequence will be the correct (𝑣 𝑗, 0).\n2. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 ≠ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is not reachable from\n𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , in which case Algorithm 2 will insert a poison\nstore on this edge. Algorithm 3 will map this poison\nstore to a basic block, with the effect that taking the\n𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 will result in the poison call being executed and\ncontrol transferring to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . The next item in the\n𝐿𝑣 sequence will be the correct (𝑣 𝑗, 1).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n3. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 ≠ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is reachable from 𝐵𝑙 , in\nwhich case Algorithm 2 will traverse the path until\nCase 1 or 2 is matched.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSince Lemma 6.1 holds for the base case, for basic blocks\non the path up to 𝐵𝑖 , and for some successor block of 𝐵𝑖 , it\nmust hold at any block on the path. If it holds at any block\non the path, it holds for the whole path. Since a given store\nrequest 𝑟 is poisoned at most once on a given CFG edge\nand since, by definition of Algorithm 2, any given path will\ncontain at most one edge where 𝑟 is poisoned, we conclude\n□\nthat Lemma 6.1 holds for all paths.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n7 Applications\nIn this section, we highlight three applications for our work:\nDAE-based prefetchers in CPUs/GPUs, CGRAs, and special-\nized accelerators generated from HLS. In the next section,\nwe choose HLS as an evaluation vehicle due to its simplicity\ncompared to CPU/GPU prefetchers where the evaluation\nresults can easily be polluted by other architectural factors\nlike cache behavior, branch prediction, etc. However, we em-\nphasize that our speculation support in DAE does not rely\non any HLS-specific features and can be applied wherever\nspeculation is combined with the DAE technique.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n7.1 CPU/GPU Prefetchers\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nMost existing works on CPU/GPU prefetchers follow the\nDAE principle and rely on the compiler to decoupled address\ngeneration from compute [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47]. All of these\nworks suffer from the control-dependency loss of decoupling\n(LoD) problem (§4). The work in [24] discusses adding spec-\nulation and predicated stores to the CPU microarchitecture\nto mitigate LoD, but their compiler only supports simple\ndiamond and triangle control flow shapes. In this paper, we\nhave demonstrated generalized compiler support for specu-\nlation in DAE, making these works viable for general control\nflow and thus applicable to a broader set of codes.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n7.1.1 Example.

A CGRA compiler is typically\nco-designed with the hardware, as the PEs are typically stat-\nically scheduled. The job of the compiler is to map the Con-\ntrol/Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to the PEs, and many works\nfollow the DAE technique to tackle the memory wall prob-\nlem [20, 27, 37, 39, 43, 45, 46, 61].

The CGRA proposed in [39] is an example\nof a modern streaming dataflow CGRA. All communication\nin the CGRA is FIFO-based, and address generation is ex-\nplicitly decoupled at compile time into AGUs. The compiler\ngenerates commands to produce address streams, and to\nconsume or produce values. Control flow is handled with\npredication and there is a SD_Clean_Port command to throw\naway a value from an output port that can be used to imple-\nment predicated stores.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n7.3 High-Level Synthesis\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn HLS, the CDFG of an algorithm is implemented directly\nin hardware following a spatial execution model with the\nfreedom to customize the memory system.

Many research works\nin academia and industry have exploited DAE in HLS to\nimprove the efficiency of HLS-generated accelerators for ir-\nregular codes [11–13, 15, 16, 21, 53–55]. By adding compiler\nspeculation support, DAE in HLS can be used on a broader\nset of codes, which we demonstrate in the next section.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n8 Evaluation\nIn this section, we answer the following questions:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• What is the performance benefit of using a DAE ar-\nchitecture (enabled by our speculation approach) to\naccelerate codes with LoD control dependencies?\n• What is the cost of mis-speculation in our approach?\n• What is the impact on code size (accelerator area usage)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nof our speculation approach?\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n• What is the scalability for nested control flow, which\nincreases the number of poison stores and blocks?\nWe make our work and evaluation publicly available [52].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFigure 6.

Our SPEC approach gives on average a 1.9× (and up\nto 3×) speedup over STA. This is within 5% of the ORACLE\nperformance. In contrast, DAE without speculation sees a\ndramatic performance degradation over STA, because the\nAGU, DU, CU communication is sequentialized.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n8.2.1 Mis-speculation Cost. The SPEC and ORACLE per-\nformance gap is highest on the bfs and bc codes, because of\nits deep pipeline between the load and store that form a RAW\nhazard. The deep pipeline means that more store allocations\nneed to be held by the LSQ to guarantee perfect pipelining\n[34]. This, together with a high mis-speculation rate in these\nbenchmarks (Table 1), can cause the LSQ to fill with store\naddresses that are mis-speculated, potentially stalling later\nloads that have to wait for future store addresses to arrive.\nThis problem can be solved by increasing the store queue size\nin the LSQ. The increased number of requests and the need\nfor more buffering is one of the limitations of our approach.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nCodes with a shallower pipeline that do not need large LSQ\nsizes have no mis-speculation penalty.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo prove this, we choose three benchmarks where we\ncan instrument the input data so that we can vary the mis-\nspeculation rate. Table 2 shows how the mis-speculation\ncost changes as the mis-speculation rate increases. As can\nbe seen, there is no correlation between the mis-speculation\nrate and cost, with the slight variability in clock cycle counts\nattributable to the subtle difference in the number of true\nRAW hazards due to the varying data distribution.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTable 2.

In HLS, an increased number of blocks can result in a\nhigher area usage due to larger scheduler complexity [50].\nTable 1 shows the absolute area usage of all accelerators.\nWe observe virtually no area overhead of SPEC over ORACLE\non the evaluated benchmarks. This is because most of the\ncodes have at most two control-flow nesting levels where\nnew poison blocks are inserted, and sometimes it is possible\nto reduce the number of blocks using our merging technique\n(e.g., two poison blocks in mm merged into one).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n8.3.1 Impact of Nested Control Flow on Area Usage.\nTo give a more meaningful measure of how nested control\nflow impacts the area overhead of our SPEC approach, we\ncreate a synthetic benchmark template where we can tune\nthe number of poison blocks generated by SPEC:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nfor HLS with speculation support [23]. The speculation sup-\nport in this and other works requires costly recovery on\nmis-speculation [6, 22, 30, 35, 56, 60]. Efficiently squashing\nspeculative computation on the wrong paths in a spatial\ndataflow architecture is hard, because the architectural state\nis distributed [10]. Our speculative DAE sidesteps this issue,\nnot requiring any recovery: we speculate early (run ahead)\nin the AGU, and later handle mis-speculations in the CU by\ntaking an appropriate path in its CFG.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nControl-flow handling in GPUs is usually implemented\nvia predication. The algorithms used to calculate predicate\nmasks and re-convergence points resemble our work [32].\nThe SIMT stack approach in GPUs pushes predicate masks\nonto a stack when entering a control-flow nesting level, and\npops when exiting. Our Algorithm 1 implementing specula-\ntive requests can be seen as a pass through the CFG with only\npush operations, where the push is onto individual stacks of\ncontrol-dependency sources. Dually, our inserting of poison\ncalls in Algorithm 1 can be seen as a pass through the CFG\nwith only pop operations where the placement of the pops\nfollows a certain policy just like modern SIMT compilers fol-\nlow different policies to prevent SIMT deadlock and livelock,\nor to improve performance [19], instead of popping at the\nimmediate post-dominator.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n10 Conclusion\nWe have presented general compiler support for specula-\ntive memory operations in DAE architectures that tackles\nthe LoD problem resulting from control dependencies. We\nhave proposed CFG transformations implementing specula-\ntion in the address generation slice, and poisoning of mis-\nspeculations in the compute slice, with a proof of correctness.\nWe have presented three applications where our work im-\nproves support for the efficient execution of irregular codes:\nDAE-based CPU/GPU prefetchers that require compiler sup-\nport, CGRA architectures, and HLS-generated specialized\naccelerators. We have evaluated our work on HLS-generated\naccelerators, showing an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup\nover non-DAE accelerators on a set of irregular benchmarks\nwhere DAE is not possible without our speculation. Our ap-\nproach has no mis-speculation cost and a small code size\nfootprint, scaling well to deeply nested control flow.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFuture work could investigate vector-parallelism support\nby filling a vector of speculative requests in the AGU and\nproducing a store mask in the CU, similar to the recent work\non decoupled vector runahead prefetching in CPUs [36].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nData-Availability Statement\nWe make our work and evaluation publicly available [52].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Intel for access to FPGAs through their DevCloud.\nThis work was supported by a UK EPSRC PhD scholarship.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFigure 7.

The area overhead of the AGU unit\nis similarly close to 0%, because SPEC hoists stores out of\nthe if -conditions, causing the blocks to be deleted. The area\noverhead of the CU unit grows by a few percent (< 5%)\nwith each added poison block, but even for the pathological\ncase of eight nested if -conditions the overhead is below 25%.\nIn real codes, with more compute and lower control-flow\nnesting, the area overhead of SPEC should be minimal.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n9 Related Work\nProgram slicing is used beyond DAE architectures. Decoupled\nSoftware Pipelining (DSWP) [41] is a popular transforma-\ntion that decouples strongly connected components in the\nprogram dependence graph into separate pipeline stages\nmapped over multiple PEs communicating via FIFOs. The\nPEs can be CPU threads, or pipeline stages in an accelerator\ngenerated by HLS [33]. Control dependent pipeline stages in\nDSWP can also be executed speculatively, although stages\nwith memory operations require versioned memory [58].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nControl speculation has its roots in compilers for VLIW ma-\nchines. Instruction scheduling in HLS is very similar to VLIW\nscheduling (no hardware support for speculation, static map-\nping to functional units, etc.), with many algorithms like\nmodulo-scheduling and if -conversion originally developed\nfor VLIW directly applicable to HLS [2, 42, 50].

Decoupled access/execute (DAE) is a common technique to tackle this problem. It relies on the compiler to separate memory address generation from the rest of the program, however, such a separation is not always possible due to control and data dependencies between the access and execute slices, resulting in a loss of decoupling.   In this paper, we present compiler support for speculation in DAE architectures that preserves decoupling in the face of control dependencies. We speculate memory requests in the access slice and poison mis-speculations in the execute slice without the need for replays or synchronization. Our transformation works on arbitrary, reducible control flow and is proven to preserve sequential consistency. We show that our approach applies to a wide range of architectural work on CPU/GPU prefetchers, CGRAs, and accelerators, enabling DAE on a wider range of codes than before.   CCS Concepts: • Hardware → Emerging languages and compilers; • Software and its engineering → Compilers.   Keywords: decoupled access/execute; compiler speculation   1 Introduction Irregular codes are characterized by data-dependent memory accesses and control flow, for example:   Figure 1. A decoupled access/execute architecture template.   This code has unpredictable control flow that causes frequent branch mis-predictions on CPUs and thread divergence on GPUs. Because of these limitations, and challenges with Moore’s Law and Dennard performance scaling, computer architects are interested in adding CPU/GPU structures to accelerate such code patterns, or even to use accelerators specialized for a given algorithm [26].   Many of the proposed architectures follow the decades-old idea of a Decoupled Access/Execute (DAE) architecture shown in Figure 1. In DAE, memory accesses are decoupled from computation to avoid stalls resulting from unpredictable loads [51]. The address generation unit (AGU) sends load and store requests to the data unit (DU), while the DU sends load values to and receives store values from the compute unit (CU). All communication is FIFO based and ideally the AGU to DU communication is one-directional, allowing the   Figure 2. Comparison of a decoupled and non-decoupled address generation. Non-decoupled address generation re- sults in a later arrival of the store address, which stalls the RAW check for the next load, lowering load throughput.   address streams from the AGU to run ahead w.r.t the CU. Figure 1a shows an example of such a DAE architecture implementing the earlier code snippet.   DAE is a general technique applicable to many computa- tional models: it is used in specialized FPGA accelerators gen- erated from High-Level Synthesis (HLS) [11–13, 15, 16, 21, 54, 55]; in Coarse Grain Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) [20, 27, 37, 39, 43, 45, 46, 61]; and in CPU/GPU prefetchers [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47, 59]. For example, NVIDIA introduced hardware-accelerated asynchronous memory copies [3]. The CUDA programmer can provide a “copy descriptor” of a ten- sor to copy and the hardware will run ahead and generate the corresponding addresses in a Tensor Memory Unit.   The common denominator of all these works is that they rely on either the programmer or the compiler to decouple address-generating instructions from the rest of the program. However, it has long been recognized that such a decoupling is not always possible [9, 57]. If any of the address-generating instructions for array A depend on a value loaded from A, then there is a loss-of-decoupling (LoD) [25]. Access patterns such as A[f(A[i])] are rare, but control dependencies that involve loads from A are common. For example, consider replacing C[i] with A[i] in our running example:   Here, there is a LoD, because the A store is control-dependent on a branch that loads from A. Whereas before the load from C could be prefetched, now the AGU/DU communication is synchronized, because the AGU waits for A values from the DU before deciding if a store address should be generated, as shown in Figure 1b. In turn, the load waits for the store address to ensure that there is no aliasing—the store address is needed for memory disambiguation. As a result, the AGU cannot run ahead of the CU anymore, resulting in decreased pipeline parallelism, which Figure 2 illustrates.   One approach for restoring decoupling in this case is con- trol speculation. As shown in Figure 1c, we can hoist the   store request out of the if -condition in the AGU (specula- tion), and later poison the store in the CU on mis-speculation (store invalidation). However, it is unclear how the compiler should coordinate the speculation and recovery transfor- mations across two distinct control-flow graphs. While the example from Figure 1c is trivial, the task quickly becomes complicated with more speculated stores and nested control flow, as we demonstrate in the next section. The key chal- lenge here is to guarantee that the order of store requests sent from the AGU matches the order of store values or kill signals sent from the CU on all control-flow paths.   General compiler support for speculated stores in DAE architectures is an open question that we tackle in this paper, making the following contributions:   • We give a formal description of the fundamental rea- sons why address generation cannot always be decou- pled from the rest of the program (§4).   • We describe compiler support for speculative memory in DAE architectures, solving the LoD problem due to control dependencies. We propose two algorithms: one for speculating memory requests in the AGU, and one for poisoning mis-speculations in the CU (§5). • We prove that our speculation approach preserves the sequential consistency of the original program and does not introduce deadlocks (§6).   • We show that our work enables DAE on a wider class of codes than before, with applications in CPU/GPU prefetchers, CGRAs, and FPGA accelerators.   • We evaluate our DAE speculation approach on accel- erators generated from HLS implementing codes from the graph and data analytics domain. We achieve an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup over the baseline HLS implementations. We show that our approach has no mis-speculation penalty and minimal code size impact (average accelerator area increase < 5%) (§8).   2 Motivating Example In this brief section, we show why an obvious approach to speculation in DAE architectures is incorrect.   The FIFO-based nature of DAE requires that the order of memory requests (speculative or not) generated in the AGU matches exactly the order of load/store values (poisoned or not) in the CU. The motivating example in Figure 1c contains just one speculative store and one path through the compute CFG where the speculation becomes unreachable, making the problem of ordering trivial in that case.   Consider the more complex code in Figure 3a with three stores 𝑠0, 𝑠1, and 𝑠2. Speculating all store requests in the AGU might result in the store request order (𝑠2, 𝑠0, 𝑠1). In the CU, we need to guarantee the same order of corresponding store values (poisoned or not) on every possible control-flow path through the loop. Unfortunately, the obvious approach that worked for the trivial example in Figure 1c does not work   Figure 3. Poisoning speculated stores immediately when they become unreachable results in an ordering mismatch between AGU store requests from and CU store values.   here. If we poison values at points where the corresponding speculation becomes unreachable, as illustrated in Figure 3b, then we end up with three possible orderings of store values depending on the CFG path in the CU, but only one of the orderings is correct. This is why any previous implemen- tations of speculative stores in DAE architectures has only considered trivial triangle or diamond shaped CFGs [24], like the one in Figure 1c. Generalized compiler support for store speculation that guarantees the correct order of poisoning is the key challenge that we solve in this paper.   3 Background In this section, we describe the architectural support needed to enable speculative DAE and some compiler preliminaries.   Our speculation technique requires architectural support for predicated stores and FIFOs. Store values are tagged with a poison bit that, when set, causes the corresponding store request to be dropped in the DU without committing a store. We say that a store request gets killed (or poisoned) if its corresponding store value has the poison bit set. This is a lightweight form of speculation that does not require replays in the CU and does not result in out-of-bounds stores, be- cause mis-speculated stores are never committed. Speculative loads can be supported by simply discarding the value of a mis-speculated load.   Predicated stores are easy to support in hardware since the underlying memory protocol usually already uses a valid signal. For example, the commonly used AXI4 interface [4] has a strobe signal to indicate which bytes are valid. Architectural FIFOs (queues) are also commonly added in works on CPU/GPU microarchitecture or can be relatively cheaply implemented in software. For example, works on DAE CPU/GPU prefetchers add architectural FIFOs and ex- tend the ISA with instructions for producing load/store ad- dresses and consuming/producing store values [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47].   The prefetcher from [24] enables predicated stores with a store_inv instruction, but the authors support only simple triangle or diamond control flow patterns, calling for future work on general speculation support. We discuss concrete ex- amples of architectures that can benefit from our work in §7. We evaluate our work on accelerators generated from HLS, where we have complete control of the memory interfaces.   We use an SSA-based compiler representation and associated analyses [49]. In particular, we use the control-flow graph and dominator tree to calculate control dependencies [40], and we use the SSA def-use chain for data dependencies.   We use a canonical loop representation: loops have a sin- gle header block and a single loop backedge going from the loop latch to the loop header. Our transformation assumes re- ducible control flow—CFG edges can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, forward and back edges, such that the forward edges form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Irreducible con- trol flow can be made reducible with node splitting [7, 44]. For completeness, we briefly describe how our compiler   implements a DAE architecture:   1. AGU: For each memory operation to be decoupled, we change it to a send_ld_addr or a send_st_addr function that sends the memory address to the DU. 2. CU: Dually, in the CU we change each decoupled mem- ory operation to a consume_val or produce_val func- tion that receives or sends values to or from the DU. 3. Dead Code Elimination: We run a standard DCE pass in the CU to remove the now unnecessary address generation code. In the AGU, we delete all side effect instructions that are not part of the address generation def-use chains, and then also run a standard DCE pass. We also use a control-flow simplification pass that removes empty blocks potentially created by DCE.   The send_ld_addr, send_st_addr, consume_val, and produce_val functions are implementation dependent. For example, if we target CPU/GPU prefetchers, such as [17, 24], then these would translate to instructions. For accelerators, they would be translated to FIFO writes/reads.   4 Loss-of-Decoupling Analysis LoD events arise when the address generation for a given memory access depends on a load that cannot be trivially prefetched, causing the AGU, DU, and CU communication to be synchronized. By non-trivially prefetched we mean loads that have a RAW hazards, i.e., the DU needs to receive all previous store addresses in program order to perform memory disambiguation before executing the load.   Given a set of address-generating instructions 𝐺, and a set of memory load instructions 𝐴 using addresses generated by instructions in 𝐺, there is a loss of decoupling if:   Definition 4.1 (LoD Data Dependency). There exists a path in the def-use chain from 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 to 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺. While en- countering a 𝜙-node on the def-use chain leading to 𝑔, we also trace the def-use paths of the terminator instructions 𝑇 in the 𝜙-node incoming basic blocks to see if any terminator instruction in 𝑇 depends on any 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴.   Definition 4.2 (LoD Control Dependency). There exists an instruction 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺 that is control-dependent on a branch instruction 𝑏, and there is a path in the def-use chain from 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 to 𝑏. We call the basic block that contains 𝑏 the LoD control dependency source. Note that the LoD control dependency source need not be the immediate control dependency of 𝑔, and that 𝑔 might have multiple LoD control dependencies.   Depending on the hardware context, the definition of the 𝐴 set can be expanded or narrowed. For example, if the AGU is implemented in hardware with limited control flow support, then 𝐴 could include all branch instructions. On the other hand, given an address generating instruction, we could limit 𝐴 to only include loads from the same array for which the given address is generated—this could be useful if we only want to preserve decoupling for that array and do not care about losing decoupling for other arrays. Our speculation technique applies equally well to all these definitions.   An example of a LoD data dependency is the A[f(A[i])] access. Our speculation approach does not recover decou- pling for such cases, but fortunately such accesses are rare. An example of a more common LoD data dependency is the code pattern if (A[i]) A[i++] = 1. In this case, the def-use chain leading to the definition of the store address contains a 𝜙-node (i) whose value depends on loading from 𝐴. Such a pattern is sometimes found in algorithms that operate on dy- namically growing data structures, e.g. queues or stacks. Our speculation technique does not work on such cases either, but this is not a large limitation, since performance oriented codes typically do not use dynamically growing structures, instead opting for implementations with bounded space re- quirements that can be allocated statically [62].   An example of LoD due to a control dependency is shown in Figure 1b. This case is much more common than a direct data dependency and is the focus of this paper.   Algorithm 1 Control-flow hoisting of AGU requests   1: Input: 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 list of blocks that are the source of a   LoD control dependency (defined in §4)   2: Output: 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 { basic block: list of hoisted re-   quests to this block }   3: 4: for 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 do 5: 6:   ⊲ traverse the DAG from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch   for 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 (𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵) do   if 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 contains memory requests then   hoist 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 requests to the end of 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 add requests to 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 [𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵]   5 Compiler Support for Speculation We now describe our dual transformations that enable spec- ulation in the AGU and poison mis-speculations in the CU.   Algorithm 1 describes our approach to introducing specu- lation in the AGU. Given a LoD control dependency source block 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 we hoist all memory requests that are control de- pendent on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the end of 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. There can be multiple blocks with memory requests that have a LoD control depen- dency on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵, which poses the question in which order should they be hoisted to 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. We use reverse post-order in Algorithm 1.   Assuming reducible control flow, the CFG region from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch is a DAG. The reverse post-order of a DAG is its topological order. Topological ordering gives us the useful property that given two distinct basic blocks 𝐴 and 𝐵 in a given loop, if 𝐴 ≺ 𝐵 in any path through the loop then 𝐴 ≺ 𝐵 in the topological ordering. Note that there can be multiple topological orderings for a DAG, but it does not matter which one is chosen in our algorithm.   Algorithm 1 traverses the CFG region from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the end of its loop (or to the end of the function if 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 is not in a loop). During the traversal, we ignore CFG edges leading to loop headers—we do not enter loops other than the innermost loop containing 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵.   5.1.1 Example of Hoisting. Consider the CFG from Fig- ure 4a. There are three LoD control dependency source blocks (2, 3, 5) and five blocks with memory requests (blocks 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 with requests 𝑎, 𝑐, 𝑏, 𝑑, 𝑒, respectively). Assume that each block holds a single memory request—multiple memory requests within the same block are treated in the same way by our algorithms. Figure 4c shows the topological order of the loop (block 1 is omitted for brevity). Algorithm 1 will hoist 𝑏, 𝑒 to the end of block 2, and 𝑐, 𝑑, 𝑒 to the end of block 3—the result is presented in Figure 4b. Note that the requests 𝑏 and 𝑒 were hoisted to both block 2 and 3, because they are reachable from both blocks. Nothing is hoisted to block 1 since it is not a LoD control dependency source.   Figure 4. An example of introducing speculative memory requests in the AGU (§5.1); and poisoned stores in the CU (§5.2). Block 6 in subfigure (d) kills stores c, b, then uses the allocation for store d, and then kills store e.   5.1.2 Nested LoD Control Dependencies. Block 5 in Figure 4b does not contain any speculative requests because it itself has a LoD control dependency on block 2 and 3. Algorithm 1 considers only LoD control dependency source blocks that are not themselves the destination of another LoD control dependency. Given a chain of nested LoD control dependencies, we only consider the chain head. For example, the Figure 4a CFG has two LoD control dependency chains: 2, 5 and 3, 5—Algorithm 1 considers only blocks 2 and 3.   Algorithm 2 Mapping Poison Stores to CFG Edges in CU 1: Input: 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 { basic block: list of requests hoisted   to this block in Algorithm 1 }   for 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ ∈ 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑇𝑜𝐿𝑜𝑜𝑝𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵) do   2: 3: for 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵, 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 ∈ 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 do 4: 5: 6: 7: 8:   𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ← block where 𝑟 is true 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠.𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 (𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵)   𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 ← ∅ for 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 do   ⊲ set keeps insertion order   5.1.3 Why Topological Order in Algorithm 1? Topo- logical order is needed to make it possible to match the order of speculative requests made in the AGU with the order of values that will arrive from the CU on all its possible CFG paths. Consider, for example, the requests 𝑏 and 𝑐 in Fig- ure 4a. We first want to hoist 𝑐 to block 3 before hoisting 𝑏, because there exists a CFG path where 𝑐 comes before 𝑏, but not vice versa. If 𝑏 were hoisted before 𝑐, then the speculative requests order would be 𝑏 ≺ 𝑐, which would be impossible to match with values in the CU on the CFG path 3, 5, 7.   for 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ∈ 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ do   for 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 do if 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 then   ⊲ to the next edge if 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 not reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 then ⊲ reachability ignores loop backedges poison 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 requests on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ⊲ Alg. 3 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠.𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒 (𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵)   Our strategy for poisoning misspeculations in the CU is to first map a poison call to a CFG edge, and then to map that edge to a poison store call contained in an existing or newly created basic block.   Algorithm 2 describes the first step. Given block 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 that contains speculative memory requests 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠, we consider each path in the DAG from the 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch (or function exit) in the CU. We call the block where a 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 becomes true the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 (for example, the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 for request 𝑏 in Figure 4a is block 5). For each CFG path, we use the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 list to keep track of which   requests were already used or poisoned on the path—the list contains the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 for each 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠.   Given an edge in the traversal, the edge is skipped if the next 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 is still reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . This guarantees that the order of speculative requests in the AGU matches the order of values in the CU, i.e., a speculative request for a given 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 block is not poisoned immedi- ately when 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 becomes unreachable if there is an earlier speculative request that can still be used.   5.2.1 Example of Mapping Poison Stores to CFG Edges. Figure 4c shows which CFG edges are poisoned given the original CFG in Figure 4a and the AGU CFG in Figure 4b. For   Algorithm 3 Poisoning Stores on Edges in CU   1: Input: store request 𝑟 ; CFG 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒; block 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 where 𝑟   was speculated; block 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 where 𝑟 is true   ⊲ preserve set across calls   get from 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒 if exists   2: 3: 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒 ← ∅ 4: if 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 is reachable from 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 then 5: 6: 7:   𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 ← create new block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 or   append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the end of 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒.𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 (𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵) 8: 9: else if 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 does not dominate 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 then 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 ← create new block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 10: append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the end of 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 11: 12: 13:   create 𝜙 (1, 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵) value in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 branch from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 on 𝜙 = 1   ⊲ create recursively on 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 → 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 paths   append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the start of 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡   example, the path 3 → 5 → 𝐿 will have: 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) on the 3 → 5 edge; and 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑑), 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑒) on the 5 → 𝐿 edge (4th path from block 3 in Figure 4c).   5.2.2 Mapping Poisoned Edges to Basic Blocks. Algo- rithm 3 shows how poisoned CFG edges are mapped to actual poison calls placed in a concrete basic block. Given a poi- soned request 𝑟 on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 (from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 block to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 block), the 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 block where 𝑟 was speculated in the AGU, and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 where r becomes true there are three cases:   1. There exists a path from 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . In this case, we cannot insert 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , because we would end up with a CFG path where the store is both true and poisoned. To avoid this, we create a new 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to it. 2. There exists a path from the loop header to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 that does not contain 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵. In this case, we cannot insert 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , because we would end up with a CFG path where 𝑟 was not speculated in the AGU, but was poisoned in the CU. To avoid this, we create a new block 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 on the edge and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to it. We also add steering instructions to the path from 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 that will branch from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 only if 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 was encountered on the current CFG path.   3. Otherwise, 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) can safely be prepended to the   start of 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 .   Algorithm 3 is executed only once per (𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒, 𝑟 ) tuple—a given request is poisoned at most once on a given edge. Also, poison blocks created in case 1 in Algorithm 3 can be reused to poison other requests.   Figure 5. Basic blocks with the same list of poison stores and the same immediate successor can be merged in the CU.   5.2.3 Example of Mapping Poison Edges to Blocks. Consider how the poisoned edges in Figure 4c are mapped to basic blocks in Figure 4d.   Case 1: Store 𝑐 is poisoned on the 3 → 5 edge. Since there is a path from the true block of 𝑐 (block 4) to the edge destination block (block 5), we create a new block on the 3 → 5 edge and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) to it.   Case 2: Store 𝑑 is poisoned on both the 5 → 7 and 5 → 𝐿 edges. The 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 for 𝑑 is block 3. Since there exists the path 𝐻 → 1 → 2 → 5 that does not contain block 3, we create a new block on the 5 → 7 edge with the 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑑) call. We add steering instructions to the 3 → 5 and 3 → 4 → 5 paths that will cause block 5 to branch to the new poison block on the 5 → 7 edge only if block 5 was reached from a path containing block 3.   Case 3: Store 𝑐 is also poisoned on the 3 → 6 edge, but   here it is safe to prepend 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) to the start of block 6.   Case 1 and 2 of Algorithm 3 might create multiple poison blocks for the same store on different CFG edges. It is possible to merge two poison blocks into one if they contain the same list of poison stores and if they have the same list of immediate successors. When merging, we keep instructions from just one block. We apply such merging iteratively after Algorithms 2 and 3. For example, Figure 5 contains a CFG sub- region of our running example from Figure 4. Algorithm 3 inserted poison blocks 10, 11, 12, 13 to poison stores 𝑑 and 𝑒. Block pairs (11, 13) and (10, 12) can be merged.   Speculative loads are relatively easy to support. To match the order of load_consume calls in the CU with the order of speculative send_load_addr calls in the AGU we can hoist the load_consume calls to the same block where the corresponding send_load_addr were hoisted in the AGU. Then, the CU can either use the load value or discard it. After hoisting, we need to update all 𝜙 instructions that use the load value, since the basic block containing the loaded value will have changed. Alternatively, we can transform 𝜙 instructions using the load value into select instructions.   6 Safety and Liveness We prove that our transformations preserve the sequential consistency of the original program and that they do not introduce deadlock. Deadlock freedom is a corollary of se- quential consistency, so we focus only on the latter. We show that on every CFG path the order of speculative store requests in the AGU matches the order of store values in the CU, and that the non-poisoned store value sequence in the CU matches the store sequence of the original code.   In the following discussion, we assume blocks with a sin- gle store; the proof trivially extends to blocks with multi- ple stores since all speculative stores in the same block are treated the same. We also assume that all stores are specula- tive, since the relative order between non-speculative and speculative stores is guaranteed by definition: given a a non- speculative store 𝑠1 and a speculative store 𝑠2, Algorithm 1 will not change the relative program order of 𝑠1 and 𝑠2, i.e., if 𝑠1 ≺ 𝑠2 in the original program order, then it is not possible to hoist 𝑠2 such that 𝑠2 ≺ 𝑠1. This follows from the con- trol dependency definition (§4)—𝑠2 hoisting stops at its LoD control dependency source 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵, which must come after the block containing 𝑠1 in topological order. If 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 would come after 𝑠1 in topological order, then the block containing 𝑠1 would also have a LoD control dependency on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 and would have been hoisted, which is a contradiction since we assumed that 𝑠1 was non-speculative. A similar argument can be made if 𝑠2 ≺ 𝑠1 in the original program.   Lemma 6.1 (Sequential Consistency). Given an ordered list of 𝑛 speculative store requests 𝐿𝑎 = {𝑎0, 𝑎1, ..., 𝑎𝑛−1} made in the AGU loop CFG on some fixed iteration 𝑘, Algorithms 2 and 3 transform the CU CFG such that every possible path through its loop CFG on iteration 𝑘 produces an or- dered list of 𝑛 tagged store values 𝐿𝑣 = {(𝑣0, 𝑝0), (𝑣1, 𝑝1), ..., (𝑣𝑛−1, 𝑝𝑛−1)}, such that each (𝑎𝑖, 𝑣𝑖, 𝑝𝑖 ), 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛 triple cor- responds to a 𝐴[𝑎𝑖 ] ← 𝑣𝑖 store in the original program CFG, and 𝑝𝑖 = 1 (poison bit) if that store is not executed on the path through the original loop CFG on iteration 𝑘.   Proof. We use a proof by induction on the transformed CFG. Base case: 𝐿𝑎 = ∅ (no speculated requests in the AGU). Algorithm 2 does not change the CU CFG. Thus, the order of store addresses in the AGU and store values in the CU trivially matches, 𝐿𝑎 = 𝐿𝑣 = ∅.   Inductive hypothesis: assume Lemma 6.1 holds at basic block 𝐵𝑖 in the current CFG path. All store requests 𝑎 𝑗 ∈ 𝐿𝑎 contained in blocks reached before 𝐵𝑖 in the path were matched with the correct store value call (𝑣 𝑗, 𝑝 𝑗 ) ∈ 𝐿𝑣, such that 𝑝 𝑗 = 1 if 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗 ] ← 𝑣 𝑗 was not executed on the path in the original loop CFG.   Inductive step: The next store address in the AGU 𝐿𝑎 se- quence is 𝑎 𝑗+1 ∈ 𝐿𝑎. The next store value in the CU CFG path should be (𝑣 𝑗+1, 𝑝 𝑗+1) ∈ 𝐿𝑣, where 𝑝 𝑗+1 = 1 iff the store 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗+1] ← 𝑣 𝑗+1 is not reached on the current CFG   path in the original program. Algorithm 2 considers the 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 → 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 next. There are three cases:   1. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵, where 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is the block contain- ing the store 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗+1] ← 𝑣 𝑗+1 in the original program CFG. In this case, Algorithm 2 will not poison this store on this path through the CU CFG, i.e., the next item in the 𝐿𝑣 sequence will be the correct (𝑣 𝑗, 0). 2. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 ≠ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is not reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , in which case Algorithm 2 will insert a poison store on this edge. Algorithm 3 will map this poison store to a basic block, with the effect that taking the 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 will result in the poison call being executed and control transferring to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . The next item in the 𝐿𝑣 sequence will be the correct (𝑣 𝑗, 1).   3. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 ≠ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is reachable from 𝐵𝑙 , in which case Algorithm 2 will traverse the path until Case 1 or 2 is matched.   Since Lemma 6.1 holds for the base case, for basic blocks on the path up to 𝐵𝑖 , and for some successor block of 𝐵𝑖 , it must hold at any block on the path. If it holds at any block on the path, it holds for the whole path. Since a given store request 𝑟 is poisoned at most once on a given CFG edge and since, by definition of Algorithm 2, any given path will contain at most one edge where 𝑟 is poisoned, we conclude □ that Lemma 6.1 holds for all paths.   7 Applications In this section, we highlight three applications for our work: DAE-based prefetchers in CPUs/GPUs, CGRAs, and special- ized accelerators generated from HLS. In the next section, we choose HLS as an evaluation vehicle due to its simplicity compared to CPU/GPU prefetchers where the evaluation results can easily be polluted by other architectural factors like cache behavior, branch prediction, etc. However, we em- phasize that our speculation support in DAE does not rely on any HLS-specific features and can be applied wherever speculation is combined with the DAE technique.   Most existing works on CPU/GPU prefetchers follow the DAE principle and rely on the compiler to decoupled address generation from compute [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47]. All of these works suffer from the control-dependency loss of decoupling (LoD) problem (§4). The work in [24] discusses adding spec- ulation and predicated stores to the CPU microarchitecture to mitigate LoD, but their compiler only supports simple diamond and triangle control flow shapes. In this paper, we have demonstrated generalized compiler support for specu- lation in DAE, making these works viable for general control flow and thus applicable to a broader set of codes.   7.1.1 Example. The CPU prefetcher proposed in [24] (on which most of the other work is based) separates address gen- eration from compute and extends the ISA with store_addr,   load_produce, store_val, load_consume, and store_inv instructions that can be directly targeted by our compiler.   A CGRA consists of an array of PEs, each with small memo- ries, connected by a network. A CGRA compiler is typically co-designed with the hardware, as the PEs are typically stat- ically scheduled. The job of the compiler is to map the Con- trol/Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to the PEs, and many works follow the DAE technique to tackle the memory wall prob- lem [20, 27, 37, 39, 43, 45, 46, 61]. Our work can help mitigate LoD events when mapping to CGRAs.   7.2.1 Example. The CGRA proposed in [39] is an example of a modern streaming dataflow CGRA. All communication in the CGRA is FIFO-based, and address generation is ex- plicitly decoupled at compile time into AGUs. The compiler generates commands to produce address streams, and to consume or produce values. Control flow is handled with predication and there is a SD_Clean_Port command to throw away a value from an output port that can be used to imple- ment predicated stores.   In HLS, the CDFG of an algorithm is implemented directly in hardware following a spatial execution model with the freedom to customize the memory system. This makes de- coupling easier in HLS compared to the temporal CPU/GPU execution model. HLS-generated accelerators can directly benefit from our work today without any changes, and it is in this domain that we evaluate our implementation in the next section.   Although existing HLS compilers are successful in build- ing non-trivial accelerators for regular code (e.g., [48]), their static scheduling techniques are sub-optimal for irregular codes (for the same reason why traditional VLIW compilers were sub-optimal for irregular codes). Many research works in academia and industry have exploited DAE in HLS to improve the efficiency of HLS-generated accelerators for ir- regular codes [11–13, 15, 16, 21, 53–55]. By adding compiler speculation support, DAE in HLS can be used on a broader set of codes, which we demonstrate in the next section.   8 Evaluation In this section, we answer the following questions:   • What is the performance benefit of using a DAE ar- chitecture (enabled by our speculation approach) to accelerate codes with LoD control dependencies? • What is the cost of mis-speculation in our approach? • What is the impact on code size (accelerator area usage)   of our speculation approach?   • What is the scalability for nested control flow, which increases the number of poison stores and blocks? We make our work and evaluation publicly available [52].   Figure 6. Performance of DAE, SPEC and ORACLE normalized to STA. SPEC achieves an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup.   We generate algorithm-specific accelerators using HLS tar- geting an Intel Arria 10 FPGA. The C codes are taken directly from benchmark suites without adding any HLS-specific an- notations (excluding dynamic structures, like queues, that were replaced with HLS-specific libraries).   We use the LLVM-based Intel SYCL HLS compiler [29] and apply our standard DAE transformation (§3.2) and our proposed speculation transformation (§5) as LLVM passes. The codes use deterministic dual-ported on-chip SRAM ca- pable of 1 read and 1 write per cycle. To enable out-of-order loads, we use a load-store queue (LSQ) designed for HLS (load/store queue sizes of 4/32), which is commonly found on accelerators for irregular codes [1, 24, 31, 53].   We report cycle counts from ModelSim simulations. We do not report circuit frequency since our approach does not affect the critical path (see [52] for such details). Area usage is obtained after place and route using Quartus 19.2.   8.1.1 Baselines. For each benchmark, we synthesize the following architectures which represent current state-of-the- art approaches to HLS :   • STA: the default, industry-grade approach using static scheduling [29]. Loads that cannot be disambiguated at compile time execute in order.   • DAE: a DAE architecture without speculation. OoO loads are enabled by an LSQ. This is the state-of-the- art approach to irregular codes in academia [53], but it suffers from control-dependency LoDs.   • SPEC: the same as DAE, but with our speculation tech- nique which mitigates control-dependency LoDs. • ORACLE: the same as DAE, but all LoD control depen- dencies are removed manually from the input code. The ORACLE results are wrong, but give a bound on the performance of SPEC and show its area overhead.   8.1.2 Benchmarks. DAE architectures optimize the la- tency between memory and compute and are most beneficial for memory-bound codes [24], especially codes with an irreg- ular memory access pattern that prevents static prefetching [18]. We evaluate nine such benchmarks from the graph and data analytics domain, using the GAP graph benchmark   Table 1. Absolute performance and area usage of STA [29], DAE [53], SPEC, and ORACLE accelerators. (*bc uses two LSQs).   bfs bc sssp hist thr mm fw sort spmv   suite [8] and an HLS benchmark suite [14] of irregular pro- grams. We select only codes that can benefit from our SPEC approach, i.e., codes with LoD control dependencies:   • bfs: breadth-first traversal through a graph. • bc: betweenness centrality of a single node in a graph. • sssp: single shortest path from a single node to all other nodes in a graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm.   • hist: histogram, similar to Figure 1b (size 1000). • thr: zeroes RGB pixels above threshold (size 1000). • mm: maximal matching in a bipartite graph (2000 edges). • fw: Floyd-Warshall distance calculation of all node-to- node pairs in a dense graph (10×10 distance matrix).   • sort: using bitonic mergesort (size 64). • spvm: sparse vector matrix multiply (20×20 matrix).   For the graph codes (bfs, bc, sssp) we use a real-world graph email-Eu-core with 1005 nodes and 25,571 edges.   Figure 6 reports normalized speedups of each technique over STA. Our SPEC approach gives on average a 1.9× (and up to 3×) speedup over STA. This is within 5% of the ORACLE performance. In contrast, DAE without speculation sees a dramatic performance degradation over STA, because the AGU, DU, CU communication is sequentialized.   8.2.1 Mis-speculation Cost. The SPEC and ORACLE per- formance gap is highest on the bfs and bc codes, because of its deep pipeline between the load and store that form a RAW hazard. The deep pipeline means that more store allocations need to be held by the LSQ to guarantee perfect pipelining [34]. This, together with a high mis-speculation rate in these benchmarks (Table 1), can cause the LSQ to fill with store addresses that are mis-speculated, potentially stalling later loads that have to wait for future store addresses to arrive. This problem can be solved by increasing the store queue size in the LSQ. The increased number of requests and the need for more buffering is one of the limitations of our approach.   Codes with a shallower pipeline that do not need large LSQ sizes have no mis-speculation penalty.   To prove this, we choose three benchmarks where we can instrument the input data so that we can vary the mis- speculation rate. Table 2 shows how the mis-speculation cost changes as the mis-speculation rate increases. As can be seen, there is no correlation between the mis-speculation rate and cost, with the slight variability in clock cycle counts attributable to the subtle difference in the number of true RAW hazards due to the varying data distribution.   Table 2. SPEC cycle counts as mis-speculation rate changes.   hist thr mm   Mis-speculation rate   Our speculation approach can increase the number of blocks in the CU, especially for codes with deeply nested control flow. In HLS, an increased number of blocks can result in a higher area usage due to larger scheduler complexity [50]. Table 1 shows the absolute area usage of all accelerators. We observe virtually no area overhead of SPEC over ORACLE on the evaluated benchmarks. This is because most of the codes have at most two control-flow nesting levels where new poison blocks are inserted, and sometimes it is possible to reduce the number of blocks using our merging technique (e.g., two poison blocks in mm merged into one).   8.3.1 Impact of Nested Control Flow on Area Usage. To give a more meaningful measure of how nested control flow impacts the area overhead of our SPEC approach, we create a synthetic benchmark template where we can tune the number of poison blocks generated by SPEC:   for HLS with speculation support [23]. The speculation sup- port in this and other works requires costly recovery on mis-speculation [6, 22, 30, 35, 56, 60]. Efficiently squashing speculative computation on the wrong paths in a spatial dataflow architecture is hard, because the architectural state is distributed [10]. Our speculative DAE sidesteps this issue, not requiring any recovery: we speculate early (run ahead) in the AGU, and later handle mis-speculations in the CU by taking an appropriate path in its CFG.   Control-flow handling in GPUs is usually implemented via predication. The algorithms used to calculate predicate masks and re-convergence points resemble our work [32]. The SIMT stack approach in GPUs pushes predicate masks onto a stack when entering a control-flow nesting level, and pops when exiting. Our Algorithm 1 implementing specula- tive requests can be seen as a pass through the CFG with only push operations, where the push is onto individual stacks of control-dependency sources. Dually, our inserting of poison calls in Algorithm 1 can be seen as a pass through the CFG with only pop operations where the placement of the pops follows a certain policy just like modern SIMT compilers fol- low different policies to prevent SIMT deadlock and livelock, or to improve performance [19], instead of popping at the immediate post-dominator.   10 Conclusion We have presented general compiler support for specula- tive memory operations in DAE architectures that tackles the LoD problem resulting from control dependencies. We have proposed CFG transformations implementing specula- tion in the address generation slice, and poisoning of mis- speculations in the compute slice, with a proof of correctness. We have presented three applications where our work im- proves support for the efficient execution of irregular codes: DAE-based CPU/GPU prefetchers that require compiler sup- port, CGRA architectures, and HLS-generated specialized accelerators. We have evaluated our work on HLS-generated accelerators, showing an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup over non-DAE accelerators on a set of irregular benchmarks where DAE is not possible without our speculation. Our ap- proach has no mis-speculation cost and a small code size footprint, scaling well to deeply nested control flow.   Future work could investigate vector-parallelism support by filling a vector of speculative requests in the AGU and producing a store mask in the CU, similar to the recent work on decoupled vector runahead prefetching in CPUs [36].

Change in area and performance overhead of SPEC over ORACLE as the number of poison blocks and calls grows.   if 𝑥 > 0 then 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒1 if 𝑥 > 1 then 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒2 if 𝑥 > 2 then ...   poison calls.   Each nesting level in this template will result in one poison block in the SPEC architecture. With 𝑛 stores, and assuming one store per nesting level, there will be 𝑛 poison blocks and 𝑛   𝑖=1 Figure 7 shows how the area and performance overhead of SPEC over ORACLE changes as more poison blocks are needed. The performance overhead is close to 0% and does not change with more poison blocks. The area overhead of the AGU unit is similarly close to 0%, because SPEC hoists stores out of the if -conditions, causing the blocks to be deleted. The area overhead of the CU unit grows by a few percent (< 5%) with each added poison block, but even for the pathological case of eight nested if -conditions the overhead is below 25%. In real codes, with more compute and lower control-flow nesting, the area overhead of SPEC should be minimal.   9 Related Work Program slicing is used beyond DAE architectures. Decoupled Software Pipelining (DSWP) [41] is a popular transforma- tion that decouples strongly connected components in the program dependence graph into separate pipeline stages mapped over multiple PEs communicating via FIFOs. The PEs can be CPU threads, or pipeline stages in an accelerator generated by HLS [33]. Control dependent pipeline stages in DSWP can also be executed speculatively, although stages with memory operations require versioned memory [58].   Control speculation has its roots in compilers for VLIW ma- chines. Instruction scheduling in HLS is very similar to VLIW scheduling (no hardware support for speculation, static map- ping to functional units, etc.), with many algorithms like modulo-scheduling and if -conversion originally developed for VLIW directly applicable to HLS [2, 42, 50]. Most recently, predicated execution in the form of gated SSA was proposed",

         "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins which closely interact with their plasma membrane lipid microenvironment. Cholesterol is a lipid enriched at the plasma membrane with pivotal roles in the control of membrane fluidity and maintenance of membrane microarchitecture, directly impacting on GPCR stability, dynamics and function. Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation in vivo, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active versus inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these residues, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R interactions with cholesterol, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in pancreatic beta cells and primary islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor. This study 1) highlights the role of cholesterol in regulating GLP-1R responses in vivo; 2) provides a detailed map of GLP-1R - cholesterol binding sites in model membranes; 3) validates their functional relevance in beta cells; and 4) highlights their potential as locations for the rational design of novel allosteric modulators with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R responses.",

These applications involve welding, sanding,\npolishing, painting, and additive manufacturing. For redundant\nmanipulators or applications with tolerances, there exist in-\nfinitely many possible motions to track a reference end-effector\ntrajectory. Thus, planning algorithms seek to find optimal\nmotions among these possibilities based on criteria such as\nminimal joint movement [1], minimal end-effector error [1],\n[2], minimal maximum joint velocity [3], or minimal number\nof reconfigurations, i.e., instances where the robot pauses task\nexecution and restarts from another joint configuration [4], [5].\nTo track an end-effector trajectory based on some optimality\ncriteria, common graph-based approaches [1], [3], [4], [6],\n[7] first sample inverse kinematics (IK) solutions for each\nwaypoint on the reference trajectory. These IK solutions serve\nas vertices to construct a layered graph, where each layer\ncorresponds to a waypoint. Edges are added to link IK solu-\ntions in adjacent layers, and these edges’ weights are defined\naccording to the optimality criteria. Finally, a graph search\nmethod is utilized to find the optimal motion. The success of\nthis approach relies heavily on the density of the sampling\nto sufficiently discretize the solution space. Existing graph-\nbased trajectory tracking approaches often rely on uniformly\ndense IK sampling, which leads to long delays in finding initial\nsolutions. In practical scenarios with limited computational\nresources, anytime algorithms are preferred because they can\ngenerate feasible solutions quickly and progressively refine\nthem over time. This flexibility allows anytime algorithms to\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThis work was supported in part by National Science Foundation under\nAward 2007436 and in part by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the\nDepartment of Energy.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nBoth authors are with the Department of Computer Sciences, Univer-\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nsity of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA\n[yeping|gleicher]@cs.wisc.edu\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nbe stopped at any time, enabling trade-offs between solution\nquality and computation time.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn this work, we present an anytime algorithmic framework\nthat enhances existing approaches to efficiently and effec-\ntively generate robot motions to track reference end-effector\ntrajectories.

Our results\nshow that our framework accelerates both algorithms, gener-\nating solutions with less computation time than the conven-\ntional and naïve frameworks, while matching or exceeding\ntheir solution quality. Additionally, we applied it to semi-\nconstrained trajectory tracking, which expands the solution\nspace by allowing tolerances and requiring more IK samplings.\nUnlike baseline frameworks, which are inefficient due to naïve\nsampling, our framework enhances IKLink’s efficiency and\neffectiveness for this task.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nA.

Specifically, trajectory\ntracking methods [1], [2], [4], [5], [6] take a timestamped\ntrajectory as input, whereas path tracking methods [3], [7]\ntrack a sequence of coordinates without timing.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n1Open-sourced code https://github.com/uwgraphics/IKLink/tree/anytime\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nEnd-effector trajectory tracking methods can be broadly\ncategorized into two groups: trajectory optimization and graph-\nbased approaches. Trajectory optimization directly optimizes\na joint-space trajectory while satisfying constraints. For exam-\nple, Holladay et al. [9] utilize TrajOpt [10], a trajectory opti-\nmization method, to minimize the Fréchet distances between\ncurrent solutions and a given reference trajectory. Instead of\nFréchet distances, Torm [11] minimizes the summed Euclidean\ndistance between corresponding waypoints on the current and\nreference trajectories. These optimization methods require an\ninitial trajectory as a starting point, are sensitive to this initial\ntrajectory [12], and are prone to be stuck in local minima\n[9]. Meanwhile, graph-based approaches [1], [3], [4], [6], [7]\nconstruct a hierarchical graph where vertices represent inverse\nkinematics (IK) solutions. A path within the graph defines a\nrobot motion by sequentially connecting the IK solutions. We\nwill review these approaches in §III-B as part of the discussion\non the conventional algorithmic framework. Below, we discuss\nIK sampling strategies in graph-based approaches.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nB. IK Sampling in Graph-based Trajectory Tracking\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn graph-based end-effector trajectory tracking, the majority\nof the computation time is consumed by sampling inverse kine-\nmatics (IK) solutions and establishing connections between\nthem [13]. Some prior work [1], [4], [6], [7] exhaustively\nsamples IK solutions before searching for a path, resulting\nin long computation time before obtaining initial solutions.\n[2], [13]. Meanwhile, other approaches use incremental sam-\npling to accelerate the procedure. For example, CppFlow\n[3] leverages a generative IK solver, IKFlow [14], which\nrapidly produces a diverse set of IK solutions by learning the\ndistribution of uniformly sampled IK solutions. If the graph\nsearch algorithm fails to find a viable motion, the algorithm\nincrementally samples additional IK solutions to density the\ngraph. In contrast to uniform sampling, Malhan et al. [13] use\ncontinuity in Cartesian space as a heuristic for IK selection\nduring incremental graph construction. However, the heuristic\nis applicable solely to non-redundant robotic arms. Holladay\net al. [2] presents strategies to balance uniform sampling\nwith targeted sampling around certain areas. However, their\napproach is designed specifically to minimize the Fréchet dis-\ntance in Cartesian space, and it remains unclear how to adapt\ntheir strategies to address objectives such as minimizing joint\nmovements. Our method, like Holladay et al. [2], balances\nuniform and targeted sampling, but differs by sampling around\na guide path that roughly tracks the reference trajectory.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn certain trajectory tracking scenarios, precise end-effector\nmovements in all six degrees of freedom are not necessary,\ni.e., allowing for certain tolerances in Cartesian space. For\ninstance, in a drawing task, the robot may be permitted to\ntilt or rotate the pen as long as the pen tip position remains\nprecise and the motion remains collision-free. This problem is\ncalled semi-constrained end-effector trajectory tracking. Due\nto tolerances, the solution space expands, requiring more IK\nsolutions to cover the solution space. Graph-based approaches\nwith uniform sampling, e.g., Descartes [6], have a significant\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nincrease in computational load when using redundant robots\nor having tolerances on multiple degrees of freedom [15].\nTherefore, developing a more efficient algorithm is essential\nfor semi-constrained end-effector tracking. In this work, we\npresent a guided anytime algorithmic framework to accelerate\ngraph-based trajectory tracking approaches. We show how this\nframework can efficiently and effectively compute motions to\ntrack semi-constrained end-effector trajectory in §V.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIII. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW\nIn this section, we first formalize our problem statement\nand describe the conventional algorithmic framework. We then\ndescribe a naïve anytime framework and why it is ineffective.\nFinally, we give an overview of our guided anytime framework\nand its advantages over previous approaches.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nA. Problem Statement\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nConsider a k degree of freedom robot manipulator whose\njoint configuration and end-effector pose are denoted by q∈Rk\nand p∈SE(3), respectively. End-effector trajectory tracking\nrefers to the problem of computing a joint space trajectory\nξ:[0, Tχ]→Rk that drives the robot’s end-effector along a\ndesired trajectory χ:[0, Tχ]→SE(3), where Tχ represents the\ntotal time duration of the end-effector trajectory. In practice,\nthe target end-effector trajectory χ is often represented in a\ndiscrete form {(t1, p1), ..., (tn, pn)}, where pi\nis the end-\neffector pose at timestamp ti. We assume that the waypoints\nare sufficiently dense to accurately approximate χ.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nin a short\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\ntime interval τ >0, all\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn general, there are some requirements for joint space\ncontinuity, e.g.,\njoint\nmovements are within their velocity limits, vmin≤[ξ(t+τ )j\n−ξ(t)j]/τ ≤vmax, ∀j∈{1, ..., k}, ∀t∈[0, Tχ−τ ]. However,\nin\ntrajectory is complex and can\nscenarios where the input\nnot be tracked as a single, continuous path, exceptions to\nthis requirement may be permissible if the task allows for\ninterruptions. In such instances, joint discontinuities may be\nintroduced deliberately. Each joint discontinuity requires the\nrobot to perform an arm reconfiguration, in which the robot\npauses the task execution, relocates itself in the joint space,\nand resumes task execution from another configuration.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThis work focuses on the cases where the robot manipulator\nhas some redundancy; it is either a redundant arm (k > 6) or\na non-redundant arm performing semi-constrained trajectory\ntracking, where certain tolerances are permitted on the end-\nthe trajectory can\neffector poses. Due to the redundancy,\nbe tracked by infinitely many possible motions, requiring\noptimization criteria to select the best solution.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nGraph-based trajectory tracking algorithms maintain a lay-\nered graph G=(V, E), where each layer corresponds to a\nwaypoint on the reference trajectory. V and E denote vertices\nand edges in the graph, respectively. The notation V [x] denotes\nall vertices in the layer corresponding to the x-th waypoint.\nV [x][y] represents the y-th IK solution that aligns the end-\neffector with the x-th waypoint.\n|V [x]| denotes the total\nnumber of vertices in V [x].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nB. Baseline 1: Conventional Algorithmic Framework\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nMany existing graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms\nuse a sequential framework. As shown in Figure 1-A, these\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nconstruct the robot motion. Hence, we seek ways to improve\nthe sampling process, i.e., biasing sampling towards areas with\na high probability of being selected. Additionally, the number\nof IK solutions decides the number of edges in the graph; a\nsmall set of IK solutions can reduce the time for connectivity\nchecking and graph search.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nC. Baseline 2: Naïve Anytime Algorithmic Framework\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe aforementioned conventional framework does not pro-\nvide a solution until completion. In contrast, an anytime algo-\nrithm provides an initial solution and then iteratively refines\nit, enabling the process to be stopped at any time and allowing\nfor tradeoffs between solution quality and computation time.\nAs shown in Figure 1-B, a naïve anytime framework uses the\nsame random sampling process to initially sample a smaller\nset of IK solutions, from which a layered graph is constructed.\nA graph search is then conducted to identify an initial solution.\nThe solution is iteratively refined by sampling additional IK\nsolutions, expanding the graph, and performing further graph\nsearches to find new solutions. The solutions are always at\nleast as good as, if not better than, the previous ones because\nthe graph incorporates all vertices and edges from its previous\nversion. The algorithm continues until it reaches a predefined\nthreshold, such as running time or the number of iterations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAnalysis: The naïve anytime framework has the advantage\nof generating an initial solution quickly and refining it over\ntime. However, it requires some heuristic to find an effective\ninitial solution. In our implementation, we use an optimization-\nbased IK solver to find IK solutions that are close to those of\nthe previous waypoints, which helps ensure smooth motion.\nThis heuristic is similar to GreedyIK in Wang et al. [4].\nDespite this, the naïve framework often converges slowly,\nbecause the samples are added in a random order. This\neffect is demonstrated in the experiments in §V. Meanwhile,\nour proposed algorithmic framework uses heuristics to bias\nsampling such that initial solutions are likely to be effective,\nand the additional sampling focuses on adding samples likely\nto improve the solution.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nD. Overview of Guided Anytime Algorithmic Framework\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nSimilar to the aforementioned approaches,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthe proposed\nframework maintains a layered graph, in which a layer corre-\nsponds to a waypoint on the reference trajectory and a vertex\nrepresents an IK solution. The key idea of our method is to\nbias sampling toward guide paths. A guide path is a sequence\nof vertices that approximately tracks the reference trajectory. It\ntypically includes sparse edges that connect vertices that are\na few layers apart. Upon refinement, guide paths are likely\nto be good solutions. A solution is a path through the graph\nwith a vertex at every time step, thus accurately tracking the\ntrajectory. During refinement, sparse edges within guide paths\nare potentially replaced by dense edges which connect vertices\nwith adjacent timestamps, thereby gradually converting guide\npaths to solutions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs shown in Figure 2, our algorithm starts by constructing a\ngraph in which IK solutions are sampled for certain waypoints\nand connected using sparse edges. An initial guide path is\nidentified by searching over these sparse edges. The guide\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 1. Three algorithmic frameworks described and evaluated in this paper\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\napproaches sample inverse kinematics (IK) solutions for each\nwaypoint on the end-effector trajectory, use these IK solutions\nas graph vertices, and search for a solution in the graph.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n1) IK Sampling: The two primary goals of IK sampling\nare to find IK solutions that are diverse enough to cover the\nentire solution space and dense enough to construct a smooth\nmotion. In order to generate diverse IK solutions, one common\napproach is to randomly sample starting configurations in a\nrobot’s joint space and find IK solutions that are closest to the\nstarting configurations using an optimization-based IK solver,\nsuch as Trac-IK [16] or RelaxedIK [17], or an iterative IK\nsolver, such as Orocos KDL or the damped least squares IK\nalgorithm [18]. Another approach [3] uses a learned generative\nIK solver, IKFlow [14], which learns the distribution of\nuniformly sampled IK solutions and efficiently generates a\ndiverse set of IK solutions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo ensure sufficient density of IK solutions, many previous\napproaches specify a fixed number of IK solutions for each\nwaypoint, represented by m. For example, Stampede [1] sets\nm=250, IKLink [4] sets m=300, and CppFlow [3] sets\nm=175. We note that these numbers are used for a 7-DoF\nrobotic arm to track a fully constrained end-effector trajectory.\nFor scenarios involving a more redundant robot (DoF>7)\nor a semi-constrained trajectory, more IK solutions may be\nnecessary. This is because the solution space is larger and\nrequires more IK solutions to densely cover the entire space.\n2) Graph Construction: The sampled IK solutions are used\nas vertices to construct a layered graph where each layer\ncorresponds to a waypoint on the end-effector trajectory. Edges\nconnect vertices in consecutive layers if the robot can move\nbetween the two IK solutions within the time budget specified\nby the reference trajectory. Edge weights are defined based on\nvarious problem formulations such as total joint movement [1]\nor maximum joint movement [3].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3) Graph Search: Once the graph is constructed, any\npaths within the graph represent possible robot motions by\nconnecting the IK solutions. The shortest path from the first\nlayer to the last layer corresponds to a high-quality motion\nthat tracks the trajectory. Different methods are utilized to\nsearch for the shortest path. For example, Descartes [6] uses\nDijkstra’s algorithm, Niyaz et al. [7] uses lifelong planning\nA∗, Stampede [1] uses value iteration, and IKLink [4] uses a\ndynamic programming method with two objectives.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAnalysis: Although multiple IK solutions are sampled for\na waypoint, ultimately, only one IK solution is selected to\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFig. 2. An illustration of the guided anytime algorithmic framework. In the 1st iteration, A a limited set of IK solutions are sampled for specific waypoints.\nB The IK solutions construct a graph with sparse edges (dashed lines) and a guide path (red) is identified by searching in the graph. C Additional IK\nsolutions are sampled with a bias toward the guide path. D Dense edges (solid lines) are added to connect vertices in adjacent layers and an initial solution\n(red) is identified by searching through the dense edges. In the 2nd iteration, E additional sparse edges are added to connect the newly added vertices, and a\nnew guide path (red) is found by searching through both sparse and dense edges. F More vertices are sampled, biasing toward the new guide path. G After\nadditional dense edges are added, a new solution (red) is identified in the new graph. In subsequent iterations, the algorithm continues to densify the graph\nand refine the solutions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\npath is refined by adding vertices near it and connecting them\nwith dense edges. An initial solution is found by searching\nover the dense edges. The process is repeated by identifying\nnew guide paths, performing further sampling around them,\nand finding new solutions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nStages: Our framework contains six stages, briefly described\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nhere. The details of the stages are outlined in §IV.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n1) Sparse Vertex Sampling: In contrast to the conventional\nframework which samples IK solutions for every waypoint,\nthis stage samples a limited number of IK solutions for a subset\nof waypoints spaced apart. We sample at every s waypoint,\nwhere the sparse step size s is a hyperparameter.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n2) Sparse Edge Addition: This stage adds sparse edges to\nthe graph, connecting vertices that are s layers apart. While\nsparse edges still correspond to feasible motion segments,\nthey typically do not accurately track the reference trajectory\nbecause intermediate waypoints are omitted.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n3) Guide Path Search: This stage identifies a guide path\nby finding the shortest path from the first to the last layer,\nusing both dense and sparse edges. Guide paths correspond\nto motions that approximately track the reference end-effector\ntrajectory. The heuristic assumes that high-quality solutions\nare likely to be found near guide paths.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n4) Additional Vertex Sampling: This stage adds vertices\nto the graph through a combination of random sampling\nand targeted sampling around a guide path. The underlying\nassumption is that IK solutions near the guide path are more\nlikely to yield high-quality solutions. In addition, we also\nrandomly sample an equivalent number of IK solutions. This\nhelps avoid local minima where guide paths are misleading\nand ensures that the algorithm converges to the same worst-\ncase expected performance as the conventional approach.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncertain sparse edges are superseded by the dense edges.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n6) Solution Search: This stage identifies a solution by\nfinding the shortest path from the first to the last layer using\nonly dense edges. The solution, containing only dense edges,\nprecisely tracks the reference trajectory.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIncremental Improvement: As shown in Algorithm 1, after\ngenerating a solution, the algorithm repeats the process, which\ninvolves identifying a new guide path, sampling additional\nvertices with a bias toward this new guide path, adding dense\nedges to connect the new vertices, and finding a new solution\nin the new graph. Because each new graph contains vertices\nand dense edges from its predecessor, each new solution is at\nleast as good as, if not better than, the solution before, thus\nensuring incremental improvement. The algorithm terminates\nupon reaching a predefined threshold, such as maximum\nrunning time or sampling capacity.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAnalysis: The proposed framework involves random sam-\npling IK solutions, which mimics the process of the baseline\napproaches. Therefore, given sufficient time, our method will\ngenerate the same (probabilistic) sample set as the baseline\napproaches. With finite time and sampling budget, even the\nbaseline approaches cannot provide guarantees of optimality,\nalthough Holladay [2] has proven that a similar algorithm con-\nverges towards optimality as the sampling density grows. Most\nprior works [1], [4], [3] empirically show the effectiveness of\ntheir algorithms. Similarly, we empirically demonstrate that\nour sampling strategy often more quickly finds solutions with\nbetter or equal quality in §V.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIV.

We use\nRelaxedIK [17] in our implementation, but any other IK\nsolvers mentioned in §III-B1 are also compatible.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn order to randomly sample IK solutions across the entire\ntrajectory, we first randomly select waypoints using Softmax,\nwhich assigns higher selection probabilities to waypoints with\nfewer randomly sampled IK solutions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nexp(−|Vr[x]|)\ni=0 exp(−|Vr[i]|)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhere x is the waypoint index, and |Vr[x]| is the number of\nexisting randomly sampled IK solutions for waypoint x.

As detailed\nin Algorithm 4, the procedure involves iterating over all pairs\nof vertices located on adjacent layers. The algorithm uses\nthe Linkable function to check the feasibility of each pair.\nAfter adding dense edges, the algorithm identifies and removes\nthe sparse edges that have been superseded by dense edges.\nSpecifically, if there exists a path composed of dense edges\nthat connects the two endpoint vertices of a sparse edge, and\nthe path’s cost is similar to the sparse edge’s cost, maintaining\nthe sparse edge becomes unnecessary. Our approach shares a\nsimilar idea with lazy planning [19], [20], which delays the\nevaluation of edges until they are necessary for the solution.\nIn our approach, sparse edges serve as estimators and a more\naccurate cost is computed when replacing sparse edges with\ndense edges.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n6) Solution Search: This stage identifies a solution by\nfinding the lowest cost path from the first to the last layer,\nusing only dense edges. Specific graph search approaches\ndescribed in §III-B3 can be used to find the shortest path.\nThe identified solution corresponds to a motion that accurately\ntracks every waypoint on the reference trajectory.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nV.

The first testbed tracks\n10 randomly generated trajectories, comparing our frame-\nwork with various parameter settings (step size s=3, 5, or 10)\nagainst the baselines.

We note that the Rust implementation per-\nforms faster than the implementation evaluated in the original\npaper [4]. Our framework used md=5, δ=0.2, η=1.1 (across\nall experiments), m0=50 (Experiments A&B) and m0=500\n(Experiment C). All evaluations were performed on a laptop\nwith an Intel i7-11800H 2.30 GHz CPU and 16 GB of RAM.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe apply our framework to the Stampede algorithm [1]\nto find robot motions that track end-effector trajectories with\nminimal joint movements. As proposed in the original pa-\nper, Stampede used the conventional sequential framework.\nStampede samples IK solutions by initiating an optimization-\nbased IK solver, RelaxedIK [17], with starting configurations\nsampled from a uniform distribution. Additionally,\nit uses\nvalue iteration for graph search. Since our objective is to\nminimize joint movements, we define the edge weights within\nthe graph as the Euclidean distances in joint space between\ntwo joint configurations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThis experiment uses a 7-degrees-of-freedom KUKA LBR\niiwa robot. The first testbed tracks 10 random cumulative\ncubic Bézier curves [22] for smooth position and orientation\nchanges. These trajectories have an average length of 1.26 m,\nan average angular displacement of 5.13 rad, and an average of\n379.4 waypoints. The second testbed replicates a writing task\nfrom prior work [3], [11], where the robot traces a “hello”\ntrajectory. The trajectory is rescaled to fit iiwa’s workspace.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs shown in the left column of Figure 3, while all three\napproaches generated motions with similar joint movements,\nour framework achieved initial solutions 2× faster. The results\nshow that our heuristic is effective for simple trajectories and\nenables fast identification of effective motions.\nB. Experiment B - Tracking with Minimal Reconfigurations\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe apply our framework to the IKLink algorithm [4]\nwhich utilizes the conventional sequential framework to track\nthe end-effector trajectory of any complexity. If a reference\ntrajectory is too complex to be tracked as a single, continuous\npath, IKLink generates motions with minimal reconfigurations.\nIn addition, IKLink has a secondary objective of minimizing\njoint movements. Similar to Stampede, IKLink uses RelaxedIK\n[17] to uniformly sample IK solutions. It also leverages\nRelaxedIK’s velocity regularization to find IK solutions close\nto those in the previous layer,\nthereby generating smooth\nmotions. Moreover, similar IK solutions are merged using\na clustering method. IKLink finds motions using dynamic\nprogramming, which incorporates both the number of recon-\nfigurations and joint movements as objectives.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThis experiment uses a 7-DoF Franka Panda robot. The\nfirst testbed tracks random trajectories that consist of two con-\nsecutive cubic cumulative Bézier curves [22]. The trajectories\naverage 2.26 m in length, 12.07 rad in angular displacement,\nand 677.6 waypoints. The second testbed involves a 3D\nscanning task, in which a robot accurately moves a sensor\nalong a predefined trajectory, ensuring the sensor consistently\npoints at the object.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs shown in Figure 3, our framework was more efficient\nand converged to motions with fewer or equal configurations,\ncompared to both the conventional framework (baseline 1) and\nthe naïve anytime framework (baseline 2).\nC.

For specific tasks (bottom row), the results are averaged over 10 repetitions of the same trajectory, with colored regions indicating the range\nbetween the maximum and minimum values within these repetitions. In the line charts, the initial point of a line encodes the average computation time to get\ninitial solutions.

This requirement becomes\noverly restrictive in applications such as welding, where\nthe torch may rotate around its principal axis. In contrast,\nsemi-constrained trajectory tracking allows the end-effector\nto move within certain tolerances. Semi-constrained tracking\nposes a greater challenge to graph-based approaches because\nthe solution space is larger and requires more samplings to\nsufficiently cover the solution space. We demonstrate that the\nIKLink using the conventional framework struggles to quickly\nfind plausible motions, and the proposed anytime framework\nenables IKLinks to efficiently and effectively track trajectory\nwith tolerances. We use RangedIK [23] as the IK solver, which\nis an extension of RelaxedIK that generates IK solutions that\nmove the end-effector within specified tolerances.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe first testbed randomly generates 10 welding trajectories\nfor a Franka Panda robot. Each trajectory is composed of\nfour cumulative cubic Bézier curves [22]. The trajectories\naverage 1.29 m in length, 22.70 rad in angular displacement,\nand 646.8 waypoints. Compared to the random trajectories\nin Experiments A and B,\nthese trajectories involve more\nrotational movements. In the welding task, the tolerance is\nalong the torch’s principal axis, i.e., the robot is allowed to\nfreely rotate its end-effector along the principal axis (z-axis).\nAs shown in Figure 3, the principal axis is angled 45 degrees\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nfrom the robot’s last axis. The robot must coordinate the\nmovement of all its joints to exploit the tolerance, in contrast to\njust rotating the last joint when the principal axis aligns with\nthe last axis. In the second testbed, a 7-degrees-of-freedom\nRethink Robotics Sawyer robot performs a sanding task by\ntracking a spiral trajectory. The robot can freely rotate the\nsanding tool around its principal axis, which is oriented 90\ndegrees from the robot’s last axis.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs shown in Figure 3, our framework enabled IKLink to\nquickly find motions with fewer reconfigurations than the\nbaseline frameworks, while IKLink with both the conventional\nand naïve anytime frameworks struggled to find optimal solu-\ntions for trajectories with tolerances.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSummary: Across all experiments, our anytime framework\nrequires less computation time to achieve motions of the same\nquality and reaches equal or better motion quality within\nthe same time frame compared to both the conventional and\nnaïve anytime frameworks. Figure 3 shows that our framework\nconsistently outperforms the baselines (our lines are consis-\ntently below or overlapping with the baselines), while Table I\npresents the corresponding quantitative results.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nExperiments A and B show that our framework accelerates\nthe performance of both Stampede and IKLink, enabling\n3Visualization tool: https://github.com/uwgraphics/MotionComparator\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthem to find motions of higher or equal quality in less time,\nin comparison to both the conventional and naïve anytime\nframeworks.

A\nsmaller s increases the number of IK samples in Stage 1,\nsparse vertex sampling, thereby raising computation time for\nobtaining initial solutions. Meanwhile, a larger s reduces the\naccuracy of guide paths as cost estimators, leading to slower\nalgorithm convergence. In our experiments, we observe a\nsweetspot at s=5.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nVI. DISCUSSION\nThis section summarizes the limitations, implications, and\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nconclusions of our work.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nLimitations: Our work has several limitations that suggest\nfuture research directions. First, our algorithm lacks a quality-\nbased stopping threshold; users can specify the maximum\nnumber of iterations, running time, or sampling budget, but\nthe algorithm does not automatically stop upon convergence.\nFuture work should explore the effects of adaptive stopping\nthresholds such as when the guide path no longer updates with\niterations. Second, our method uses a heuristic to bias sam-\npling in graph-based approaches. While we provide empirical\nevidence to demonstrate its ability to efficiently produce high-\nquality solutions, we cannot guarantee consistent performance\nacross all scenarios. In certain scenarios, the heuristic may\nbe misleading, causing the method to be slower than the\nnaive anytime framework. Future work may provide a more\nrigorous understanding of the heuristic’s effectiveness. Third,\nwhile we expect that our framework generalizes across many\ngraph-based tracking algorithms, we have only demonstrated\nit on two. Finally, the present work does not consider dynamic\nconstraints, focusing solely on the velocity constraints of robot\njoints. Future work should consider incorporating acceleration\nconstraints and the inertia of the robot to improve the quality\nof generated motions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nImplications: The guided anytime framework presented in\nthis work enables graph-based approaches to efficiently and\neffectively find motions that accurately move a manipulator’s\nend-effector along reference trajectories. It quickly generates\ninitial solutions and continues to refine them as needed. We\nhave demonstrated that it accelerates and improves solutions\nover prior methods and enables solving problems that a prior\nmethod cannot. The proposed framework is particularly bene-\nficial for scenarios where end-effector trajectories are complex\nor have specific tolerances.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nConclusion: This paper presented an anytime framework\nthat enables graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms to\nefficiently and effectively find robot motions.

         " – Preprint –   Anytime Planning for End-Effector Trajectory Tracking   Yeping Wang and Michael Gleicher   M ANY applications require a robot manipulator to accu-   rately and smoothly move its end-effector along a spe- cific trajectory. These applications involve welding, sanding, polishing, painting, and additive manufacturing. For redundant manipulators or applications with tolerances, there exist in- finitely many possible motions to track a reference end-effector trajectory. Thus, planning algorithms seek to find optimal motions among these possibilities based on criteria such as minimal joint movement [1], minimal end-effector error [1], [2], minimal maximum joint velocity [3], or minimal number of reconfigurations, i.e., instances where the robot pauses task execution and restarts from another joint configuration [4], [5]. To track an end-effector trajectory based on some optimality criteria, common graph-based approaches [1], [3], [4], [6], [7] first sample inverse kinematics (IK) solutions for each waypoint on the reference trajectory. These IK solutions serve as vertices to construct a layered graph, where each layer corresponds to a waypoint. Edges are added to link IK solu- tions in adjacent layers, and these edges’ weights are defined according to the optimality criteria. Finally, a graph search method is utilized to find the optimal motion. The success of this approach relies heavily on the density of the sampling to sufficiently discretize the solution space. Existing graph- based trajectory tracking approaches often rely on uniformly dense IK sampling, which leads to long delays in finding initial solutions. In practical scenarios with limited computational resources, anytime algorithms are preferred because they can generate feasible solutions quickly and progressively refine them over time. This flexibility allows anytime algorithms to   be stopped at any time, enabling trade-offs between solution quality and computation time.   In this work, we present an anytime algorithmic framework that enhances existing approaches to efficiently and effec- tively generate robot motions to track reference end-effector trajectories. Our framework enhances existing methods by incorporating a heuristic to prioritize samples that are likely to lead to good solutions. Our key insight is to identify guide paths that approximately track the reference trajectory and strategically bias sampling toward the guide paths, which progressively densifies the graph. This approach enables fre- quent identification of effective solutions within a significantly reduced timeframe. Over time, the graph converges towards the dense graph used in conventional algorithms. We show that, in the worst case, our anytime framework converges to the conventional framework, although in practice its ability to sample strategically usually leads to better results in less time. The algorithmic framework is independent of specific IK sampling algorithms, optimality criteria, or graph searching algorithms. We provide an open-source implementation of our framework 1.   The central contribution of this work is a guided anytime algorithmic framework (Sections III-D and IV). To explain our approach, we first describe the conventional sequential framework and a naïve anytime framework as baselines (Sec- tions III-B and III-C). We evaluated our framework through three experiments (§V). First, we applied it to two end-effector trajectory tracking algorithms, Stampede [1] and IKLink [4], originally based on the conventional framework. Our results show that our framework accelerates both algorithms, gener- ating solutions with less computation time than the conven- tional and naïve frameworks, while matching or exceeding their solution quality. Additionally, we applied it to semi- constrained trajectory tracking, which expands the solution space by allowing tolerances and requiring more IK samplings. Unlike baseline frameworks, which are inefficient due to naïve sampling, our framework enhances IKLink’s efficiency and effectiveness for this task.   The end-effector trajectory tracking problem, also known as path-wise inverse kinematics [1], task-space non-revisiting tracking [5], or task-constrained motion planning [8], involves various approaches based on input type. Specifically, trajectory tracking methods [1], [2], [4], [5], [6] take a timestamped trajectory as input, whereas path tracking methods [3], [7] track a sequence of coordinates without timing.   End-effector trajectory tracking methods can be broadly categorized into two groups: trajectory optimization and graph- based approaches. Trajectory optimization directly optimizes a joint-space trajectory while satisfying constraints. For exam- ple, Holladay et al. [9] utilize TrajOpt [10], a trajectory opti- mization method, to minimize the Fréchet distances between current solutions and a given reference trajectory. Instead of Fréchet distances, Torm [11] minimizes the summed Euclidean distance between corresponding waypoints on the current and reference trajectories. These optimization methods require an initial trajectory as a starting point, are sensitive to this initial trajectory [12], and are prone to be stuck in local minima [9]. Meanwhile, graph-based approaches [1], [3], [4], [6], [7] construct a hierarchical graph where vertices represent inverse kinematics (IK) solutions. A path within the graph defines a robot motion by sequentially connecting the IK solutions. We will review these approaches in §III-B as part of the discussion on the conventional algorithmic framework. Below, we discuss IK sampling strategies in graph-based approaches.   B. IK Sampling in Graph-based Trajectory Tracking   In graph-based end-effector trajectory tracking, the majority of the computation time is consumed by sampling inverse kine- matics (IK) solutions and establishing connections between them [13]. Some prior work [1], [4], [6], [7] exhaustively samples IK solutions before searching for a path, resulting in long computation time before obtaining initial solutions. [2], [13]. Meanwhile, other approaches use incremental sam- pling to accelerate the procedure. For example, CppFlow [3] leverages a generative IK solver, IKFlow [14], which rapidly produces a diverse set of IK solutions by learning the distribution of uniformly sampled IK solutions. If the graph search algorithm fails to find a viable motion, the algorithm incrementally samples additional IK solutions to density the graph. In contrast to uniform sampling, Malhan et al. [13] use continuity in Cartesian space as a heuristic for IK selection during incremental graph construction. However, the heuristic is applicable solely to non-redundant robotic arms. Holladay et al. [2] presents strategies to balance uniform sampling with targeted sampling around certain areas. However, their approach is designed specifically to minimize the Fréchet dis- tance in Cartesian space, and it remains unclear how to adapt their strategies to address objectives such as minimizing joint movements. Our method, like Holladay et al. [2], balances uniform and targeted sampling, but differs by sampling around a guide path that roughly tracks the reference trajectory.   In certain trajectory tracking scenarios, precise end-effector movements in all six degrees of freedom are not necessary, i.e., allowing for certain tolerances in Cartesian space. For instance, in a drawing task, the robot may be permitted to tilt or rotate the pen as long as the pen tip position remains precise and the motion remains collision-free. This problem is called semi-constrained end-effector trajectory tracking. Due to tolerances, the solution space expands, requiring more IK solutions to cover the solution space. Graph-based approaches with uniform sampling, e.g., Descartes [6], have a significant   increase in computational load when using redundant robots or having tolerances on multiple degrees of freedom [15]. Therefore, developing a more efficient algorithm is essential for semi-constrained end-effector tracking. In this work, we present a guided anytime algorithmic framework to accelerate graph-based trajectory tracking approaches. We show how this framework can efficiently and effectively compute motions to track semi-constrained end-effector trajectory in §V.   III. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW In this section, we first formalize our problem statement and describe the conventional algorithmic framework. We then describe a naïve anytime framework and why it is ineffective. Finally, we give an overview of our guided anytime framework and its advantages over previous approaches.   Consider a k degree of freedom robot manipulator whose joint configuration and end-effector pose are denoted by q∈Rk and p∈SE(3), respectively. End-effector trajectory tracking refers to the problem of computing a joint space trajectory ξ:[0, Tχ]→Rk that drives the robot’s end-effector along a desired trajectory χ:[0, Tχ]→SE(3), where Tχ represents the total time duration of the end-effector trajectory. In practice, the target end-effector trajectory χ is often represented in a discrete form {(t1, p1), ..., (tn, pn)}, where pi is the end- effector pose at timestamp ti. We assume that the waypoints are sufficiently dense to accurately approximate χ.   in a short   time interval τ >0, all   In general, there are some requirements for joint space continuity, e.g., joint movements are within their velocity limits, vmin≤[ξ(t+τ )j −ξ(t)j]/τ ≤vmax, ∀j∈{1, ..., k}, ∀t∈[0, Tχ−τ ]. However, in trajectory is complex and can scenarios where the input not be tracked as a single, continuous path, exceptions to this requirement may be permissible if the task allows for interruptions. In such instances, joint discontinuities may be introduced deliberately. Each joint discontinuity requires the robot to perform an arm reconfiguration, in which the robot pauses the task execution, relocates itself in the joint space, and resumes task execution from another configuration.   This work focuses on the cases where the robot manipulator has some redundancy; it is either a redundant arm (k > 6) or a non-redundant arm performing semi-constrained trajectory tracking, where certain tolerances are permitted on the end- the trajectory can effector poses. Due to the redundancy, be tracked by infinitely many possible motions, requiring optimization criteria to select the best solution.   Graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms maintain a lay- ered graph G=(V, E), where each layer corresponds to a waypoint on the reference trajectory. V and E denote vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The notation V [x] denotes all vertices in the layer corresponding to the x-th waypoint. V [x][y] represents the y-th IK solution that aligns the end- effector with the x-th waypoint. |V [x]| denotes the total number of vertices in V [x].   Many existing graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms use a sequential framework. As shown in Figure 1-A, these   construct the robot motion. Hence, we seek ways to improve the sampling process, i.e., biasing sampling towards areas with a high probability of being selected. Additionally, the number of IK solutions decides the number of edges in the graph; a small set of IK solutions can reduce the time for connectivity checking and graph search.   The aforementioned conventional framework does not pro- vide a solution until completion. In contrast, an anytime algo- rithm provides an initial solution and then iteratively refines it, enabling the process to be stopped at any time and allowing for tradeoffs between solution quality and computation time. As shown in Figure 1-B, a naïve anytime framework uses the same random sampling process to initially sample a smaller set of IK solutions, from which a layered graph is constructed. A graph search is then conducted to identify an initial solution. The solution is iteratively refined by sampling additional IK solutions, expanding the graph, and performing further graph searches to find new solutions. The solutions are always at least as good as, if not better than, the previous ones because the graph incorporates all vertices and edges from its previous version. The algorithm continues until it reaches a predefined threshold, such as running time or the number of iterations.   Analysis: The naïve anytime framework has the advantage of generating an initial solution quickly and refining it over time. However, it requires some heuristic to find an effective initial solution. In our implementation, we use an optimization- based IK solver to find IK solutions that are close to those of the previous waypoints, which helps ensure smooth motion. This heuristic is similar to GreedyIK in Wang et al. [4]. Despite this, the naïve framework often converges slowly, because the samples are added in a random order. This effect is demonstrated in the experiments in §V. Meanwhile, our proposed algorithmic framework uses heuristics to bias sampling such that initial solutions are likely to be effective, and the additional sampling focuses on adding samples likely to improve the solution.   D. Overview of Guided Anytime Algorithmic Framework   Similar to the aforementioned approaches,   the proposed framework maintains a layered graph, in which a layer corre- sponds to a waypoint on the reference trajectory and a vertex represents an IK solution. The key idea of our method is to bias sampling toward guide paths. A guide path is a sequence of vertices that approximately tracks the reference trajectory. It typically includes sparse edges that connect vertices that are a few layers apart. Upon refinement, guide paths are likely to be good solutions. A solution is a path through the graph with a vertex at every time step, thus accurately tracking the trajectory. During refinement, sparse edges within guide paths are potentially replaced by dense edges which connect vertices with adjacent timestamps, thereby gradually converting guide paths to solutions.   As shown in Figure 2, our algorithm starts by constructing a graph in which IK solutions are sampled for certain waypoints and connected using sparse edges. An initial guide path is identified by searching over these sparse edges. The guide   approaches sample inverse kinematics (IK) solutions for each waypoint on the end-effector trajectory, use these IK solutions as graph vertices, and search for a solution in the graph.   1) IK Sampling: The two primary goals of IK sampling are to find IK solutions that are diverse enough to cover the entire solution space and dense enough to construct a smooth motion. In order to generate diverse IK solutions, one common approach is to randomly sample starting configurations in a robot’s joint space and find IK solutions that are closest to the starting configurations using an optimization-based IK solver, such as Trac-IK [16] or RelaxedIK [17], or an iterative IK solver, such as Orocos KDL or the damped least squares IK algorithm [18]. Another approach [3] uses a learned generative IK solver, IKFlow [14], which learns the distribution of uniformly sampled IK solutions and efficiently generates a diverse set of IK solutions.   To ensure sufficient density of IK solutions, many previous approaches specify a fixed number of IK solutions for each waypoint, represented by m. For example, Stampede [1] sets m=250, IKLink [4] sets m=300, and CppFlow [3] sets m=175. We note that these numbers are used for a 7-DoF robotic arm to track a fully constrained end-effector trajectory. For scenarios involving a more redundant robot (DoF>7) or a semi-constrained trajectory, more IK solutions may be necessary. This is because the solution space is larger and requires more IK solutions to densely cover the entire space. 2) Graph Construction: The sampled IK solutions are used as vertices to construct a layered graph where each layer corresponds to a waypoint on the end-effector trajectory. Edges connect vertices in consecutive layers if the robot can move between the two IK solutions within the time budget specified by the reference trajectory. Edge weights are defined based on various problem formulations such as total joint movement [1] or maximum joint movement [3].   3) Graph Search: Once the graph is constructed, any paths within the graph represent possible robot motions by connecting the IK solutions. The shortest path from the first layer to the last layer corresponds to a high-quality motion that tracks the trajectory. Different methods are utilized to search for the shortest path. For example, Descartes [6] uses Dijkstra’s algorithm, Niyaz et al. [7] uses lifelong planning A∗, Stampede [1] uses value iteration, and IKLink [4] uses a dynamic programming method with two objectives.   Analysis: Although multiple IK solutions are sampled for a waypoint, ultimately, only one IK solution is selected to   path is refined by adding vertices near it and connecting them with dense edges. An initial solution is found by searching over the dense edges. The process is repeated by identifying new guide paths, performing further sampling around them, and finding new solutions.   Stages: Our framework contains six stages, briefly described   here. The details of the stages are outlined in §IV.   1) Sparse Vertex Sampling: In contrast to the conventional framework which samples IK solutions for every waypoint, this stage samples a limited number of IK solutions for a subset of waypoints spaced apart. We sample at every s waypoint, where the sparse step size s is a hyperparameter.   2) Sparse Edge Addition: This stage adds sparse edges to the graph, connecting vertices that are s layers apart. While sparse edges still correspond to feasible motion segments, they typically do not accurately track the reference trajectory because intermediate waypoints are omitted.   3) Guide Path Search: This stage identifies a guide path by finding the shortest path from the first to the last layer, using both dense and sparse edges. Guide paths correspond to motions that approximately track the reference end-effector trajectory. The heuristic assumes that high-quality solutions are likely to be found near guide paths.   4) Additional Vertex Sampling: This stage adds vertices to the graph through a combination of random sampling and targeted sampling around a guide path. The underlying assumption is that IK solutions near the guide path are more likely to yield high-quality solutions. In addition, we also randomly sample an equivalent number of IK solutions. This helps avoid local minima where guide paths are misleading and ensures that the algorithm converges to the same worst- case expected performance as the conventional approach.   certain sparse edges are superseded by the dense edges.   6) Solution Search: This stage identifies a solution by finding the shortest path from the first to the last layer using only dense edges. The solution, containing only dense edges, precisely tracks the reference trajectory.   Incremental Improvement: As shown in Algorithm 1, after generating a solution, the algorithm repeats the process, which involves identifying a new guide path, sampling additional vertices with a bias toward this new guide path, adding dense edges to connect the new vertices, and finding a new solution in the new graph. Because each new graph contains vertices and dense edges from its predecessor, each new solution is at least as good as, if not better than, the solution before, thus ensuring incremental improvement. The algorithm terminates upon reaching a predefined threshold, such as maximum running time or sampling capacity.   Analysis: The proposed framework involves random sam- pling IK solutions, which mimics the process of the baseline approaches. Therefore, given sufficient time, our method will generate the same (probabilistic) sample set as the baseline approaches. With finite time and sampling budget, even the baseline approaches cannot provide guarantees of optimality, although Holladay [2] has proven that a similar algorithm con- verges towards optimality as the sampling density grows. Most prior works [1], [4], [3] empirically show the effectiveness of their algorithms. Similarly, we empirically demonstrate that our sampling strategy often more quickly finds solutions with better or equal quality in §V.   IV. TECHNICAL DETAILS In §III-D, we gave an overview of our anytime algorithmic   framework; this section details its stages.   5) Dense Edge Addition: This stage adds dense edges to the graph to connect vertices in adjacent layers. In addition,   1) Sparse Vertex Sampling: This stage involves sampling m0 IK solutions for every s waypoint, starting from index   the need for a sparse edge.   1 and including index n. A total of ⌈n/s + 1⌉ × m0 IK solutions are sampled, where n is the number of waypoints on the reference trajectory and ⌈·⌉ is a ceiling function that rounds a real number up to the nearest integer. The specific sampling methods described in §III-B1 can be used to sample IK solutions. This stage generates the initial set of vertices in the graph, which are used to find an initial guide path.   2) Sparse Edge Addition: This stage adds sparse edges to the graph. Algorithm 2 outlines the AddSparseEdges function. In order to add a sparse edge between vertices that are s layers away, the Linkable function checks if the robot can move between the configurations within the time budget. In our implementation, Linkable assumes linear movements in joint space and checks if a linear movement is within the robot’s joint velocity limit. In addition, the algorithm checks whether the two vertices are already connected by dense edges. If a path composed of dense edges connects the two vertices and its cost is similar to the cost of the sparse edge, it suggests that the area has already been sufficiently sampled, eliminating   3) Guide Path Search: A guide path is identified by finding the lowest cost path from the first to the last layer of the graph, using both dense and sparse edges. Specific graph search algorithms discussed in §III-B3 can be used to find the path with the lowest cost.   4) Additional Vertex Sampling: This stage takes a guide path as input and biases sampling toward it. As shown in Algorithm 3, this stage first samples around every sparse edge within the guide path, then randomly samples an equivalent amount of IK solutions. Sampling around the sparse edges allows them to be replaced by dense edges.   In order to sample around a sparse edge, we linearly inter- polate joint configurations on the sparse edge (LinInterp), apply some random disturbance (AddRandDelta), and use it as starting configurations of an IK solver. The IK solver finds IK solutions near the starting configuration. We use RelaxedIK [17] in our implementation, but any other IK solvers mentioned in §III-B1 are also compatible.   In order to randomly sample IK solutions across the entire trajectory, we first randomly select waypoints using Softmax, which assigns higher selection probabilities to waypoints with fewer randomly sampled IK solutions.   where x is the waypoint index, and |Vr[x]| is the number of existing randomly sampled IK solutions for waypoint x. After selecting a waypoint, we generate a random IK solution by initiating an IK solver’s starting configuration at a random location (RandConfig) in the robot’s joint space.   5) Dense Edge Addition: This stage adds dense edges to the graph, which connect vertices in adjacent layers. As detailed in Algorithm 4, the procedure involves iterating over all pairs of vertices located on adjacent layers. The algorithm uses the Linkable function to check the feasibility of each pair. After adding dense edges, the algorithm identifies and removes the sparse edges that have been superseded by dense edges. Specifically, if there exists a path composed of dense edges that connects the two endpoint vertices of a sparse edge, and the path’s cost is similar to the sparse edge’s cost, maintaining the sparse edge becomes unnecessary. Our approach shares a similar idea with lazy planning [19], [20], which delays the evaluation of edges until they are necessary for the solution. In our approach, sparse edges serve as estimators and a more accurate cost is computed when replacing sparse edges with dense edges.   6) Solution Search: This stage identifies a solution by finding the lowest cost path from the first to the last layer, using only dense edges. Specific graph search approaches described in §III-B3 can be used to find the shortest path. The identified solution corresponds to a motion that accurately tracks every waypoint on the reference trajectory.   V. EXPERIMENTS In this section, we compare our proposed algorithm frame- work with the two baseline approaches described in §III: the conventional sequential framework and the naïve anytime framework. We conducted three independent experiments in   simulation, each involves two testbeds. The first testbed tracks 10 randomly generated trajectories, comparing our frame- work with various parameter settings (step size s=3, 5, or 10) against the baselines. The second testbed tracks a trajectory 10 times and we report the average, best, and worst motions gen- erated by each method to provide a comprehensive overview of the performance variations.   Our implementation is based on the open source IKLink library in Rust. We note that the Rust implementation per- forms faster than the implementation evaluated in the original paper [4]. Our framework used md=5, δ=0.2, η=1.1 (across all experiments), m0=50 (Experiments A&B) and m0=500 (Experiment C). All evaluations were performed on a laptop with an Intel i7-11800H 2.30 GHz CPU and 16 GB of RAM.   We apply our framework to the Stampede algorithm [1] to find robot motions that track end-effector trajectories with minimal joint movements. As proposed in the original pa- per, Stampede used the conventional sequential framework. Stampede samples IK solutions by initiating an optimization- based IK solver, RelaxedIK [17], with starting configurations sampled from a uniform distribution. Additionally, it uses value iteration for graph search. Since our objective is to minimize joint movements, we define the edge weights within the graph as the Euclidean distances in joint space between two joint configurations.   This experiment uses a 7-degrees-of-freedom KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The first testbed tracks 10 random cumulative cubic Bézier curves [22] for smooth position and orientation changes. These trajectories have an average length of 1.26 m, an average angular displacement of 5.13 rad, and an average of 379.4 waypoints. The second testbed replicates a writing task from prior work [3], [11], where the robot traces a “hello” trajectory. The trajectory is rescaled to fit iiwa’s workspace.   As shown in the left column of Figure 3, while all three approaches generated motions with similar joint movements, our framework achieved initial solutions 2× faster. The results show that our heuristic is effective for simple trajectories and enables fast identification of effective motions. B. Experiment B - Tracking with Minimal Reconfigurations   We apply our framework to the IKLink algorithm [4] which utilizes the conventional sequential framework to track the end-effector trajectory of any complexity. If a reference trajectory is too complex to be tracked as a single, continuous path, IKLink generates motions with minimal reconfigurations. In addition, IKLink has a secondary objective of minimizing joint movements. Similar to Stampede, IKLink uses RelaxedIK [17] to uniformly sample IK solutions. It also leverages RelaxedIK’s velocity regularization to find IK solutions close to those in the previous layer, thereby generating smooth motions. Moreover, similar IK solutions are merged using a clustering method. IKLink finds motions using dynamic programming, which incorporates both the number of recon- figurations and joint movements as objectives.   This experiment uses a 7-DoF Franka Panda robot. The first testbed tracks random trajectories that consist of two con- secutive cubic cumulative Bézier curves [22]. The trajectories average 2.26 m in length, 12.07 rad in angular displacement, and 677.6 waypoints. The second testbed involves a 3D scanning task, in which a robot accurately moves a sensor along a predefined trajectory, ensuring the sensor consistently points at the object.   As shown in Figure 3, our framework was more efficient and converged to motions with fewer or equal configurations, compared to both the conventional framework (baseline 1) and the naïve anytime framework (baseline 2). C. Experiment C - Tracking Trajectories with Tolerances   In this experiment, we show how our framework ex- tends IKLink’s capability [4] to track semi-constrained end- effector trajectories. IKLink was originally designed for fully- constrained trajectory tracking, which requires all 6 DoF of   the end-effector to be accurate. This requirement becomes overly restrictive in applications such as welding, where the torch may rotate around its principal axis. In contrast, semi-constrained trajectory tracking allows the end-effector to move within certain tolerances. Semi-constrained tracking poses a greater challenge to graph-based approaches because the solution space is larger and requires more samplings to sufficiently cover the solution space. We demonstrate that the IKLink using the conventional framework struggles to quickly find plausible motions, and the proposed anytime framework enables IKLinks to efficiently and effectively track trajectory with tolerances. We use RangedIK [23] as the IK solver, which is an extension of RelaxedIK that generates IK solutions that move the end-effector within specified tolerances.   The first testbed randomly generates 10 welding trajectories for a Franka Panda robot. Each trajectory is composed of four cumulative cubic Bézier curves [22]. The trajectories average 1.29 m in length, 22.70 rad in angular displacement, and 646.8 waypoints. Compared to the random trajectories in Experiments A and B, these trajectories involve more rotational movements. In the welding task, the tolerance is along the torch’s principal axis, i.e., the robot is allowed to freely rotate its end-effector along the principal axis (z-axis). As shown in Figure 3, the principal axis is angled 45 degrees   from the robot’s last axis. The robot must coordinate the movement of all its joints to exploit the tolerance, in contrast to just rotating the last joint when the principal axis aligns with the last axis. In the second testbed, a 7-degrees-of-freedom Rethink Robotics Sawyer robot performs a sanding task by tracking a spiral trajectory. The robot can freely rotate the sanding tool around its principal axis, which is oriented 90 degrees from the robot’s last axis.   As shown in Figure 3, our framework enabled IKLink to quickly find motions with fewer reconfigurations than the baseline frameworks, while IKLink with both the conventional and naïve anytime frameworks struggled to find optimal solu- tions for trajectories with tolerances.   Summary: Across all experiments, our anytime framework requires less computation time to achieve motions of the same quality and reaches equal or better motion quality within the same time frame compared to both the conventional and naïve anytime frameworks. Figure 3 shows that our framework consistently outperforms the baselines (our lines are consis- tently below or overlapping with the baselines), while Table I presents the corresponding quantitative results.   them to find motions of higher or equal quality in less time, in comparison to both the conventional and naïve anytime frameworks. Experiment C shows that our framework extends IKLink’s ability to efficiently generate motions for tracking semi-constrained trajectories.   Our results also show the effects of the hyperparameter step size s, which defines the length of sparse edges. A smaller s increases the number of IK samples in Stage 1, sparse vertex sampling, thereby raising computation time for obtaining initial solutions. Meanwhile, a larger s reduces the accuracy of guide paths as cost estimators, leading to slower algorithm convergence. In our experiments, we observe a sweetspot at s=5.   VI. DISCUSSION This section summarizes the limitations, implications, and   conclusions of our work.   Limitations: Our work has several limitations that suggest future research directions. First, our algorithm lacks a quality- based stopping threshold; users can specify the maximum number of iterations, running time, or sampling budget, but the algorithm does not automatically stop upon convergence. Future work should explore the effects of adaptive stopping thresholds such as when the guide path no longer updates with iterations. Second, our method uses a heuristic to bias sam- pling in graph-based approaches. While we provide empirical evidence to demonstrate its ability to efficiently produce high- quality solutions, we cannot guarantee consistent performance across all scenarios. In certain scenarios, the heuristic may be misleading, causing the method to be slower than the naive anytime framework. Future work may provide a more rigorous understanding of the heuristic’s effectiveness. Third, while we expect that our framework generalizes across many graph-based tracking algorithms, we have only demonstrated it on two. Finally, the present work does not consider dynamic constraints, focusing solely on the velocity constraints of robot joints. Future work should consider incorporating acceleration constraints and the inertia of the robot to improve the quality of generated motions.   Implications: The guided anytime framework presented in this work enables graph-based approaches to efficiently and effectively find motions that accurately move a manipulator’s end-effector along reference trajectories. It quickly generates initial solutions and continues to refine them as needed. We have demonstrated that it accelerates and improves solutions over prior methods and enables solving problems that a prior method cannot. The proposed framework is particularly bene- ficial for scenarios where end-effector trajectories are complex or have specific tolerances.   Conclusion: This paper presented an anytime framework that enables graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms to efficiently and effectively find robot motions. Our framework generates trajectories of equal or better quality in less time than previous approaches.",

However, we are at the limit of how small computer\nchips can be in order to work reliably, continuing to depend on longer wait times and\npower draws. Exploring alternative solutions, researchers have shown that spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs) outperform conventional static artificial neural networks (ANNs) [2] in\nenergy efficiency when running models on neuromorphic chips [3], offering a remarkable\nreduction in energy consumption from 100 times [4] to 280 times [5].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nSpiking networks have also shown the ability to self-optimize to changing probability\ndistributions, such as the likelihood of a reward [6] and the adaptability of a dynamic motor\ncontrol system to a changing environment [7].

Noise also influences the synchronization of inputs and\ninhibition, which is crucial because the synchronous input is propagated more strongly [19,20].\nNoise in biological networks can be attributed to individual neurons and the behavior of a\nnetwork as a whole. Neuron-specific additive noise is independent of input strength and\nincludes thermal noise and fluctuations in neural membrane conductivity [18,19]. These can\nbe modeled by fluctuating the spike threshold (escape noise), fluctuating any parameter (slow\nnoise), or as an added current (diffusive Gaussian white noise) [19].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe multiplicative noise is proportional to the input and is attributed to the whole\nnetwork rather than an individual neuron. This noise originates from synaptic transmission\nfailures [19] and is modeled in this work as input-scaled Gaussian white noise. Other\narchitecture-attributed fluctuations originate in fixed random connectivity of neurons [19].\nIn this work, we compare the effect of additive white noise, additive Ornstein–Uhlenbeck\n(OU) colored noise [21], and multiplicative white noise on the adaptability of the SNN.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe dynamical synapses regulate the neural connection strength depending on the\nrecent activity: the connection strength increases with recent stimulation and depresses\nwhen not activated. In biological networks, dynamical synapses are crucial in implementing\nplasticity, adaptation, and learning. They enable the detection of temporal patterns, filter\nhigh-frequency noise, and drive neural synchronization [19].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe main parameter of the dynamical synapse is the synaptic time constant, τsyn.\nA higher synaptic time constant means the synapse integrates information over a longer\nperiod; a lower τsyn gives more rapid dynamics. In this work, we look at different values of\nτsyn. Although parameter tuning (signal gain, τsyn) challenges the convertibility of dynami-\ncal synapse network models, we show that the inherent robustness of our spiking network\nmitigates the need for extensive optimization. The intrinsic adaptability of our spiking\nnetwork allows it to maintain functionality even with suboptimal parameter configurations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.5**\n2.

The non-leaky SNN is simulated in C++ with the same parameters.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.3**\nThe leaky neurons’ membrane potential is defined by\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.4**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.4**r== 0.2**\n= −Vm(t) + Ibias + I(t) + I(t)ξmul(t) + ξ add(t) + z(t),\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nIbias is the base current (18 pA) plus the biases set by the network architecture;\nI(t) is the postsynaptic input current;\nξmul and ξ add is Gaussian white noise generated from the probability density function\nf (x) of normal distribution with 0 mean and standard deviation D:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nz(t) is the colored noise implemented with the Orstein–Uhlenbeck process [21]. z(t) is\ndefined with Gaussian noise ξ(t) and the damping term a as\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe white noise is implemented with the numpy.random.default_rng().normal function.\nIt can be applied directly as additive noise (ξ add), or it can be scaled by input values to\nmimic synaptic multiplicative noise (I(t)ξmul), that is, accumulated voltage that did not\ngenerate a spike [19]. Although different types of noise are introduced together in the same\nEquation (1), in the experiments they were applied individually for comparison.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nUnlike unpredictable white noise, the colored noise of the Orstein–Uhlenbeck (OU)\nprocess [21] has a non-uniform power spectral density: its values depend on the pre-\nvious values. The OU process is implemented with the discrete-time approximation of\nEquation (3) with the damping term (mean-reversion rate) θ = a/τ_z. The mean-reversion\nrate describes how fast the process converges to the selected mean 0. A lower θ increases\nthe autocorrelation of the process. See Figure S1 for sample noise patterns.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nNoise is applied only to the input neurons. This noise can be common (identical)\nacross both inputs or independent (different noise values drawn from the same distribu-\ntion). A new noise value is sampled every 0.1 ms, which is the temporal resolution of\nthe simulation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThere are fundamental differences in how noise affects the two networks. In the SNN,\nnoise continuously interacts with the network’s dynamics, influencing synchronization\nand inhibition before the final spike number is counted. However, in the ANN, negative\nactivations are suppressed by the ReLU activation function, and the effect of the noise is\nmitigated by averaging the output.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.2**\n3.

For ex-\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nample, in Figure 2 (right), we have 95.5% for (b, h) = (0.36, 0.5). The optimal boundary in\nSNN would greatly depend on the preset parameters: input gain, weight gain, synaptic\ntime constant of a dynamical synapse, and noise level. The linearity of the ANN circuit\nsolution peaks at 83.74% and produces low variability in accuracy for most boundaries.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nIt is possible to achieve high accuracy (up to 100%) in an ANN circuit for the analog\nXOR task with a sigmoidal activation function rather than ReLU by applying another layer\nwith a steep sigmoid function to the inputs, which would digitize the analog signal xi to\n0 or 1. Insofar as xi is an analog signal between [0, 1], and the ANN structure consists of\nfive neurons as in Figure 1, the ANN XOR recognition accuracy remains low regardless of\nthe activation function. However, the SNN of the similar minimal structure is sufficient for\nthe analog XOR task.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 3 shows the accuracy changes with common noise for some selected boundaries.\nFour boundaries are shown in both graphs: the yellow (b, h) = (0.46, 0.3) is optimal in ANN;\nthe magenta (b, h) = (0.4, 0.5) is the most optimal in SNN; the red (b, h) = (0.42, 0.4) is an\nexample of reaching optimal accuracy with some noise; the dark blue (b, h) = (0.46, 0.2) is a\nrandom sample.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 3.

In the non-spiking circuit of Figure 3 left, each input is tested\nwith 20,000 different noise components drawn from the same distribution, and then all\n20,000 trials are averaged for a single output. The same operation is repeated 20 times for\neach noise level D to have more samples for the average accuracy result. The spiking circuit\n(Figure 3 right) is simulated for 20 s per input, with a new noise component added every\n0.1 ms (NEST resolution setting), with a total of 200,000 noise components per input. This\nis repeated 20 times for each noise level D. Since the accuracy is measured on normalized\ndata, the standard deviation of the average accuracy is low.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 3 shows that the current implementation of the circuits gives (1) some improved\naccuracy for certain boundaries due to the non-linear separation of the output (Figure 2),\n(2) the noise effect is more dramatic in the SNN than in the ANN, and (3) some boundaries\ncan have the accuracy improved with noise.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.2**\n3.2.

Increasing the synaptic\ntime constant τsyn extends the amount of time it takes to decay the synapse strength back\nto its resting state after a presynaptic spike [23], thus allowing the circuit to integrate input\nover a longer period.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nWhen τsyn is high, as in Figure 4 center, the output neuron has a high contrast firing\nfrequency, compared to the lower τsyn = 1 ms in Figure 2 right and τsyn = 5 ms in Figure 4 left.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 4.

All synapse configurations show\nmoderate stochastic resonance with a shift in sensitivity to lower boundaries; however,\nthe dynamical synapse with a high synaptic time constant maintains sharper contrast in\nthe firing rates, which would allow it to perform more reliably even at high-intensity noise.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 5.

Although the static synapse network still exhibits up to 3% improve-\nment attributed to noise for the suboptimal boundaries, the dynamical synapse shows\na more measurable and predictable pattern in improving the accuracy for suboptimal\nboundaries with stronger noise. With dynamical synapses, we have 7% improvement for\nthe more optimal boundary (orange) and 17% improved accuracy for the least optimal\nboundary (purple).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 6.

Improving Accuracy for Sub-Optimal Boundaries in Leaky Dynamic SNN with Noise-Induced\nStochastic Resonance\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe noise component can be common between both inputs or independent. With com-\nmon noise, a single value is pulled from the normal distribution and applied to both inputs.\nIndependent noise implies pulling two different noise values from the distribution, one for\neach input.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe noise component can also be additive or multiplicative. While both additive and\nmultiplicative noise are technically “added” as a fluctuating current, multiplicative noise is\nscaled by the original inputs and the input gain values; the additive noise is not scaled by\ngain and is applied uniformly. The multiplicative noise is stronger than the additive noise\nby a factor of the input gain value in high inputs (which are closer to 1), but the inputs that\nare closer to 0 generate low noise.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 7 shows the firing rates in networks with different types of strong independent\nnoise. Each noise raises the firing rates in the circuit but at a different rate. Given the same\nparameters (0 mean, D standard deviation), the OU-colored noise is the most powerful\nand should be applied at a lower intensity. The multiplicative noise has a stronger shift\nin sensitivity to the weaker input than the additive noise while maintaining clear non-\nlinear separation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 8 follows the boundaries that were found to be the most accurate at each\nintensity of additive (Figure 8 left) and colored noise (Figure 8 right). Both white and colored\nnoise drastically improve the accuracy for the suboptimal boundaries due to stochastic\nresonance. Although additive noise shows slow improvement with high intensity, colored\nnoise has a much stronger effect with the same standard deviation D, and the accuracy\ndegrades faster after peaking.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 7.

Both additive and multiplicative noise have a similar effect on the\ncurrent network. However, compared to additive and colored noise, multiplicative noise\nreaches near-optimal scores with lower noise and produces higher accuracies per node\noverall. For example, at D = 5 of multiplicative noise (Figure 9 right), the suboptimal\nboundaries reach between 92–95% accuracy, the additive noise requires a higher D for\nsimilar results, and the colored noise accuracy peaks at 87–93%.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 9 compares the effects of common and independent noise on suboptimal\nboundaries. The chart shows some boundaries found to be most accurate at each noise level\nand follows changes in their accuracy. Independent noise gives slightly more improvement\nthan common noise at first, but the trend reverses for less optimal boundaries with high\nnoise intensity (Figure 9 left). Strong common noise is more effective than the independent\nnoise for the boundaries where the model is not optimized, for example, the black boundary\n(b, h) = (0.36, 0.4).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe accuracy gap between the common and independent noisy networks increases\nwith a higher D as a result of more variation among the individual noise components. This\ngap is minimal with a high synaptic time constant in Figure 9 right.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nFigure 9.

Discussion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nIn artificial networks, the ability to adapt is another way (besides neuromorphic\nhardware) to reduce the power consumption during a model’s training and inference.\nIn biological networks, the ability to adapt to changing or missing input is embedded in the\nbrain’s regime of stable propagation of synchronous neural activity among asynchronous\nglobal activity [20,24], a combination of rate and temporal coding [25]. The physical\nproperties that contribute to temporal coding are inhibitory connections (feedback) [17],\nthe presence of noise [26], and the short-term plasticity of dynamical synapses [23,27].\nThese properties are usually omitted from the standard conversion method based on the\nANN-to-SNN rate coding [4,8,28]. This work implemented temporal features in the XOR\nnetwork in the form of multiplicative synaptic noise and dynamical synapses to discuss\ntheir effects on adaptation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe implementation of temporal features in the SNN introduces notable network\ntranslation challenges, especially if we seek to apply these results to “convert” existing well-\nperforming ANNs to SNN. The gain parameters for SNN have to be re-selected depending\non the synaptic time constant of the dynamical synapse. To make the circuits equivalent\nand convertible, firing frequency/activations have to be aligned, the ANN activations’\noutput has to have a similar shape to that of an SNN (non-linear separation), implying an\narchitectural change; a parameter selection rule has to be established, such that the same\nboundary is returned as the most optimal.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAlthough ANN models can benefit from noisy training [29], the current set-up showed\na minimal noise-induced stochastic resonance effect in ANN. In SNN, noise interacts with\nneurons’ internal dynamics, and we have more measurable changes with stronger noise\nwhen the network is not optimally tuned. We have also shown that the spiking network\nwith multiplicative noise has increased sensitivity to sub-optimal inputs, which can be\napplied as an adaptation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe noise types applied in this work show a similar effect, which is likely to be more\nvaried in a larger network. The noisy SNN stochastic resonance presented in this work\nimplies that only the suboptimal boundaries that can be helped by amplifying the firing\nfrequency will be improved. This poses a question for implementing noise with inverse\neffects that would weaken the firing frequency in stronger inputs and adjust the circuit for\nhigher boundaries instead.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nThe functionality of a noisy SNN XOR could also be expanded to other functions by\nimplementing other temporal characteristics in the form of inhibitory neuron pools [30],\nfeedback loops, or taking into account the synchronization index [25].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https:\n//www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/e27030219/s1, Figure S1: Sample noise values for one hundred\ntime intervals; Figure S2: Relative firing rate in non-leaky SNN XOR at different intensity levels of\ncommon multiplicative white noise.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.G., S.Y. and Y.K.; methodology, Y.G.; software, Y.G.\nand S.Y.; validation, S.Y. and Y.K.; resources, Y.G. and S.Y.; writing—original draft preparation, Y.G.;\nwriting—review and editing, Y.G. and S.Y.; supervision, S.Y. and Y.K.

In this paper, a spiking neural network utilizes biological temporal coding features in the form of noise-induced stochastic resonance and dynamical synapses to increase the model’s performance when its parameters are not optimized for a given input. Using the analog XOR task as a simplified convolutional neural network model, this paper demonstrates two key results: (1) SNNs solve the problem that is linearly inseparable in ANN with fewer neurons, and (2) in leaky SNNs, the addition of noise and dynamical synapses compensate for non-optimal parameters, achieving near-optimal results for weaker inputs.   Keywords: spiking neural networks; adaptability; noise; stochastic resonance; dynamical synapse; leaky integrate-and-fire neuron   AI training and inference servers’ power consumption is kept at bay with tensor processing units (TPUs), shortening the circuit paths and processing data locally rather than spending energy on transit [1]. However, we are at the limit of how small computer chips can be in order to work reliably, continuing to depend on longer wait times and power draws. Exploring alternative solutions, researchers have shown that spiking neural networks (SNNs) outperform conventional static artificial neural networks (ANNs) [2] in energy efficiency when running models on neuromorphic chips [3], offering a remarkable reduction in energy consumption from 100 times [4] to 280 times [5].   Spiking networks have also shown the ability to self-optimize to changing probability distributions, such as the likelihood of a reward [6] and the adaptability of a dynamic motor control system to a changing environment [7]. This paper shows that noise sensitivity in SNNs with dynamical synapses leads to surprisingly better performance than ANNs when parameters are not fully optimized.   Unlike ANNs, training the synaptic weights of SNNs is challenging due to the instanta- neous spiking activity and dynamic synaptic characteristics that hinder gradient computation. Several methods exist to achieve trained SNNs. One method is to obtain synaptic weights by ANN backpropagation and directly apply them to SNN [8]. SNNs can also be trained directly with supervised learning error-based methods , resulting in faster convergence and many possible solutions [9]. Examples include SNN backpropagation [10], hybrid learning of STDP-based unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning [11], and an approxi- mation of backpropagation with dendritic cortical microcircuits [12]. Other approaches for supervised learning in SNNs are the target propagation methods, which result in a constrained   solution [9]. For example, there is a method of target propagation based on the Gauss–Newton optimization [13] and a gradient-free training method for SNN [14].   In order to compare the adaptability of ANN and SNN models, we create two similarly structured networks designed to run the analog XOR function. The goal of the analog XOR task is to check if the inputs are within a certain range of each other; if they are, then the output is low; otherwise, it is high.   The analog XOR task is a non-linear operation and a fundamental building block in neural networks. It is a simple way to analyze the internal processes of networks that can be generalized to aspects of convolutional neural networks, audio processing, and sensor systems [15,16]. Specifically, in both CNN kernels [16] and biological visual processing [17], XOR, in conjunction with logical negation NOT or inhibitory mechanisms, such as lateral inhibition and feedback loops, can approximate functions such as feature extraction and contrast enhancement.   Unlike pioneering ANN-to-SNN network translation research [4,8], our spiking net-   work utilizes temporal coding features: the presence of noise and dynamical synapses.   Noise plays an important role in biological networks, improving the adaptability of a network [18]; it stimulates the effect of stochastic resonance by boosting the near-threshold voltage and generating a spike [19]. Noise also influences the synchronization of inputs and inhibition, which is crucial because the synchronous input is propagated more strongly [19,20]. Noise in biological networks can be attributed to individual neurons and the behavior of a network as a whole. Neuron-specific additive noise is independent of input strength and includes thermal noise and fluctuations in neural membrane conductivity [18,19]. These can be modeled by fluctuating the spike threshold (escape noise), fluctuating any parameter (slow noise), or as an added current (diffusive Gaussian white noise) [19].   The multiplicative noise is proportional to the input and is attributed to the whole network rather than an individual neuron. This noise originates from synaptic transmission failures [19] and is modeled in this work as input-scaled Gaussian white noise. Other architecture-attributed fluctuations originate in fixed random connectivity of neurons [19]. In this work, we compare the effect of additive white noise, additive Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) colored noise [21], and multiplicative white noise on the adaptability of the SNN.   The dynamical synapses regulate the neural connection strength depending on the recent activity: the connection strength increases with recent stimulation and depresses when not activated. In biological networks, dynamical synapses are crucial in implementing plasticity, adaptation, and learning. They enable the detection of temporal patterns, filter high-frequency noise, and drive neural synchronization [19].   The main parameter of the dynamical synapse is the synaptic time constant, τsyn. A higher synaptic time constant means the synapse integrates information over a longer period; a lower τsyn gives more rapid dynamics. In this work, we look at different values of τsyn. Although parameter tuning (signal gain, τsyn) challenges the convertibility of dynami- cal synapse network models, we show that the inherent robustness of our spiking network mitigates the need for extensive optimization. The intrinsic adaptability of our spiking network allows it to maintain functionality even with suboptimal parameter configurations.   2. Materials and Methods 2.1. The Analog XOR Task   We define the analog XOR task for SNNs using the analog input signal (x0, x1) ∈ [0, 1] and the analog spike count CT within the time frame T of the output spiking neuron (N5) as follows: CT   N5 will exceed the firing threshold h when exactly one of the inputs (x0, x1) is greater   than or equal to a boundary value b (see the algorithm Table 1).   The final values of the output neuron CT   N5 are normalized such that h ∈ (0.00, 1.00). The normalization of the final output is used to compare the models, since ANN activations and the SNN spike count are not guaranteed to be proportionally aligned, which depends on other gain and the synaptic time-constant parameters.   The accuracy of the XOR task for an SNN circuit is calculated using the digitized N5) − h), where Θ is the Heaviside   variables (Θ(x0 − b), Θ(x1 − b)) and (Θ(normalized(CT step function, and Θ(i) = 1 and 0 for i > 0, and i ≤ 0, respectively.   We find the boundaries (b, h) and parameters with a grid search. First, we searched for the gain parameters with a fixed boundary on ANN and then tuned the boundary with another grid search of (b, h). One of the best-found boundaries in ANN is (b, h) = (0.46, 0.3) with an 83.74% accuracy. Due to the structure in the output activations of the ANN XOR circuit, many boundaries yield similar accuracy. The same gain parameters did not work for the SNN with τsyn = 1 ms, and we applied another grid search for parameters given the boundary (b, h) = (0.46, 0.3). The gain parameters that worked best for SNN with τsyn = 1 are (input gain, weight gain) = (5, 110) or (6, 111). Due to the steps in the grid search and the bias gain parameter set to 1, the returned setting is not guaranteed to be the most optimal.   After finding the optimal boundaries, we observed how the circuit performed with   noise added for suboptimal boundaries.   The ANN and SNN circuits have two input neurons, two hidden-layer neurons,   and one output neuron (Figure 1).   The input and connection weights of the circuits are scaled by the input gain and weight gain; the bias gain is set to 1. The ReLU activation in the ANN circuit is chosen based on previous research of the ANN-to-SNN translation method: ReLU neurons are a good approximation of discrete spikes and are efficient during training [8].   2.3. Implementation of Noisy Spiking Neurons   The spiking circuit is simulated with NEST 2.20.1 [22], consisting of leaky integrate- and-fire iaf_psc_exp neurons with a dynamical synapse model tsodyks_synapse [23] and the parameters listed in Table 2.   refractory_input   tau_fac   tau_rec   tau_syn   Membrane capacitance, pF Membrane time constant, ms Resting membrane potential, mV Initial membrane potential, mV Reset potential of the membrane, mV Lowest value for the membrane potential Discard input during refractory period Constant input current, pA Spike threshold, mV Synapse facilitation time constant, ms Synapse recovery time constant, ms Synaptic time constant (τsyn), ms Simulation resolution, ms Simulation time, s   We selected the leaky model for this work due to its biological plausibility [19] and higher susceptibility to stochastic resonance compared to a non-leaky neuron. We have tested the firing rate of the non-leaky neuron with static synapse at different noise levels (see Figure S2). Unlike leaky SNN, static non-leaky SNN produced ANN-like output with higher noise intensity. The non-leaky SNN is simulated in C++ with the same parameters.   The leaky neurons’ membrane potential is defined by   = −Vm(t) + Ibias + I(t) + I(t)ξmul(t) + ξ add(t) + z(t),   Ibias is the base current (18 pA) plus the biases set by the network architecture; I(t) is the postsynaptic input current; ξmul and ξ add is Gaussian white noise generated from the probability density function f (x) of normal distribution with 0 mean and standard deviation D:   z(t) is the colored noise implemented with the Orstein–Uhlenbeck process [21]. z(t) is defined with Gaussian noise ξ(t) and the damping term a as   The white noise is implemented with the numpy.random.default_rng().normal function. It can be applied directly as additive noise (ξ add), or it can be scaled by input values to mimic synaptic multiplicative noise (I(t)ξmul), that is, accumulated voltage that did not generate a spike [19]. Although different types of noise are introduced together in the same Equation (1), in the experiments they were applied individually for comparison.   Unlike unpredictable white noise, the colored noise of the Orstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process [21] has a non-uniform power spectral density: its values depend on the pre- vious values. The OU process is implemented with the discrete-time approximation of Equation (3) with the damping term (mean-reversion rate) θ = a/τ_z. The mean-reversion rate describes how fast the process converges to the selected mean 0. A lower θ increases the autocorrelation of the process. See Figure S1 for sample noise patterns.   Noise is applied only to the input neurons. This noise can be common (identical) across both inputs or independent (different noise values drawn from the same distribu- tion). A new noise value is sampled every 0.1 ms, which is the temporal resolution of the simulation.   There are fundamental differences in how noise affects the two networks. In the SNN, noise continuously interacts with the network’s dynamics, influencing synchronization and inhibition before the final spike number is counted. However, in the ANN, negative activations are suppressed by the ReLU activation function, and the effect of the noise is mitigated by averaging the output.   3. Results 3.1. Networks Output Comparison: Non-Linear Separability with Fewer Neurons   The ANN of the given circuit structure returns the linear separation of the solution field (Figure 2), while the SNN produces a non-linear solution with the same number of neurons.   The SNN XOR can give high-accuracy results at 95% or more with only five neurons. However, this success would only apply to a couple of specific decision boundaries. For ex-   ample, in Figure 2 (right), we have 95.5% for (b, h) = (0.36, 0.5). The optimal boundary in SNN would greatly depend on the preset parameters: input gain, weight gain, synaptic time constant of a dynamical synapse, and noise level. The linearity of the ANN circuit solution peaks at 83.74% and produces low variability in accuracy for most boundaries.   It is possible to achieve high accuracy (up to 100%) in an ANN circuit for the analog XOR task with a sigmoidal activation function rather than ReLU by applying another layer with a steep sigmoid function to the inputs, which would digitize the analog signal xi to 0 or 1. Insofar as xi is an analog signal between [0, 1], and the ANN structure consists of five neurons as in Figure 1, the ANN XOR recognition accuracy remains low regardless of the activation function. However, the SNN of the similar minimal structure is sufficient for the analog XOR task.   Figure 3 shows the accuracy changes with common noise for some selected boundaries. Four boundaries are shown in both graphs: the yellow (b, h) = (0.46, 0.3) is optimal in ANN; the magenta (b, h) = (0.4, 0.5) is the most optimal in SNN; the red (b, h) = (0.42, 0.4) is an example of reaching optimal accuracy with some noise; the dark blue (b, h) = (0.46, 0.2) is a random sample.   Both charts show an average accuracy over 20 runs, where noise values are generated with a new seed every run. In the non-spiking circuit of Figure 3 left, each input is tested with 20,000 different noise components drawn from the same distribution, and then all 20,000 trials are averaged for a single output. The same operation is repeated 20 times for each noise level D to have more samples for the average accuracy result. The spiking circuit (Figure 3 right) is simulated for 20 s per input, with a new noise component added every 0.1 ms (NEST resolution setting), with a total of 200,000 noise components per input. This is repeated 20 times for each noise level D. Since the accuracy is measured on normalized data, the standard deviation of the average accuracy is low.   Figure 3 shows that the current implementation of the circuits gives (1) some improved accuracy for certain boundaries due to the non-linear separation of the output (Figure 2), (2) the noise effect is more dramatic in the SNN than in the ANN, and (3) some boundaries can have the accuracy improved with noise.   3.2. Dynamical Synapses in Leaky SNN and Their Effect on Stochastic Resonance   Different from static synapses that have a fixed connection strength, dynamical synapses regulate their conductance based on the previous activity. Increasing the synaptic time constant τsyn extends the amount of time it takes to decay the synapse strength back to its resting state after a presynaptic spike [23], thus allowing the circuit to integrate input over a longer period.   When τsyn is high, as in Figure 4 center, the output neuron has a high contrast firing frequency, compared to the lower τsyn = 1 ms in Figure 2 right and τsyn = 5 ms in Figure 4 left.   Figure 5 shows the effect of strong common multiplicative noise on the output firing frequency in the SNN with dynamical and static synapses. All synapse configurations show moderate stochastic resonance with a shift in sensitivity to lower boundaries; however, the dynamical synapse with a high synaptic time constant maintains sharper contrast in the firing rates, which would allow it to perform more reliably even at high-intensity noise.   Figure 6 follows the accuracy for some boundaries that are found to be the best at each noise level. Although the static synapse network still exhibits up to 3% improve- ment attributed to noise for the suboptimal boundaries, the dynamical synapse shows a more measurable and predictable pattern in improving the accuracy for suboptimal boundaries with stronger noise. With dynamical synapses, we have 7% improvement for the more optimal boundary (orange) and 17% improved accuracy for the least optimal boundary (purple).   3.3. Improving Accuracy for Sub-Optimal Boundaries in Leaky Dynamic SNN with Noise-Induced Stochastic Resonance   The noise component can be common between both inputs or independent. With com- mon noise, a single value is pulled from the normal distribution and applied to both inputs. Independent noise implies pulling two different noise values from the distribution, one for each input.   The noise component can also be additive or multiplicative. While both additive and multiplicative noise are technically “added” as a fluctuating current, multiplicative noise is scaled by the original inputs and the input gain values; the additive noise is not scaled by gain and is applied uniformly. The multiplicative noise is stronger than the additive noise by a factor of the input gain value in high inputs (which are closer to 1), but the inputs that are closer to 0 generate low noise.   Figure 7 shows the firing rates in networks with different types of strong independent noise. Each noise raises the firing rates in the circuit but at a different rate. Given the same parameters (0 mean, D standard deviation), the OU-colored noise is the most powerful and should be applied at a lower intensity. The multiplicative noise has a stronger shift in sensitivity to the weaker input than the additive noise while maintaining clear non- linear separation.   Figure 8 follows the boundaries that were found to be the most accurate at each intensity of additive (Figure 8 left) and colored noise (Figure 8 right). Both white and colored noise drastically improve the accuracy for the suboptimal boundaries due to stochastic resonance. Although additive noise shows slow improvement with high intensity, colored noise has a much stronger effect with the same standard deviation D, and the accuracy degrades faster after peaking.   Figure 9 right (solid line) follows the same boundaries but with the addition of only multiplicative noise. Both additive and multiplicative noise have a similar effect on the current network. However, compared to additive and colored noise, multiplicative noise reaches near-optimal scores with lower noise and produces higher accuracies per node overall. For example, at D = 5 of multiplicative noise (Figure 9 right), the suboptimal boundaries reach between 92–95% accuracy, the additive noise requires a higher D for similar results, and the colored noise accuracy peaks at 87–93%.   Figure 9 compares the effects of common and independent noise on suboptimal boundaries. The chart shows some boundaries found to be most accurate at each noise level and follows changes in their accuracy. Independent noise gives slightly more improvement than common noise at first, but the trend reverses for less optimal boundaries with high noise intensity (Figure 9 left). Strong common noise is more effective than the independent noise for the boundaries where the model is not optimized, for example, the black boundary (b, h) = (0.36, 0.4).   The accuracy gap between the common and independent noisy networks increases with a higher D as a result of more variation among the individual noise components. This gap is minimal with a high synaptic time constant in Figure 9 right.   Even though the different types of noise have nuances in their effect, we have shown that noise makes the dynamical spiking network more sensitive to weaker input due to stochastic resonance, thus boosting the untuned dynamical spiking network’s performance to near-optimal levels.   In artificial networks, the ability to adapt is another way (besides neuromorphic hardware) to reduce the power consumption during a model’s training and inference. In biological networks, the ability to adapt to changing or missing input is embedded in the brain’s regime of stable propagation of synchronous neural activity among asynchronous global activity [20,24], a combination of rate and temporal coding [25]. The physical properties that contribute to temporal coding are inhibitory connections (feedback) [17], the presence of noise [26], and the short-term plasticity of dynamical synapses [23,27]. These properties are usually omitted from the standard conversion method based on the ANN-to-SNN rate coding [4,8,28]. This work implemented temporal features in the XOR network in the form of multiplicative synaptic noise and dynamical synapses to discuss their effects on adaptation.   The implementation of temporal features in the SNN introduces notable network translation challenges, especially if we seek to apply these results to “convert” existing well- performing ANNs to SNN. The gain parameters for SNN have to be re-selected depending on the synaptic time constant of the dynamical synapse. To make the circuits equivalent and convertible, firing frequency/activations have to be aligned, the ANN activations’ output has to have a similar shape to that of an SNN (non-linear separation), implying an architectural change; a parameter selection rule has to be established, such that the same boundary is returned as the most optimal.   Although ANN models can benefit from noisy training [29], the current set-up showed a minimal noise-induced stochastic resonance effect in ANN. In SNN, noise interacts with neurons’ internal dynamics, and we have more measurable changes with stronger noise when the network is not optimally tuned. We have also shown that the spiking network with multiplicative noise has increased sensitivity to sub-optimal inputs, which can be applied as an adaptation.   The noise types applied in this work show a similar effect, which is likely to be more varied in a larger network. The noisy SNN stochastic resonance presented in this work implies that only the suboptimal boundaries that can be helped by amplifying the firing frequency will be improved. This poses a question for implementing noise with inverse effects that would weaken the firing frequency in stronger inputs and adjust the circuit for higher boundaries instead.   The functionality of a noisy SNN XOR could also be expanded to other functions by implementing other temporal characteristics in the form of inhibitory neuron pools [30], feedback loops, or taking into account the synchronization index [25].",

Among  these  challenges,\ncoal  bursts  stand  out  as  a  significant  hazard  within\nthe  mining  sector,  often  leading  to  miner  casual-\nties  and  production  disruptions  (Shirani  Faradonbeh\net al. 2020; Wei et al. 2020, 2021; Zhang et al. 2017).\nThese events underscore the urgent need for detailed\nresearch into their underlying mechanisms. For exam-\nple,  in  the  Qianqiu  coal  mine  in  China,  a  coal  burst\nwas triggered by fault reactivation in November 2011\n(Cai  et  al.  2021).  Similarly,  the  No.  25110  working\nface  of  the  Yuejin  coal  mine  in  China  experienced\n20  coal  burst  incidents  due  to  the  proximity  of  min-\ning activities to the F16 fault (Li et al. 2014). These\ninstances  highlight  how  deep  mining  activities  can\nprovoke fault slips, thus heightening the risk of cata-\nstrophic events.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nCoal  mining  operations  in  China  are  advancing\nto  greater  depths  annually  at  a  rate  of  8–25  m,  pos-\ning increased risks of geological failures (Chen et al.\n2019; Xie et al.2019). Specifically, mining near fault\nlines has been linked to sudden failures of coal seams\nand  surrounding  rock  strata,  often  resulting  in  cata-\nstrophic roadway roof collapses due to intense strain\nenergy  releases  (Li  et  al.  2007;  Foulger  et  al.  2018;\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nWang  et  al.  2021;  Zhou  et  al.  2022).  As  of  the  end\nof  2022,  over  50  Chinese  coal  mines  have  exceeded\ndepths  of  1000  m,  with  the  deepest  extending  to\n1510 m (Kang et al. 2023).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nIn  applied  elasticity,  faults  can  be  treated  as  spe-\ncial boundary conditions. For mining operations near\nfaults,  the  interaction  process  can  be  distinctly  cat-\negorized  into  two  parts:  the  mining-induced  faulting\nprocess,  which  can  trigger  induced  earthquakes,  and\nthe  subsequent  impact  of  these  earthquakes  on  min-\ning  activities.  This  dual  interaction  underscores  the\ncomplex dynamics at play between mining operations\nand  fault  reactivation.  Insights  into  the  mechanisms\nof  fault  reactivation  and  the  resulting  coal  or  rock\nbursts have been extensively explored through a com-\nbination of in-situ observations, theoretical analyses,\nnumerical modeling, and experimental investigations\n(Li  et  al.  2024a,  2024b;  Shan  et  al.  2023;  Song  and\nLiang  2021;  Wu  et  al.  2021).  Investigating  mining-\ninduced  fault  coseismic  slip  is  essential  for  under-\nstanding  the  physical  processes  and  mechanisms  of\nmining-induced earthquakes and exploring the impact\nof stress disturbance on fault stability (Dong and Luo\n2022; Li 2024a, 2024b, 2025). Given that the faulting\ncaused by deep mining may lead to rock (coal) bursts,\nconsiderable  research  has  been  conducted  to  under-\nstand  the  mechanisms  underlying  mining-induced\nfault slip (Dong et al. 2023; Wei et al. 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nWhile  reservoir  studies  have  extensively  docu-\nmented the impact of reduced pore pressure on lower-\ning  effective  normal  stress,  such  considerations  have\nyet  to  be  thoroughly  explored  in  the  context  of  coal\nmining.  Decreases  in  effective  normal  stress,  signifi-\ncant  due  to  their  potential  to  trigger  earthquakes,  are\na  common  result  of  reservoir  depletion  (Buijze  et  al.\n2019; Ji et al. 2022; Rudnicki 2022). In contrast, previ-\nous research on the faulting processes in deep coal min-\ning  has  mainly  emphasized  the  concentration  of  shear\nstress,  with  less  attention  given  to  changes  in  normal\nstress  (Song  and  Liang  2021;  Jiao  et  al.  2021;  Zhang\net  al.  2023;  Zhu  et  al.  2021).  Our  research  challenges\nthis  perspective  by  demonstrating  that  reductions  in\nnormal stress on a fault also significantly contribute to\nfault  instability.  This  insight  is  grounded  in  the  appli-\ncation  of  the  3-D  Mohr–Coulomb  criterion,  which\nassesses the fault stress ratio—the ratio of shear stress\nto normal stress on the fault—against the fault frictional\nstrength (μs). Adhering to the Wallace-Bott hypothesis,\nwe assume that the direction of slip aligns with that of\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.5**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nGeomech. Geophys. Geo-energ.

Rec-\nognizing  that  mining  activities  modify  both  shear  and\nnormal  stresses  on  the  fault  underscores  the  impor-\ntance of evaluating the stress ratio, in addition to shear\nstress,  in  scenarios  of  mining-induced  earthquakes.  In\nmining-induced  fault-slip  scenarios,  previous  studies\nprimarily utilized a basic static-dynamic friction model\nwhich  overlooked  the  role  of  the  critical  slip  distance\nin  shaping  fault  slip  (Hoffmann  et  al.  2013;  Hofmann\nand Scheepers 2011). Subsequent research has demon-\nstrated that the critical slip distance significantly affects\nfault  slip  dynamics,  particularly  in  sublevel  stopping\nmining  scenarios  (Sainoki  and  Mitri  2014, 2015;  Sai-\nnoki et al. 2019; Yan et al. 2023, 2024a). Consequently,\nthis paper adopts a linear slip weakening law  to com-\nprehensively evaluate how critical slip distance impacts\nthe  characteristics  of  fault  coseismic  slip  as  mining\napproaches the fault.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nDeep  mining  operations  have  the  potential  to  reac-\ntivate  faults,  initiating  processes  such  as  fault  failure\nand coseismic slip. Notably, the magnitude of mining-\ninduced earthquakes is more strongly influenced by the\nextent of coseismic slip than by stress alone, underscor-\ning the necessity of a comprehensive investigation into\nboth  fault  failure  and  slip  dynamics.

This  increase  indicates  a\nheightened  fault  instability,  which  varies  footwall\nmining,  compared  to  hanging  wall  mining  at  the\nsame  absolute  mining  distance  (|Dm|),  resulting  in\na  larger  maximum  slip,  suggesting  an  asymmetric\nresponse  based  on  the  mining  side  relative  to  the\nfault.  Figure  7b  quantifies  the  lengths  of  slip  zones,\ndemonstrating that these zones expand or contract in\nresponse to Dm and μs. A notable trend is that larger\nμs values correlate with shorter slip zones, and zones\nnear the fault are larger, indicating that the proximity\nto the fault enhances slip zone extensions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nThe  analysis  reveals  that  slip  zone  lengths  are\ngenerally  larger  in  footwall  mining  than  in  hang-\ning wall mining, emphasizing the influence of min-\ning  location  on  seismic  risk.

Fig-\nure 8a and Fig. 8b represent the 2-D distribution of\nfault slip and normal stress, respectively. These dia-\ngrams  effectively  highlight  the  significant  decrease\nin  normal  stress  across  the  fault  plane,  notably\nwithin the pink zone identified as the normal stress\nrelease zone. This reduction is crucial, indicating a\nlocalized weakening of the fault plane, which could\npotentially  increase  the  likelihood  of  fault  slip.\nFigure  8c  further  elucidates  this  phenomenon  by\npresenting  normal  stress  curves  at  Ls = 600  m  and\nLd = 135  m,  situated  within  the  broader  context  of\nFig. 8b. These curves reveal a pronounced reduction\nin  normal  stress  from  an  initial  peak  of  approxi-\nmately  47  MPa  down  to  as  low  as  7  MPa.  This\ndramatic  drop  underscores  the  significant  impact\nof  mining  activities  on  stress  alteration,  thereby\nenhancing the potential for fault activation and slip\nin these regions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nFigure 8 captures the complex relationship between\nmining-induced  stress  modifications  and  faulting\nbehaviors.

Defined as the ratio of shear stress\nto normal stress on the fault plane, k is deeply rooted\nin  the  Mohr–Coulomb  failure  criterion.  Accord-\ning  to  this  criterion,  a  fault  is  expected  to  slip  when\nthe shear stress τ exceeds the critical value given by\nτ = μσn,  where  μ  is  the  friction  coefficient  represent-\ning the fault resistance to sliding.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nUnder  the  Mohr–Coulomb  criterion,  k  is  a  key\nmeasure of fault stability: When k < μ, the shear stress\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nis  below  the  fault  frictional  resistance,  indicating\nstability.  When  k ≥ μ,  the  shear  stress  surpasses  the\nfault  frictional  resistance,  leading  to  fault  reactiva-\ntion and potential slip. This comparison is crucial for\ndetermining the likelihood of fault slip under specific\nstress conditions, making k not only a vital indicator\nof fault stability but also a reliable predictor of fault\nslip.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nThe  slip  weakening  law  further  refines  the  analy-\nsis by introducing the dynamic evolution of the fric-\ntion  coefficient  during  slip,  where  μ  decreases  from\na  static  value  μs  to  a  lower  dynamic  value  μd.  This\nreduction  in  friction  reflects  the  weakening  behavior\nof the fault as slip progresses. k is first compared with\nthe μs to determine the onset of slip. As slip continues\nand the fault weakens, k is then compared with μd. If\nk remains higher than μd, slip will continue until the\nstress  is  redistributed  or  the  fault  stabilizes  (Fig.  9).\nThis framework allows for a more precise prediction\nof fault behavior under dynamic stress conditions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nTo  validate  the  reliability  of  the  k,  we  conducted\ndetailed comparisons between our model outputs and\ntheoretical analyses.

         " Quantitative 3‑D investigation of faulting in deep mining using Mohr–Coulomb criterion and slip weakening law   Abstract  Assessing  the  risk  of  fault-slip  rockburst is crucial for ensuring the safety of mining operations and  effectively  mitigating  potential  disasters.  In  this study, we propose an integrated 3-D numerical mod- eling  framework  combining  the  virtual  fault  (VF), 3-D  Mohr–Coulomb  criterion  model  (MC),  and  slip weakening  model  (SW)  to  investigate  the  dynamics of  fault  failure  and  coseismic  slip  induced  by  min- ing activities near faults. Our research focuses on the fault stress ratio (k) and how it responds to variables such  as  fault  dip  angle  (φ),  mining  distance  (Dm),   fault frictional parameters (μs, μd, and Dc), and panel length  (Wm)  within  a  depth-dependent  stress  field. Our findings demonstrate that the k serves as a criti- cal indicator of fault reactivity, with its sensitivity to φ  and  Dm,  significantly  heightening  the  potential  for seismic  activities.  We  found  that  footwall  mining, in  particular,  affects  fault  stability  more  than  hang- ing  wall  mining,  often  causing  greater  instability. Additionally,  decreases  in  normal  stress  due  to  min- ing  activities  are  found  to  be  crucial  in  triggering fault reactivation and coseismic slip. The SW model reveals  that  k  initially  decreases  with  increasing  slip and  stabilizes  as  slip  progresses,  highlighting  the critical  role  of  evolving  frictional  properties  in  fault stability.  Additionally,  this  study  confirms  that  min- ing-induced  fault  slips  exhibit  self-similar  behaviors analogous  to  natural  faulting,  with  a  proportional relationship between slip distribution and static stress drop,  validated  through  robust  numerical  analy- sis.  This  study  enhances  the  understanding  of  fault mechanics in mining-induced conditions and provides a robust framework for assessing seismic risks, offer- ing practical insights for improving safety and stabil- ity in deep mining operations.   •  Mining-induced  fault  slips  show  self-similar  pat- terns,  mirroring  natural  seismic  activity,  and  aid- ing risk assessment.   •  In reverse faults, mining proximity amplifies seis- mic  risks,  with  footwall  mining  being  the  most unstable.   •  Decreasing normal stress from mining operations is critical in triggering fault instability and coseis- mic slips.   Keywords  Mining-induced earthquakes · Rockburst · 3-D Mohr–Coulomb criterion · Fault slip · Slip weakening law   1  Introduction   Mining-induced  earthquakes  can  cause  substantial damage  to  mining  areas  and  nearby  human  activi- ties,  illustrating  the  ongoing  challenges  of  enhanc- ing safety and efficiency in coal mining (Kang et al. 2023;  Ranjith  et  al.  2017).  Among  these  challenges, coal  bursts  stand  out  as  a  significant  hazard  within the  mining  sector,  often  leading  to  miner  casual- ties  and  production  disruptions  (Shirani  Faradonbeh et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2020, 2021; Zhang et al. 2017). These events underscore the urgent need for detailed research into their underlying mechanisms. For exam- ple,  in  the  Qianqiu  coal  mine  in  China,  a  coal  burst was triggered by fault reactivation in November 2011 (Cai  et  al.  2021).  Similarly,  the  No.  25110  working face  of  the  Yuejin  coal  mine  in  China  experienced 20  coal  burst  incidents  due  to  the  proximity  of  min- ing activities to the F16 fault (Li et al. 2014). These instances  highlight  how  deep  mining  activities  can provoke fault slips, thus heightening the risk of cata- strophic events.   Coal  mining  operations  in  China  are  advancing to  greater  depths  annually  at  a  rate  of  8–25  m,  pos- ing increased risks of geological failures (Chen et al. 2019; Xie et al.2019). Specifically, mining near fault lines has been linked to sudden failures of coal seams and  surrounding  rock  strata,  often  resulting  in  cata- strophic roadway roof collapses due to intense strain energy  releases  (Li  et  al.  2007;  Foulger  et  al.  2018;   Wang  et  al.  2021;  Zhou  et  al.  2022).  As  of  the  end of  2022,  over  50  Chinese  coal  mines  have  exceeded depths  of  1000  m,  with  the  deepest  extending  to 1510 m (Kang et al. 2023).   In  applied  elasticity,  faults  can  be  treated  as  spe- cial boundary conditions. For mining operations near faults,  the  interaction  process  can  be  distinctly  cat- egorized  into  two  parts:  the  mining-induced  faulting process,  which  can  trigger  induced  earthquakes,  and the  subsequent  impact  of  these  earthquakes  on  min- ing  activities.  This  dual  interaction  underscores  the complex dynamics at play between mining operations and  fault  reactivation.  Insights  into  the  mechanisms of  fault  reactivation  and  the  resulting  coal  or  rock bursts have been extensively explored through a com- bination of in-situ observations, theoretical analyses, numerical modeling, and experimental investigations (Li  et  al.  2024a,  2024b;  Shan  et  al.  2023;  Song  and Liang  2021;  Wu  et  al.  2021).  Investigating  mining- induced  fault  coseismic  slip  is  essential  for  under- standing  the  physical  processes  and  mechanisms  of mining-induced earthquakes and exploring the impact of stress disturbance on fault stability (Dong and Luo 2022; Li 2024a, 2024b, 2025). Given that the faulting caused by deep mining may lead to rock (coal) bursts, considerable  research  has  been  conducted  to  under- stand  the  mechanisms  underlying  mining-induced fault slip (Dong et al. 2023; Wei et al. 2020).   While  reservoir  studies  have  extensively  docu- mented the impact of reduced pore pressure on lower- ing  effective  normal  stress,  such  considerations  have yet  to  be  thoroughly  explored  in  the  context  of  coal mining.  Decreases  in  effective  normal  stress,  signifi- cant  due  to  their  potential  to  trigger  earthquakes,  are a  common  result  of  reservoir  depletion  (Buijze  et  al. 2019; Ji et al. 2022; Rudnicki 2022). In contrast, previ- ous research on the faulting processes in deep coal min- ing  has  mainly  emphasized  the  concentration  of  shear stress,  with  less  attention  given  to  changes  in  normal stress  (Song  and  Liang  2021;  Jiao  et  al.  2021;  Zhang et  al.  2023;  Zhu  et  al.  2021).  Our  research  challenges this  perspective  by  demonstrating  that  reductions  in normal stress on a fault also significantly contribute to fault  instability.  This  insight  is  grounded  in  the  appli- cation  of  the  3-D  Mohr–Coulomb  criterion,  which assesses the fault stress ratio—the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on the fault—against the fault frictional strength (μs). Adhering to the Wallace-Bott hypothesis, we assume that the direction of slip aligns with that of   the  maximum  stress  (Bott  1959;  Wallace  1951).  Rec- ognizing  that  mining  activities  modify  both  shear  and normal  stresses  on  the  fault  underscores  the  impor- tance of evaluating the stress ratio, in addition to shear stress,  in  scenarios  of  mining-induced  earthquakes.  In mining-induced  fault-slip  scenarios,  previous  studies primarily utilized a basic static-dynamic friction model which  overlooked  the  role  of  the  critical  slip  distance in  shaping  fault  slip  (Hoffmann  et  al.  2013;  Hofmann and Scheepers 2011). Subsequent research has demon- strated that the critical slip distance significantly affects fault  slip  dynamics,  particularly  in  sublevel  stopping mining  scenarios  (Sainoki  and  Mitri  2014, 2015;  Sai- noki et al. 2019; Yan et al. 2023, 2024a). Consequently, this paper adopts a linear slip weakening law  to com- prehensively evaluate how critical slip distance impacts the  characteristics  of  fault  coseismic  slip  as  mining approaches the fault.   Deep  mining  operations  have  the  potential  to  reac- tivate  faults,  initiating  processes  such  as  fault  failure and coseismic slip. Notably, the magnitude of mining- induced earthquakes is more strongly influenced by the extent of coseismic slip than by stress alone, underscor- ing the necessity of a comprehensive investigation into both  fault  failure  and  slip  dynamics.  This  study  aims to systematically explore fault instability through three integrated models:   Virtual  fault  model  (VF):  This  model  establishes  a foundational  understanding  of  mining-induced  stress disturbances  by  evaluating  the  fault  stress  ratio  under the assumption of infinite fault frictional strength.   3-D  Mohr–Coulomb  criterion  model  (MC):  By incorporating  a  static  friction  coefficient,  this  model enables an in-depth analysis of coseismic slip distribu- tion, considering variables such as mining distance and frictional properties.   Slip weakening model (SW): The final model adopts a slip weakening law to provide a nuanced analysis of the faulting processes directly induced by mining activ- ities. Our study specifically focuses on the Yuejin coal mine in China, investigating how mining close to a fault can cause fault failure and coseismic slip.   2   3‑D numerical modeling procedures   for simulating coseismic slip in deep mining   2.1   Detailed model framework: overview, parameters, equations, and assumptions   We  developed  a  3-D  model  using  a  rectangular  vol- ume illustrated in Fig. 1. This model spans a length of 2400  m  in  the  mining  direction  (x-direction),  with  a width of 1200 m (y-direction) and a vertical height of 1200 m (z-direction). The origin of the model is posi- tioned at the lower left corner, and the vertical direc- tion is defined as upward. The depth variable, denoted by ℎ, is calculated by h = 1600 − z, varying from 400 to 1600 m across the model. For our analysis of static equilibrium, we employed the following key govern- ing equation: ∇ ∙ 𝛔 + F = 0   The  relationship  between  the  strain  vector  ε  and   displacement vector u is   where σ is the total stress tensor, and F represents the body forces, including gravity.   It is commonly assumed that when all stress com- ponents  are  null,  the  corresponding  elastic  strain should also be zero. We have established the follow- ing displacement boundary conditions:   ux(0, y, z) = 0 uy(x, 0, z) = 0 uz(x, y, 0) = 0   ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ where  ui  is  i-component  displacement,  and  i  takes ⎩ either x, y, or z.   Next,  we  set   the  following  stress  boundary   conditions,   𝜎H 0 0 0 𝜎h 0 0 0 𝜎v ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦   ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ Here,  we  define  σh,  σH,  and  σv  as  the  smallest ⎩ horizontal,  largest  horizontal,  and  vertical  far-field principal stresses, respectively. Additionally, ρ rep- resents  density  and  g  is  gravitational  acceleration. We  assign  a  positive  value  to  compressive  stress. The  background  stress  ratios  are  represented  by  rh and  rH.  This  notation  framework  ensures  that  the stress  orientations  and  characteristics  are  clearly understood,  facilitating  accurate  analysis  and  inter- pretation of our results.   In  the  3-D  context,  we  develop  a  3-D  model  to articulate the expressions for the shear (τ) and nor- mal  stress  (σn)  on  any  given  plane,  utilizing  basis vectors.  This  model  distinguishes  between  shear stress  components  along  the  strike  and  dip  direc- tions  of  the  fault  plane.  By  employing  a  rotation matrix  (R),  we  calculate  σn  and  τ  by  rotating  the fault  plane  orientation  within  a  stationary  coor- dinate  system,  with  these  shear  stress  components depicted in Fig. 1b.   Furthermore, we define the fault stress ratio k as the  ratio  of  maximum  shear  stress  to  normal  stress on the fault plane,   In  this  definition,   1 + 𝜏2 𝜏2 2   represents  the  maxi- mum shear stress on the fault, where τ1 and τ2 repre- sent  shear  stresses  along  the  fault  dip  and  strike, respectively.  The  parameter  k  plays  a  pivotal  role  in governing fault stability and serves as a key metric in analyzing coseismic slip activity (Morris et al. 1996). By  monitoring  and  applying  k,  fault  management strategies  can  be  effectively  informed,  including adjusting mining distances, optimizing panel layouts, and  implementing  stress  relief  measures  to  mitigate the  risks  of  fault  reactivation  and  seismic  hazards. Integrating k into operational decision-making trans- forms it into a powerful tool for improving safety and ensuring stability in deep mining environments.   We  employed  the  3-D  Mohr–Coulomb  criterion   to assess fault failure, as shown in Eq. (7)   √ where  τ  is 2   as  shown  in  Eq.  (7),  σn  is  the normal  stress  applied  on  the  fault,  interact  with  the friction  coefficient  (μs),  under  conditions  where  the cohesion  (C)  is  assumed  to  be  zero.  Consistent  with the  Wallace-Bott  hypothesis,  we  assume  that  the direction  of  slip  aligns  with  that  of  the  maximum stress  (Bott  1959;  Wallace  1951).  This  setup  allows us to examine the stability of the reverse fault under mining-induced  stress  disturbances  by  comparing  k with the friction coefficient.   We  integrated  the  slip  weakening  law  (Fig.  1c) to evaluate how mining-induced stress disturbances influence coseismic slip.   where  μs  is  the  static  friction  coefficient,  μd  is  the dynamic friction coefficient, d is the slip distance, and Dc is the critical slip distance.   Equations  (6–8)  are  crucial  in  understanding the  evolution  of  fault  stability  and  slip  behavior under  dynamically  changing  geological  conditions induced  by  mining  activities.  This  comprehensive approach  not  only  enhances  our  understanding  of fault  mechanics  but  also  contributes  to  safer  min- ing practices by predicting potential seismic events more accurately.   We  have  uniformly  set  the  elastic  parameters, which  are  detailed  in  Table  1.  This  standardization ensures consistency across all simulations, facilitating reliable  comparisons  and  analyses.  We  examine  the spatial  relationship  between  k,  the  mining  distance (Dm),  and  the  fault  dip  angle  (φ)  within  the  context of a specifically defined local coordinate system. Dm measures  the  separation  between  the  fault  and  the mining  face,  is  assigned  positive  values  when  the mining face is on the hanging wall side and negative values  when  on  the  footwall  side.  We  established  a local  coordinate  system  with  Ls  and  Ld  representing the fault strike direction and the fault dip direction, as depicted in Fig. 1a, respectively. In this model, posi- tive  Ld  indicate  an  upward  direction,  while  negative values denote a downward direction.   2.2   Employing PyLith: open-source software for   numerical simulations   In this study, we utilized PyLith version 4.0.0 (https:// pylith. readt hedocs. io/ en/ latest/), a finite element soft- ware acclaimed for its ability to model crustal defor- mations over a diverse scale—from meters up to hun- dreds  of  kilometers.  PyLith  is  particularly  noted  for its  adept  handling  of  both  quasi-static  and  dynamic earthquake  fault  simulations.  The  software’s  reli- ability and robustness have been thoroughly validated by  Aagaard  et  al.  (2013,  2023)  and  endorsed  by  the Southern  California  Earthquake  Center  (SCEC)  for its precision in earthquake modeling.   Further  advancing  our  research,  we  upgraded  to PyLith  version  4.0.0  to  meticulously  simulate  spa- tial  variations  in  mining-induced  coseismic  slip.  For mesh generation, we employed Gmsh as the pre-pro- cessor to construct a detailed mesh model. This model contains  between  6,693,848  and  12,797,868  tetrahe- dron  elements,  with  nodes  positioned  at  each  vertex   and element dimensions along the fault maintained at 2  m,  as  detailed  in  Table  2.  This  rigorous  approach in  modeling  ensures  a  high  level  of  accuracy  in  our simulations, capturing the intricate dynamics of fault interaction under mining stress conditions.   3   Analysis of mining‑induced fault failure   and coseismic slip   3.1   Evaluation spatial disturbance of stress and k on   Our  approach  began  by  measuring  the  stress  dis- turbances  caused  by  mining  activities,  under  the assumption  that  the  fault  shear  strength  was  infi- nite.  This  initial  assumption  allowed  us  to  isolate the  effects  of  mining  alone  on  the  stress  state  with- out complications from fault strength limitations. We then  proceeded  to  assess  how  these  mining-induced stresses  distributed  along  the  fault,  examining  their   relationship  with  the  Dm  and  φ.  This  analysis  helps to elucidate the extent to which mining activities can influence  fault  stability  by  altering  stress  conditions along the fault plane.   3.1.1   Mining-induced stress and k perturbations   along the fault   We explored the relationship between mining activ- ities  and  the  resulting  stress  alterations  within  the VF  zone,  quantifying  the  stability  of  the  fault  in response to mining. In Fig. 2, we assessed the vari- ations in shear and normal stresses across the fault plane,  with  Dm = − 60  m  and  φ = 30°.  Figure  2a   showed  that  the  maximum  shear  stress  reached approximately  19  MPa  at  the  fault.  Notably,  at the  mining  level  (where  Ld = 60  m),  shear  stress decreases  significantly  to  around  1  MPa,  indicat- ing  a  localized  shear  stress  release  due  to  mining. This  pattern  suggests  that  mining-induced  shear stress  perturbations  are  predominantly located above  the  mining  level  when  footwall  mining  is employed.  Conversely,  in  Fig.  2b,  the  maximum normal  stress  was  observed  to  be  around  42  MPa at  a  specific  point  (Ls = 600  m,  Ld = 40  m).  Areas experiencing  increased  shear  stress  generally  cor- responded  with  regions  of  reduced  normal  stress, highlighting  a  critical  interaction  between  these   stress  components.  The  zones  of  increased  normal stress  were  primarily  below  Ld = 100  m,  illustrat- ing  how  mining  activities  alter  stress  distributions vertically along the fault. Supplemental Fig. S1 fur- ther  investigates  k,  which  serves  as  an  indicator  of fault  stability  under  mining-induced  stresses.  Here, k varied from 0.05 at Ld = 60 m to a peak of 1.45 at Ld = 145 m (Fig. S1c). This variation underlines the   significant impact of position relative to the fault on the  fault’s  stability.  By  integrating  the  visual  and quantitative analyses from Figs. 2 and S1, we have established  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  how mining-induced  stress  perturbations  influence  both the shear and normal stress landscapes along a fault. The  parameter  k  emerges  as  a  crucial  metric  for assessing  fault  stability,  particularly  in  the  context of mining near fault zones.   3.1.2   The influence of φ on stress, k, and strain   Zone  3  (Pink  zone):  A  decrease  in  fault  stability   energy density   Our  investigations  into  how  φ  impacts  the  stress, stress  ratio,  and  strain  energy  density  (Estrain)  are detailed in Figs. 3 and 4. Figure 3 displays the vari- ations  in  normal  and  shear  stress,  along  with  Estrain, as φ changes from 20° to 80° at 10° intervals. Nota- bly,  both  maximum  and  minimum  normal  stresses increase with φ, with higher values observed in hang- ing wall mining scenarios compared to footwall min- ing (Fig. 3a and d). Conversely, the patterns in shear stress differ; minimum shear stress increases from 20° to 60° and then declines beyond 60° (Fig. 3b), while maximum  shear  stress  peaks  at  40°  before  decreas- ing (Fig. 3e). Estrain, represented in Fig. 3c and f, also shows that values on the hanging wall side are gener- ally higher than those on the footwall side, highlight- ing an asymmetric impact of mining activities based on fault orientation.   Figure 4a illustrates the significant variability of k with  changes  in  φ.  As  φ  increases  from  20°  to  80°, the  range  of  k  values  shifts  dramatically,  indicat- ing  that  lower  φ  values  can  induce  higher  k  values, thereby  enhancing  the  potential  for  fault  instability and earthquake induction. This figure categorizes the mining site into three zones based on k-distribution:   Zone 1 (Blue zone): No significant mining-induced   stress disturbance.   Zone 2 (Shallow green zone): An increase in fault   stability due to a decrease in mining-induced k.   driven by mining operations.   Figure  4b  further  quantifies  this  trend,  show- ing a gradual decrease in kmax from 2.83 to 0.4 as φ increases  from  20°  to  80°.  These  findings  underline the critical influence of φ on fault stability, suggesting that proactive fault instability analysis is crucial, par- ticularly near faults with smaller dip angles.   3.1.3   Correlation between Dm and k   This  analysis  explores  the  dynamic  relationship between  k  and  the  proximity  of  mining  activities  to fault,  with  specific  attention  given  to  how  Dm  influ- ence  fault  stability.  Figure  5  illustrates  the  changes in  k  as  mining  operations  approach  the  fault,  using parameters of φ = 30°.   Figure 5a provided a detailed graphical representa- tion of the distribution of k along the fault as a func- tion  of  Dm,  with  color  variations  denoting  different distances.  As  mining  progresses  closer  to  the  fault, we observe distinct trends in k values: kmax increases as  the  working  face  nears  the  fault.  Specifically,  at Dm = 100  m,  kmax  reaches  1.1  at  Ld = − 220  m  and escalates to 1.7 at Ld = − 100 m when Dm = 0 m. This upward  trend  in  kmax  suggests  an  escalating  risk  of fault reactivation as mining encroaches upon the fault. In  contrast  to  kmax,  kmin  exhibits  a  gradual  decrease with  the  mining  approach,  indicating  a  stabilizing effect  at  certain  segments  along  the  fault.  Figure  5b quantifies  these  observations,  showing  how  kmax,   and  kmin  adjust  with  varied  Dm.  The  plotting  reveals a  clear  correlation:  as  Dm  decreases,  kmax  increases, signifying  a  potential  increase  in  fault  instability  in specific areas close to the mining activities.   3.2   Coseismic fault slip under MC   3.2.1   Comparative analysis of shear stress   redistribution and normal stress consistency under mining-induced conditions   Following  an  initial  analysis  with  an  infinite  μs  fault model  (VF),  we  conducted  further  studies  using MC,  introducing  contact  interfaces  on  the  fault  to   better  capture  the  real-world  dynamics.  We  specifi- cally evaluated the stress and slip under the condition of φ = 30° to understand the redistribution of stresses due to mining activities.   In our detailed examination of the changes in shear stress  distribution  influenced  by  mining  operations near fault zones, significant differences were observed between Figs. 6a and 2a. Specifically, Fig. 2a displays a maximum shear stress of 19 MPa, which is higher compared  to  the  16.5  MPa  noted  in  Fig.  6a.  This reduction  in  maximum  shear  stress  in  Fig.  6a,  along with  the  higher  minimum  value  of  approximately 1.0 MPa from Fig. 2a, can be attributed to the influ- ence of the fault’s friction coefficient (μs = 0.6). This   coefficient  facilitated  a  redistribution  of  shear  stress during  fault  slip,  leading  to  a  decreased  bearing  of shear stress in regions closer to mining activities.   Moreover, the slip zone in Fig. 6b aligns with the scenarios modeled with k = μs = 0.6 as shown in Fig. S2, demonstrating consistency in the behavior of slip- stress  ratio  under  varied  conditions.  Further  investi- gation into the normal stress behavior as depicted in Fig. S3 reveals no significant change compared to the VF model shown in Fig. 2b. This stability in normal stress  across  different  models  and  conditions  sup- ports the robustness of the 3-D Mohr–Coulomb crite- rion, as documented in recent studies by Aghighi and Asgari (2020), Aochi and Tsuda (2023), and Hou and Yang (2022).   increased disturbance in the surrounding rock mass and  a  greater  risk  of  rockburst.  From  the  perspec- tive  of  minimizing  the  risk  of  inducing  seismic events,  this  study  recommends  prioritizing  hang- ing  wall  mining.  This  strategy  takes  into  account the  observed  asymmetry,  where  footwall  mining  is associated with higher seismic risks, making hang- ing wall mining a safer initial approach in deep min- ing operations. By correlating Dm, μs, and coseismic slip,  the  insights  garnered  from  Fig.  7  are  pivotal for  understanding  the  interactions  between  mining operations  and  fault  stability,  providing  a  founda- tion for safer mining practices and better risk man- agement in seismically active regions.   3.2.2   Influence of Dm and fault friction coefficients   3.2.3   Normal stress release and its impact on fault   on coseismic slip in hanging wall and footwall mining   instability and slip   We  further  explores  the  qualitative  aspects  of  fault slip by focusing on maximum slip and slip length, as presented  in  Fig.  7.  This  figure  highlights  variations in  coseismic  slip  under  different  mining  scenarios, illustrating the significant effects of Dm and μs on slip behaviors.   Figure 7a details the maximum slip across various mining  conditions,  showing  a  noticeable  increase  in slip  as  mining  operations  approach  the  fault,  espe- cially  under  smaller  μs.  This  increase  indicates  a heightened  fault  instability,  which  varies  footwall mining,  compared  to  hanging  wall  mining  at  the same  absolute  mining  distance  (|Dm|),  resulting  in a  larger  maximum  slip,  suggesting  an  asymmetric response  based  on  the  mining  side  relative  to  the fault.  Figure  7b  quantifies  the  lengths  of  slip  zones, demonstrating that these zones expand or contract in response to Dm and μs. A notable trend is that larger μs values correlate with shorter slip zones, and zones near the fault are larger, indicating that the proximity to the fault enhances slip zone extensions.   The  analysis  reveals  that  slip  zone  lengths  are generally  larger  in  footwall  mining  than  in  hang- ing wall mining, emphasizing the influence of min- ing  location  on  seismic  risk.  Our  findings  further corroborate  the  results  of  Kong  et  al.  (2023),  who demonstrated  that  mining  through  a  fault  from  the footwall  side  results  in  a  higher  seismic  moment compared  to  the  hanging  wall  side,  leading  to   The  release  of  normal  stress  in  deep  coal  mining is  a  critical  factor  that  can  precipitate  fault  insta- bility  and  subsequent  slip.  Figure  8  details  these dynamics  under  the  mining  conditions  Dm = − 60 m, Wm = 600 m, and μs = 0.6, capturing the interplay between  normal  stress  changes  and  fault  slip.  Fig- ure 8a and Fig. 8b represent the 2-D distribution of fault slip and normal stress, respectively. These dia- grams  effectively  highlight  the  significant  decrease in  normal  stress  across  the  fault  plane,  notably within the pink zone identified as the normal stress release zone. This reduction is crucial, indicating a localized weakening of the fault plane, which could potentially  increase  the  likelihood  of  fault  slip. Figure  8c  further  elucidates  this  phenomenon  by presenting  normal  stress  curves  at  Ls = 600  m  and Ld = 135  m,  situated  within  the  broader  context  of Fig. 8b. These curves reveal a pronounced reduction in  normal  stress  from  an  initial  peak  of  approxi- mately  47  MPa  down  to  as  low  as  7  MPa.  This dramatic  drop  underscores  the  significant  impact of  mining  activities  on  stress  alteration,  thereby enhancing the potential for fault activation and slip in these regions.   Figure 8 captures the complex relationship between mining-induced  stress  modifications  and  faulting behaviors.  The  observed  decrease  in  normal  stress not only creates conditions favorable for fault slip but also heightens the risk of seismic events, especially in areas where stress release is most intense.   3.3   Coseismic fault slip under SW   In  an  effort  to  understand  the  mechanics  of  coseis- mic slip under different conditions, Fig. 9 presents a   detailed  exploration  of  k  as  a  function  of  slip,  com- paring  the  outcomes  under  the  Mohr–Coulomb  cri- terion  and  the  slip  weakening  law.  This  figure  high- lights how different fault mechanics models influence   between  slip  progression  and  stress  ratio  increase under  the  Mohr–Coulomb  criterion.  Figure  9b  focus to  the  slip  weakening  law,  incorporating  a  dynamic setting with μs = 0.7, μd = 0.6, and Dc = 0.02 m. Unlike MC,  the  SW  reveals  a  more  complex  interaction where k initially increases but then shows a tendency to plateau as the slip continues to extend. This pattern suggests  that  the  weakening  effects,  dictated  by  the transition from static to dynamic friction coefficients, play a significant role in moderating the stress ratio as the fault slip evolves.   Figure  10  presents  a  compelling  examination  of how variations in Dc and μd affect coseismic slip, pro- viding  insights  into  the  behavior  of  mining  induced coseismic  slip.  This  figure  consists  of  two  panels that detail the dependence of slip outcomes on these parameters,  illustrating  the  mechanics  of  faulting  in the context of the slip weakening law.   Figure 10a focuses on the relationship between Dc and coseismic slip characteristics such as slip length and  maximum  slip.  The  graph  clearly  demonstrates that  as  Dc  increases,  both  the  length  and  the  ampli- tude  of  slip  experience  substantial  variations.  The trend  indicates  that  smaller  Dc  values  correspond  to longer and more extensive slips. This panel illustrates slip  lengths  ranging  from  120  m  to  over  180  m  and maximum  slip  magnitudes  escalating  progressively   slip behavior under identical mining conditions (Dm = − 60 m).   Figure  9a  illustrate  k  under  the  Mohr–Coulomb criterion,  where  μs  is  set  at  0.7.  This  graph  shows how  k  varies  with  increasing  slip.  The  progression indicates a relatively consistent increase in k with slip distance,  underscoring  a  straightforward  relationship   with  Dc,  from  20  to  50  mm,  before  stabilizing.  Fig- ure 10b explores how varying μd, from 0.60 to 0.70, influences  the  slip  under  a  constant  Dc  of  6  cm.  It depicts  a  linear  increase  in  both  maximum  slip  and slip length as μd increases, highlighting the sensitivity of fault slip to changes in the dynamic friction prop- erties  of  the  fault.  Maximum  slip  values  range  from 17.5 mm to 28.5 mm, while slip lengths adjust mini- mally, indicating a direct relationship between μd and the slip intensity rather than its spatial distribution.   4   Discussions   4.1   The critical role of k in fault stability and slip analysis: integration with the Mohr–Coulomb criterion and slip weakening law   In  our  study,  the  fault  stress  ratio  k  serves  as  a  piv- otal parameter in assessing fault stability and analyz- ing slip behavior. Defined as the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on the fault plane, k is deeply rooted in  the  Mohr–Coulomb  failure  criterion.  Accord- ing  to  this  criterion,  a  fault  is  expected  to  slip  when the shear stress τ exceeds the critical value given by τ = μσn,  where  μ  is  the  friction  coefficient  represent- ing the fault resistance to sliding.   Under  the  Mohr–Coulomb  criterion,  k  is  a  key measure of fault stability: When k < μ, the shear stress   is  below  the  fault  frictional  resistance,  indicating stability.  When  k ≥ μ,  the  shear  stress  surpasses  the fault  frictional  resistance,  leading  to  fault  reactiva- tion and potential slip. This comparison is crucial for determining the likelihood of fault slip under specific stress conditions, making k not only a vital indicator of fault stability but also a reliable predictor of fault slip.   The  slip  weakening  law  further  refines  the  analy- sis by introducing the dynamic evolution of the fric- tion  coefficient  during  slip,  where  μ  decreases  from a  static  value  μs  to  a  lower  dynamic  value  μd.  This reduction  in  friction  reflects  the  weakening  behavior of the fault as slip progresses. k is first compared with the μs to determine the onset of slip. As slip continues and the fault weakens, k is then compared with μd. If k remains higher than μd, slip will continue until the stress  is  redistributed  or  the  fault  stabilizes  (Fig.  9). This framework allows for a more precise prediction of fault behavior under dynamic stress conditions.   To  validate  the  reliability  of  the  k,  we  conducted detailed comparisons between our model outputs and theoretical analyses. Our study confirms that regions where  k = μ = 0.6  in  Fig.  S2  correspond  closely  with the  slip  regions  depicted  in  Fig.  6b.  This  alignment supports  the  use  of  k  as  a  reliable  predictor  of  fault slip  and  verifies  the  accuracy  of  k  in  modeling  fault stability.  The  distribution  of  k  across  the  fault  plane also  allows  us  to  identify  stable  regions  where  slip   is absent. These areas, where k is significantly lower than  μ,  indicate  increased  stability.  For  example,  in the vicinity of Ls = 600 m and Ld = 50 m, k is approxi- mately  0.2,  suggesting  stability  despite  the  presence of mining disturbances.   By  mapping  the  distribution  of  k,  we  gain  deeper insights  into  the  impact  of  mining  activities  on  fault stability. While mining can induce fault slip and cre- ate zones of instability, our analysis reveals that cer- tain areas may actually become more stable, as indi- cated  by  lower  k  values.  This  dual  effect  highlights the complex influence of mining on fault stability and underscores the importance of evaluating k across the entire fault plane.   4.2   Verification of numerical simulations through   Zone 1—the characteristic influence of rH and φ on the k   We  conducted  a  theoretical  analysis  to  understand how  rH  and  φ  influence  the  distribution  of  k  within a  reverse  fault  environment.  This  analysis  adjusted the  background  stress  to  align  with  the  fault  coordi- nate system, providing foundational insights into the effects of rH and φ on k. Figure 11a shows that with an  increase  in  rH,  there  is  a  corresponding  rise  in  k, indicating  a  direct  relationship  between  rH  and  the stress  ratio  along  the  fault.  Figure  11b  shows  k  as  a function  of  φ,  when  rH  is  constant,  an  increase  in  φ leads to a higher k value. In contrast, when φ exceeds the  critical  angle,  further  increases  in  φ  result  in  a   reduction  in  k.  This  pattern  suggests  that  smaller  φ values, under consistent background stresses, tend to produce higher k values, which may amplify the risk of mining-induced seismic events.   The  regions  unaffected  by  mining  activities,  such as  Zone  1  depicted  in  Fig.  4a.  Here,  we  attribute  k primarily to the background stresses, rather than dis- turbances  caused  by  mining  operations.  This  obser- vation  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  validate  the precision  of  our  numerical  simulations  against  theo- retical  expectations.  This  verification  process  dis- plays  the  distribution  of  k  as  a  function  of  φ  across a  range  from  20°  to  70°  at  10°  intervals.  Figure  12   meticulously  contrasts  the  theoretical  solutions  with numerical  results  obtained  at  different  background stress  ratios  (rH = 3.0  and  rH = 2.0),  highlighting  the close alignment between these sets of data. Theoreti- cal  lines  representing  calculated  stress  ratios  overlap significantly  with  points  derived  from  our  simula- tions,  confirming  the  reliability  of  our  numerical methods.  This  correspondence  between  the  theo- retical  predictions  and  numerical  outcomes  not  only underscores the accuracy of our computational mod- els  but  also  reinforces  our  confidence  in  the  simula- tion  to  realistically  represent  fault  behaviors  under different stress conditions.   4.3   Verification of numerical simulations through   slip and stress drop analysis   Stress  drop,  defined  as  the  reduction  in  shear  stress across  a  fault  from  before  to  after  an  earthquake, plays a pivotal role in the dynamics of seismic energy release  (Kanamori  and  Anderson  1975a,  b;  Mayeda and Walter 1996; Sato 1972; Xiang and Yang 2020). Stress  drop  provides  a  measure  of  the  energy  mag- nitude  involved  in  seismic  events,  serving  as  a  key indicator in earthquake studies (Yamada et al. 2021). Fukuyama  and  Madariaga  (1995)  advanced  our understanding by deriving a relationship between slip and stress drop, integrating their findings into a new boundary  integral  equation  model  for  dynamic  ten- sile  and  shear  cracks.  Their  work  demonstrated  that the  final  stress  drop  is  consistent  for  both  static  and dynamic scenarios, illustrating that the stress release mechanism remains uniform across different types of seismic ruptures.   This study, rooted in the principles of linear elas- tostatic  theory,  provides  a  precise  elucidation  of  the relationship between fault slip distribution and static stress  drop.  The  foundational  models  established  by Eshelby  (1957),  Kanamori  and  Anderson  (1975a), and  Parsons  et  al.  (1988)  have  established  founda- tional  models  where  the  static  stress  drop,  denoted as  Δτ,  is  directly  proportional  to  the  average  slip  D observed on the fault. This proportionality forms the basis for understanding the mechanics of fault move- ments and the stress adjustments resulting from seis- mic activities.   In  these  models,  the  general  formula  describing this  relationship  is  commonly  expressed  through  a   constant  R, drop Δτ to the average slip D as follows: ( Δ𝜏 = 𝜆 ⋅ G ⋅ D Lc   ,  that  links  the  static  stress )   where  λ  represents  the  proportionality  factor  con- nected to the fault system’s stiffness, and the charac- teristic  dimension  of  the  fault,  Lc,  is  determined  by the  fault  specific  geometry.  Additionally,  the  shear modulus  (G),  which  indicates  the  rigidity  of  the geological  material,  is  set  at  6.5  GPa,  as  shown  in Table 1.   In Fig. 13a–c, under the condition of Wm = 400 m and  μs = 0.6,  the  mining-induced  stress  drop  ranged from − 10 MPa to 12 MPa. We further calculate the average  stress  drop  (Δτ),  and  the  average  slip  (D), and  we  summarize  all  the  data  together  as  shown  in Fig. 13d and Table 3, it shown that the large D caused a larger Δτ with a constant ratio R = 29 MPa*m−1.   To  validate  the  stress  drop  calculations  from PyLith,  we  compared  them  with  results  from  DC3D [51],  which  models  fault  slip  and  strain  distribution. DC3D  provided  us  with  a  theoretical  representation of  fault  slip  and  strain  distribution  around  the  fault formulated  by  Okada  (1985,  1992).  We  used  a  sub- routine  from  DC3D  (https:// www. bosai. go. jp/e/ dc3d. html)  to  calculate  displacement  and  spatial  deriva- tives at any point within an elastic half-space medium based on a uniform slip on a finite rectangular fault. For more detailed information, please refer to text S1. Since  mining-induced  fault  slips  are  not  uniform, we modeled the slip distribution as piecewise constant segments of 12 m each. We summed the stress changes from these segments to compute the overall stress drop distribution. In Fig. 14, the bars at the bottom represent the slip distribution used as input for DC3D. The stress drop distributions are shown as red solid circles for dif- ferent mining widths (Wm = 200 m, 300 m, and 400 m) with a friction coefficient (μs) of 0.6, alongside PyLith results depicted as blue open circles. These results con- firm consistency between the two methods.   4.4   Influence of mining location on asymmetric slip   response in reverse faults   The asymmetric slip response observed in Fig. 7 is closely  related  to  the  position  of  mining  activities   4.4.1   Mathematical analysis of stress distribution   In  the  3-D  model,  a  reverse  fault  configuration  is adopted, where vertical stress is represented by gravita- tional stress. The global coordinate system x, y, and z is used to represent spatial positions, with depth denoted by h (Table 1). Assuming σH = 2, and φ = 30° in current model,  the  background  conditions  described  in  Eq.  5 yield  the  following  calculations  for  the  background 0), shear stress (τ0), and the stress ratio normal stress (σn (k0) under reverse fault conditions:   relative  to  the  fault,  particularly  when  consider- ing background stress as a function of depth in the 3-D  model.  This  section  systematically  analyzes this  phenomenon  and  provides  a  mathematical explanation.   𝜎0 n = 1.25𝜌gh 𝜏0 = 0.433𝜌gh k0 = 𝜏0∕𝜎0   Considering  the  additional  shear  (τm)  and  normal m) induced by mining, the stress distribu-   stresses (σn tion on the fault can be calculated as:   n + 𝜎m 𝜎n = 𝜎0 𝜏 = 𝜏0 + 𝜏m   Thus, the fault stress ratio k is expressed as:   4.4.2   Asymmetry in slip response   The  stress  distribution  described  by  the  3-D  model helps explain the asymmetric slip response observed in  Fig.  7:  When  mining  occurs  on  the  footwall  side of the fault, the mining-induced stress perturbations, m  are  more  likely  to  affect  areas  above  the τm  and  σn 0  and  τ0  are  lower  at  shal- mining  level.  Because  σn lower depths, k is higher, increasing the likelihood of slip. Conversely, when mining occurs on the hanging wall side, slip is more likely to occur below the min- 0 and τ0 ing level. This is because at greater depths, σn   increase, reducing k and creating a more stable envi- ronment, thus reducing the likelihood of slip.   The asymmetric slip response observed in Fig. 7 is a direct result of the interaction between background normal  stress  as  a  function  of  depth  and  mining- induced stress perturbations. Compared to the deeper regions  on  the  hanging  wall  side,  the  areas  near  the mining  level  on  the  footwall  side  are  more  prone  to slip, indicating that the location of mining relative to the fault significantly influences fault behavior.   4.5   Self-similar characteristics of fault slip induced   by deep mining activities   In  this  study,  we  try  to  investigate  the  relationship between  maximum  slip  and  slip  length  in  scenarios of  coal  mining-induced  faulting,  examining  whether these  parameters  conform  to  the  linear  relation- ships typically observed in natural fault settings. We methodically  varied  parameters  such  as  frictional properties  and  Dm  to  explore  mining-induced  fault slip phenomena.   Figure  15  illustrates  the  correlation  between  slip length  and  maximum  slip  under  various  tectonic conditions.  This  visualization  not  only  deepens  our   understanding of the faulting triggered by mining activ- ities but also reinforces the geological principle of self- similarity.  Our  data  demonstrate  that  mining-induced fault slips can span up to 100 m, maintaining statistical consistency across various spatial scales, corroborating findings from both laboratory experiments and natural faulting  studies,  including  those  by  Mayeda  and  Wal- ter  (1996),  Delaney  and  Pollard  (1981),  Wesnousky (2008),  and  Katsube  et  al.  (2017).  By  aligning  these observations  with  established  geological  models,  our findings  not  only  validate  the  patterns  observed  in natural settings but also offer insights into the potential impacts of mining operations on subsurface stability.   4.6   Application to the mining-induced earthquake in   the Yuejin coal mine   On  August  11,  2010,  a  2.7  magnitude  earthquake occurred at No. 25110 working face in the Yuejin coal mine,  China,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  16,  triggered  by  the reactivation  of  F16  reverse  fault  (Cao  et  al.  2023;  Du et al. 2022). This seismic event, simulated in our model as  mining-induced,  took  place  when  Dm  was  − 80  m (Li et al. 2018). By taking into account factors like coal seam  thickness,  mining  depth,  fault  dip  angle,  work- ing  face  location,  background  stress,  and  fault  friction parameters (Table 1), we developed a model replicating conditions similar to those at the Yuejin coal mine.   We  estimate  the  seismic  moment  (M0)  of  the  min- ing-induced  faulting.  M0  is  defined  as  follows  (Aki 1967; Kanamori and Anderson 1975b),   where G represents the shear modulus (Table 1), As is the slip area, and D is the average slip (Table 3). The unit of M0 is Nm.   We  then  calculate  the  moment  magnitude  (Mw) using  the  following  formula  (Hanks  and  Kanamori 1979):   It  should  be  noted  that  our  estimation  was  based on moment magnitudes. As in several previous stud- ies (Ristau et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2021), we can con- sider  that  moment  magnitude  and  local  magnitudes are  roughly  the  same  scale.  Our  numerical  simula- tions  predicted  Mw  between  2.5  and  2.8,  aligning with  expectations  for  mining-related  seismic  activi- ties of approximately magnitude 2.7. The simulations indicated  that  an  earthquake  was  triggered  at  Dm = − 90 m, closely matching the actual Dm at which the earthquake was recorded. However, it is important to note  that  these  predictions  carry  considerable  uncer- tainty,  particularly  regarding  fault  friction.  Despite these  uncertainties,  our  modeling  approach  and results offer insights into the distribution of coseismic slip  caused  by  mining  activities,  providing  essential data  for  refining  mining  designs  and  improving  the safety of mining operations.   4.7   Limitations   The  future  study  also  needs  to  discuss  the  influence of  fault  roughness  on  the  fault  friction  parameters and rupture preparation process (Barton and Choubey 1977; Fukuyama et al. 2018; Yamashita et al. 2018). Although  this  study  acknowledges  the  role  of  fault roughness,  the  detailed  distribution  and  impact  of coseismic slip on faults with varying roughness levels due  to  mining  remain  insufficiently  addressed.  Fault roughness plays a critical role in shaping the mechan- ical behavior of faults, particularly their slip dynam- ics  and  stability  (Cattania  and  Segall  2021;  Sainoki and  Mitri  2014;  Xu  et  al.  2023).  Investigating  how different  roughness  levels  affect  fault  coseismic  slip and stress distribution in mining contexts is an essen- tial area for future research.   In  addition,  other  factors,  such  as  geological  het- erogeneity, groundwater pressure, and fault geometry, may significantly impact coseismic slip behavior and warrant  further  investigation  (Galis  et  al.  2010;  Yan",

The  cationic  cetyltrimethylammonium  chloride  (CTAC)  and  the\nanionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactants were used. The study employs a conductometric\nmethodology  to  examine  the  interactions  between  the  insecticide  and  the  surfactant.  The  critical\nmicellar  concentration  (CMC)  and  degree  of  counterions  dissociation  (α)  of  the  surfactants  were\nobtained  at  varying  concentrations  (0  to  3  µM)  of  the  insecticide  phosalone  and  temperatures\nbetween 301.15 and 321.15 K. In all cases, both parameters (CMC and α) demonstrated a decline\nin  line  with  the  increase  in  insecticide  concentration  and  temperature.  The  thermodynamic\nparameters  were  calculated  using  the  CMC  versus  temperature  data.  A  positive  value  of  ΔH°\nindicates that the micellisation process is endothermic. The negative values of ΔG° as a function of\ninsecticide  concentration  and\nis\nthermodynamically favorable and that the insecticide solubilises in the micelle core.

The\nprogressive  decrease  in  CMC  values  as  a\nfunction  of  insecticide  concentrations  suggests\nthe  presence  of  an\ninteraction  between\nphosalone  and  surfactants.  This  phenomenon\nmay  be  attributed  to  the  solubilisation  of  the\nphosalone  insecticide  in  each  of  the  surfactants\nutilised.

The  variation  in\nsurfactant  CMC  as  a  function  of  phosalone\nconcentration is illustrated in Fig. 2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe  plot  of  the  curve  of  the  critical  micellar\nconcentration  as  a  function  of  the  concentration\nof phosalone (CMC = f ([PSL]) allows us to see a\nprogressive  decrease  in  the  CMC  for  increasing\nconcentrations  of  the  pesticide.  However,  this\ndecrease  is  more  significant  at  level  of  the\nanionic  surfactant  SDS  (Singh  et  al.  2024).  To\nproperly  explain  this  decrease  in  CMC  in  the\npresence  of  phosalone,  it  is  important  to  see  its\nchemical  structure.  Indeed,  this  molecule  of\nchemical\nformula  C12H15ClNO4PS2  with  a\nhydrophobic  part  comprising  the  benzene  ring\nand  polar  bonds  (C-Cl,  C=O,  P=O,  C-N)  shows\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthat it has a very high permanent dipole moment\n(Broniatowski  and  Latka  2008).  In  solution,  it\ndemonstrates  a  robust  capacity  to  interact  with\nthe  tails  of  surfactants.  It  should  be  noted,\nhowever,  that  the  non-polar  sections  of  the\nmolecule are also capable of interacting with the\npolar  heads  of  surfactants.  This  phenomenon\nallows  highly  hydrophobic  organic  compound  to\nmake\nfor  micellar\nsolubilisation (Sarr et al. 2022, Sarr et al. 2017).\nThe  existence  of  this  dipole  moment  shows  that\nsolubilisation  takes  place  at  the  water/micelle\ninterface.  Phosalone  increases  the  action  of\nCTAC  and  SDS  by  adsorbing  at  the  interface\nwhile  at  the  same  time  decreasing  the  surface\ntension of the micelles.

The\na  more\nSDS\npronounced  reduction  of  α,\nindicative  of  a\nsubstantial  solubilisation  of  phosalone  within  the\ncore  of  the  micelles.  This  is  attributable  to  an\nincrease  in  hydrophobic  attraction  forces,  which\nresults in a reduction of α at the CMC.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe  same  assay  was  conducted,  with  specific\nconductivity monitored as a function of surfactant\nconcentration  at  varying  temperatures  and  at  a\nfixed concentration of phosalone (2.5x10-7 M).

It was observed that the concentration\nin\nof  CMC  decreased  with  an\ntemperature.  This  results  in  the  dehydration  of\nthe  hydrophilic  component  (polar  heads)  of  the\nsurfactants,  which\nfavours  micellisation.\nMoreover, the interaction of water molecules with\nhydrophobic  groups  (linear  surfactant  chains)\nmay  facilitate  the  process  of  micellisation  by\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\nincrease\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nincreasing  the  solubility  of  the  pesticide  (Sarr  et\nal. 2022, Sarr et al. 2017).

These\nvalues  demonstrate  a  clear  decrease  with\nincreasing  temperature,  which  indicates  that  the\nsolubility\nincreases  with\nof\ntemperature.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nphosalone\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFurthermore,  the  ΔH°  values  are  positive  in  all\ncases  and  increase  with  temperature,  indicating\nthat  the  process  is  endothermic  and  that  water\nmolecules  near  the  hydrophobic  part  of  the\nsurfactants  are  undergoing  degradation.  This\ndemonstrates  that  heat  is  transferred  from  the\nsurrounding  environment  to  the  micellar  system,\nwhich  is  the  underlying  cause  of  the  observed\nincrease in the system's enthalpy. It is described\nas  an  energetically  ascending  process  (Sarr  et\nal. 2022, Sarr et al. 2017).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nCissé et al.; Asian J. Chem.

This  is  contingent  upon  the  enthalpy\nfactor (ΔH°) and entropy factor (TΔS°) exhibiting\na  positive  and  negative  variation,  respectively,\nwith |TΔS°| being greater than ΔH°.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nis  evidenced  by\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThis\nthe  positive  entropy\nvariation observed in our study,  which increases\nwith  temperature.

The fact that |TΔS°| is greater\nthan  ΔH0  indicates  that  the  association  reaction\nbetween  phosalone  and  surfactants  (SDS  and\nCTAC) is partially controlled by the entropy term.\nThis  demonstrates  that  the  rise  in  enthalpy\nduring  micellisation  is  counterbalanced  by  the\ngrowth\nthe  system.  This\nexpansion  in  entropy  may  be  attributed  to  the\naggregation of the hydrophobic component of the\nmicelles,  as  well  as  the  release  of  counterions\n(Aguiar  2002).  A  representative  plot  of  ΔH0\nversus ΔS0 is illustrated in Fig. 5.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nin  disorder  within\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe  ∆H0  plot  according  to  ∆S0  shows  a  linear\ncurve,  thus  showing  a  compensation  between\nenthalpy  and  entropy.

The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  enhance  the  solubility  of  the  insecticide  phosalone  in  aqueous solution  through  micellisation.  The  cationic  cetyltrimethylammonium  chloride  (CTAC)  and  the anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactants were used. The study employs a conductometric methodology  to  examine  the  interactions  between  the  insecticide  and  the  surfactant.  The  critical micellar  concentration  (CMC)  and  degree  of  counterions  dissociation  (α)  of  the  surfactants  were obtained  at  varying  concentrations  (0  to  3  µM)  of  the  insecticide  phosalone  and  temperatures between 301.15 and 321.15 K. In all cases, both parameters (CMC and α) demonstrated a decline in  line  with  the  increase  in  insecticide  concentration  and  temperature.  The  thermodynamic parameters  were  calculated  using  the  CMC  versus  temperature  data.  A  positive  value  of  ΔH° indicates that the micellisation process is endothermic. The negative values of ΔG° as a function of insecticide  concentration  and is thermodynamically favorable and that the insecticide solubilises in the micelle core. The results of this  study  demonstrate  that  it  is  possible  to  solubilise  a  poorly  soluble  organic  molecule  by micellisation using conductivity alone, which is a valuable finding.   the  micellisation  process   temperature  demonstrate   To  meet  the  food  needs  of  a  growing  global population,  there  is  a  significant  opportunity  for world  agricultural  production increase, particularly in developing countries. It is therefore essential  to  enhance  agricultural  yields  and regulate  production  by  protecting  crops  from pests.  In  light  of  this  challenge,  the  deployment of  phytosanitary  products,  or  pesticides, represents an effective strategy for achieving this goal.   These products are designed to safeguard plants from  parasitic  fungi  (fungicides),  insect  pests (insecticides),  or  even to  eradicate  weeds (herbicides) (Varca 2012). However, the majority of  pesticides in  surface  water  and groundwater  are  not  particularly  soluble,  which presents a challenge in their analysis. Moreover, the solubility of pesticides in water often presents obstacles to the implementation of spectroscopic techniques,  such  as  UV  absorption  and fluorescence  (Bodian  et  al.  2022,  Sambou  et  al. 2021,  Saleck  et  al.  2019).  This  requires  the  use of  organic  solvents  or  other  supplementary reagents (Mendy et al. 2019).   Phosalone  inhibits  acetylcholine  activity,  but  its low  water  solubility  can  result  in  prolonged persistence environmental  matrices, particularly surface and groundwater (Altuntas et al.  2003).  The  insecticide  has  poor  solubility  in water (3.5 mg L-1) at 298.15 K. The low solubility of limited microbiological  and  photochemical  degradation in  environmental  matrices,  which  could  lead  to the  persistence  of  the  insecticide  in  surface  and groundwater (Daneshvar et al. 2004).   insecticide  may   result   Given  the  low  solubility  of  phosalone  insecticide in  water,  we  have  initiated  a  study  of  micellar solubilisation  with  the  objective  of  facilitating  the solubilisation  of  phosalone in  an  aqueous system.  This  will  be  achieved  by  forming  mixed micelles  with  surfactants  or  by  incorporating  the insecticide into the interior of micelles.   The  formation  of  micelles  is  dependent  on  the concentration  of  surfactants,  which  is  influenced by  the  interplay  of  hydrophilic  and  hydrophobic interactions  (Alam  et  al.  2021,  Aguiar  2002). Amphiphilic  molecules,  such  as  surfactants,  are effective  at  solubilising  feebly  soluble  organic entities  due inherent  self-assembly their properties (Alam et al. 2021, Aguiar 2002).   With  this  in  mind,  we  undertook  a  study  of  the use of phosalone in the Niayes agricultural zone of 2-  oxo-1,3-benzoxazol-3(2H)-yl)methyl]  O,O- diethylphosphorodithioate) is a organophosphate insecticide used to control a wide range of pests on certain crops, including grapes, apples, peas, potatoes,  rice,  and  cotton  (Majlesi  et  al.  2016, Aqa Sadat et al. 2020).   The  micellisation  process  in  surfactants  is  a thermodynamic phenomenon that can be studied including using  a  variety  of isothermal  calorimetry,  surface tension,  UV- visible,  fluorimetry  and  conductometry  (Banjare et al. 2020, Scholz et al. 2018). In this study, we employ the  more  straightforward  and  cost- effective  conductometry  technique  to  enhance   techniques,   the  solubility  of  the  insecticide  phosalone  in anionic  and  cationic  aqueous  micellar  media (Sarr et al. 2022, Sarr et al. 2017).   The phosalone solution was prepared in distilled water at a pH = 7, with a concentration of 10-3 M. The stock solutions of the  SDS and CTAC  were prepared  at  a  concentration  of  0.1  M  in  distilled water.  All  solutions  were  stored  in  glass  vials. The  latter  were  then  placed  in  a  refrigerator, protected light.  The  physicochemical properties of phosalone are presented in Table 1 (Suntio et al. 1988, Khan et al. 2016, Rahim et al. 2021).   Fig. 1. Chemical structure of phosalone   of  measured   This  analytical  study  was  conducted  using  a 3100L VWR® Conductivity/TDS/°C  Meter,  Bench,  which  was accompanied  by  a  measuring  cell  and  a temperature  sensor.  Conductivity  Accuracy value,  Conductivity ±0.5% Resolution  Up  to  0.001  µS/cm  (depending  on probe). The device was calibrated with a 0.01 M KCl solution  exhibiting conductivities  of 1278 μS cm-1 and 1413 μS cm-1 at temperatures of 293.15 and 298.15 K, respectively, using the appropriate standard curve. A VELP SCIENTIFICA magnetic stirrer  (Healing  Magnetic  Stirrer)  was  utilized  to the  stock facilitate operations  were solutions.  All  weighing conducted  using  a  Sartorius  U3600S  electronic balance,  with  a precision of 0.1 mg. A  variety  of laboratory vessels, including beakers, test tubes, flasks, and micropipettes, were employed for the implementation of the diverse measurements.   the  homogenization  of   utilised   surfactant  molecules   The  phosalone  (99%  pure)  is  sourced  from Sigma-Aldrich,  a  company  based  in  Germany. The are cetyltrimethylammonium  chloride  (CTAC,  98% m/m,  in  aqueous  solution  d=  0.968)  with  the empirical formula  CH3(CH2)15N(CH3)3Cl,  and sodium  dodecyl  sulfate  (SDS)  with  the  empirical formula  CH3(CH2)11SO4Na  (98%,  d  =  1.01)  are also procured from Sigma Aldrich. Fig. 1 depicts the chemical structure of phosalone, while Table 1 enumerates its physicochemical properties.   to  gain   The  conductivity  measurement  procedure  was employed the  micellar insight behavior  of  the  surfactant-phosalone  mixture  in aqueous media. The values of conductivity were recorded  with  the  aid  of  a  digital  conductivity meter, which was equipped with a measuring cell and  a  temperature  sensor.  The  temperature  at which  the  solution  is  prepared  is  fixed  at  a specific value. Subsequently, 0.2 mL of the titrant solution  is  taken  and  poured  into  a  beaker containing  150  mL  of  a  solution  with  a  known concentration  of  the  insecticide.  This  volume  is sufficient electrode. to is  placed  on  a Subsequently, magnetic stirrer, which may facilitate the heating of  the  solution.  The  solution  is  simultaneously homogenized  through  stirring,  and  a  reading  of is  obtained.  The the  specific  conductivity recorded conductivity values of the mixture were plotted  against the  corresponding  surfactant concentrations  in  order  to  determine  the  critical micelle concentration (CMC).   immerse the  beaker   2.5  Determination   In order to ascertain the degree of spontaneity of the  micellar reaction  of self-aggregation insecticide  with  surfactants,  we  proceeded  to determine  the  thermodynamic  parameters  of micellisation and the degree of ionisation α of the counterions.   The  degree  of  micellar  ionisation  α  of  the counterions  in  the  solution  can  be  determined from the ratio of the slopes observed before and after  the  critical  micelle  concentration  (CMC) (Raoul  Zana).  The  micellar  free  energy  (ΔG⁰) was  calculated  by  solving equation: 2015).   Table 1.

The  entropy  associated  with the micellisation process can be calculated using the following: equation:   3.1 Effect  of  Phosalone  on  the  Critical   The  experiment  entails  monitoring  the  evolution of the specific conductivity of an initial solution of fixed  concentration  as  a phosalone  with  a function  of  the  variation  in  concentration  of anionic  surfactant  SDS  or  cationic  surfactant CTAC,  which  are  added  using  a  micropipette. The  effect  of  phosalone  concentration  on  the CMC and α of the two surfactants was evaluated at various temperatures (301.15, 306.15, 311.15, 316.15,  and  321.15  K).  For  each  temperature, the  same  trend  in  CMC  and  α  as  a  function  of consistently concentration  was insecticide observed. The results obtained at  301.15  K  was presented  in  Table  2.  It  is  anticipated  that  ionic   surfactants  will  undergo  complete  ionisation  in solution, thereby establishing a direct correlation between surfactant concentration.   conductivity   in  comparison   At  the  outset  of  the  dosage  regimen,  a  slight increase in specific conductivity is observed as a concentration. surfactant function Subsequently,  the  surfactant  dissolves  in  water, resulting  in  the  formation  of  simple  monomers. The  monomeric  surfactant  molecules  display enhanced  mobility their aggregated  form  (Daneshvar  et  al.  2004).  In  the vicinity  of the  critical  micelle  concentration (CMC),  the  monomers  gradually  assemble  to form micellar aggregates.  Upon  reaching  CMC,  a  pronounced and precipitous surge in the specific conductivity is linear enhancement  of  conductivity  values  with  the increase  in  surfactant  concentration  proceeds with  a  smaller  slope  following  the  CMC.  This results in a  less pronounced increase in specific conductivity.  The  values  of  CMC,  α,  and  ΔG° obtained  at  varying  concentrations  of  phosalone are presented in Table 2.   approximately   observed.   spherical   As  illustrated  in  Table  2,  there  is  a  notable decline in both CMC and degree of ionisation as the  concentration  of  phosalone  increases.  The progressive  decrease  in  CMC  values  as  a function  of  insecticide  concentrations  suggests the  presence  of  an interaction  between phosalone  and  surfactants.  This  phenomenon may  be  attributed  to  the  solubilisation  of  the phosalone  insecticide  in  each  of  the  surfactants utilised. In all instances, the absolute value of the free  enthalpy  of  micellisation  (ΔG°)  is  observed phosalone to concentration.  In  other  words,  the  presence  of the  insecticide  in  aqueous  solution  results  in  an increased  propensity  for  the  formation  of  the micellar  phase,  which  consequently  reduces  the CMC.  From  this,  we  can  infer  that  phosalone functions  as  a  co-surfactant  in  the  micellisation   increase  with   increasing   process  (Debbabi  et  al.  2008).  The  variation  in surfactant  CMC  as  a  function  of  phosalone concentration is illustrated in Fig. 2.   The  plot  of  the  curve  of  the  critical  micellar concentration  as  a  function  of  the  concentration of phosalone (CMC = f ([PSL]) allows us to see a progressive  decrease  in  the  CMC  for  increasing concentrations  of  the  pesticide.  However,  this decrease  is  more  significant  at  level  of  the anionic  surfactant  SDS  (Singh  et  al.  2024).  To properly  explain  this  decrease  in  CMC  in  the presence  of  phosalone,  it  is  important  to  see  its chemical  structure.  Indeed,  this  molecule  of chemical formula  C12H15ClNO4PS2  with  a hydrophobic  part  comprising  the  benzene  ring and  polar  bonds  (C-Cl,  C=O,  P=O,  C-N)  shows   that it has a very high permanent dipole moment (Broniatowski  and  Latka  2008).  In  solution,  it demonstrates  a  robust  capacity  to  interact  with the  tails  of  surfactants.  It  should  be  noted, however,  that  the  non-polar  sections  of  the molecule are also capable of interacting with the polar  heads  of  surfactants.  This  phenomenon allows  highly  hydrophobic  organic  compound  to make for  micellar solubilisation (Sarr et al. 2022, Sarr et al. 2017). The  existence  of  this  dipole  moment  shows  that solubilisation  takes  place  at  the  water/micelle interface.  Phosalone  increases  the  action  of CTAC  and  SDS  by  adsorbing  at  the  interface while  at  the  same  time  decreasing  the  surface tension of the micelles. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 3.   favorable  associations   Table 2. Micellisation parameters values as a function of phosalone concentration at 301.15 K   Fig. 2. CMC variation of SDS (A) and CTAC (B) as a function of phosalone concentration at 301.15 K   Fig. 3. α variation of SDS (A) and CTAC (B) as a function of phosalone concentration at   surfactant   demonstrates   In  both  instances,  a  reduction  of  α  is  evident  as the  concentration  of  phosalone  increases.  The a  more SDS pronounced  reduction  of  α, indicative  of  a substantial  solubilisation  of  phosalone  within  the core  of  the  micelles.  This  is  attributable  to  an increase  in  hydrophobic  attraction  forces,  which results in a reduction of α at the CMC.   The  same  assay  was  conducted,  with  specific conductivity monitored as a function of surfactant concentration  at  varying  temperatures  and  at  a fixed concentration of phosalone (2.5x10-7 M). As indicated  in  section  2.5,  the  value  of  ΔH⁰  is calculated using the provided equation 3.   The  representative  curve  of 𝑙𝑛𝑋𝐶𝑀𝐶 = 𝑓(𝑇) was used to obtain the term  𝑑 (𝑙𝑛𝑋𝐶𝑀𝐶) of equation 𝑑𝑇 3,  which  is  the  slope  (Fig.  4).  Subsequently,  the value  of  ΔS⁰  was  determined  using  equation  4, following the calculation of ΔG⁰ using equation 1.   A review of the data presented in Table 3 reveals a  significant  correlation  between  temperature and CMC. It was observed that the concentration in of  CMC  decreased  with  an temperature.  This  results  in  the  dehydration  of the  hydrophilic  component  (polar  heads)  of  the surfactants,  which favours  micellisation. Moreover, the interaction of water molecules with hydrophobic  groups  (linear  surfactant  chains) may  facilitate  the  process  of  micellisation  by   increase   increasing  the  solubility  of  the  pesticide  (Sarr  et al. 2022, Sarr et al. 2017). Similarly, Thiaré et al. observed  this  phenomenon  when  analysing  the insecticide  fenvalerate  in  an  inverse  micellar medium fluorescence (Thiaré et al. 2024).   photoinduced   The  thermodynamic  parameters  associated  with the  association  reaction  of  surfactants  with phosalone  were  calculated  using  equations  (1), (2)  and  (3).  The  values  of  ΔG⁰,  ΔH⁰  and  -TΔS⁰ are presented in Table 3.   The  negative  values  of  free  enthalpy  (ΔG°) obtained indicate that the micellisation process is thermodynamically  favourable  (Sarr  et  al.  2022, Sarr  et  al.  2017,  Thiaré  et  al.  2024).  These values  demonstrate  a  clear  decrease  with increasing  temperature,  which  indicates  that  the solubility increases  with of temperature.   phosalone   Furthermore,  the  ΔH°  values  are  positive  in  all cases  and  increase  with  temperature,  indicating that  the  process  is  endothermic  and  that  water molecules  near  the  hydrophobic  part  of  the surfactants  are  undergoing  degradation.  This demonstrates  that  heat  is  transferred  from  the surrounding  environment  to  the  micellar  system, which  is  the  underlying  cause  of  the  observed increase in the system's enthalpy. It is described as  an  energetically  ascending  process  (Sarr  et al. 2022, Sarr et al. 2017).   Fig. 4. Representation of lnXCMC as a function of temperature, SDS (A) and CTAC (B)   principles   free  enthalpy   accordance  with   In of thermodynamics, if a process is endothermic, the (ΔG°)  must  be variation negative.  This  is  contingent  upon  the  enthalpy factor (ΔH°) and entropy factor (TΔS°) exhibiting a  positive  and  negative  variation,  respectively, with |TΔS°| being greater than ΔH°.   is  evidenced  by   This the  positive  entropy variation observed in our study,  which increases with  temperature.  The  results  demonstrate  that the micellisation of the insecticide phosalone with SDS and CTAC is spontaneous.   The  enthalpy-entropy  compensation  can  be obtained  by  utilising linear  relationship between ΔH0 and ΔS0. As illustrated in Equation 4,  when  a  process  exhibits  a  positive  enthalpy   change, it is also accompanied by an increase in entropy (ΔS0 > 0). The fact that |TΔS°| is greater than  ΔH0  indicates  that  the  association  reaction between  phosalone  and  surfactants  (SDS  and CTAC) is partially controlled by the entropy term. This  demonstrates  that  the  rise  in  enthalpy during  micellisation  is  counterbalanced  by  the growth the  system.  This expansion  in  entropy  may  be  attributed  to  the aggregation of the hydrophobic component of the micelles,  as  well  as  the  release  of  counterions (Aguiar  2002).  A  representative  plot  of  ΔH0 versus ΔS0 is illustrated in Fig. 5.   in  disorder  within   The  ∆H0  plot  according  to  ∆S0  shows  a  linear curve,  thus  showing  a  compensation  between enthalpy  and  entropy.

The  higher value  of  ΔH0  was  found  in  SDS.  Table  4  shows the values of ΔH0 and TC.   surfactant   In  order  to  study  the  solubilisation  process  of some  organic  compounds  and  their  interaction the with solutions,  we  used conductometric  measurement  method to solubilise  the  pesticide  phosalone  in  SDS  and CTAC. A study of the micellar properties of ionic surfactants  used  in  the  micellar  solubilisation  of phosalone was also carried out. These properties are the CMC and α. The application of these two surfactant  molecules  (CTAC  and  SDS)  in  the micellar  solubilisation  of  the  insecticide  was carried  out  by  measuring  the  conductivity  at different  temperature.  The  CMC  values  of  ionic surfactant  in  aqueous  medium  decrease  linearly with  the  concentration  of  phosalone  and  the   in  each  case  reveal   temperature.  The  results  obtained  from  these studies  showed  that  the  temperature  and  the concentration of phosalone favor the formation of the  micellar  phase.

The analysis of the results based on the calculation  of  the  thermodynamic  parameters showed that phosalone solubilises in the micellar phase. In both cases, the solubilisation occurs at the water-micelle interface.

Protection  systems  under  increased  share  of  renewable\nsources became more challenging with diverse topology changes originated from the addition, disconnection, or islanding of\ndistributed generation to secure increasing energy demands. This paper aims to implement an adaptive protection control unit\ninterlinked with an interactive monitoring system to enable the real-world application of smart adaptive protection schemes for\nmodern distribution networks under increased hosting capacity of distributed renewable sources. An adaptive protection control\nkit is experimentally developed to enable the automatic adjustment of optimal relay settings in response to network topology\nchanges arising from the integration of  distributed generation. A set of relay settings are pre-optimized within a small-scale\nmeshed network under possible network topologies and stored offline via a master microcontroller which then uses the online\nbreaker status to identify the corresponding network topology and accordingly adjust the pre-optimized relay settings. A human\nmachine interface is further designed and interlinked with the experimentally developed control kit via a slave microcontroller,\nproviding real-time data of actual current measurements and waveforms together with topological changes and self-adaptation\nof pre-optimized relay settings. Experimental results showed successful adjustment of pre-optimized relay settings in response\nto topological changes while achieving coordination time intervals within acceptable limits under the tested network topologies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nIntroduction\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe energy transition plays an increasingly important role\nin  triggering  the  shift  towards  more  localized  renewable\npotential  [1].  Operation  and  planning  of  distribution\nnetworks  under  increased  hosting  capacity  of  distributed\nrenewable  sources  are  facing  considerable  challenges,\nrequiring  new  practices  and  more  modern  technologies  to\nensure  safe,  reliable,  and  secure  power  system  operation.\nProtection  under  increased  electrification  is  of  greatest\ninterest with diverse network topology changes altering the\nfault current levels further requiring modernized protection\nsystems to dynamically perform relay recalibration to avoid\nmiscoordination  of  protective  devices  [2].  This  concept  is\nreferred as ‘Adaptive Protection Scheme’ and requires key\ndigital  advancements  in  power  systems’  operation  and\nplanning\nincluding  automatic  control,  communication\nprotocols,  and  monitoring  systems  [3,4].  This  paper\naddresses these aspects by implementing a smart  adaptive\nprotection  control  unit  and  monitoring  system for  modern\ndistribution  networks  under  increased  hosting  capacity  of\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\ntowards  fostering\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthe\ndistributed  renewable  sources,\nautomation and digitization of distribution substations. This\nresearch work has been conducted on two phases. Phase-1,\npublished  in  [5],  was  targeting  the  operational  simulation\nphase  of  the  adaptive  protection  scheme  by  developing  a\nsimulation  platform  interlinking  the  operation  of  adaptive\nprotection  scheme  with  the  optimization  process  of  relay\nsettings  in  response  to  dynamic  changes  of  network\ntopologies.  Phase-2,  which  is  presented  in  this  paper,\nextends the previous work to investigate the implementation\nof the adaptive protection control unit for enabling its real-\nworld application within modern distribution networks. An\nexperimental  set-up  is  developed  to  provide  a  complete\ntestbed  for  the  implementation  of  the  adaptive  protection\ncontrol  unit.  To  enable  implementing  the  adaptive  control\nsystem,  a  small-scale  three-bus  ring  network  is  developed\nin  the  power  system  laboratory  to  study  the  real-time\nresponse  of  the  implemented  adaptive  protection  control\nscheme.  Pre-optimized  relay  settings  are  stored  and  sent\noffline to an Arduino  Master microcontroller that uses the\nonline breaker status to identify the network topology, and\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\naccordingly adjust the optimum relay settings in response to\ntopological changes. A Human Machine Interface (HMI) is\nfully  integrated  with  the  implemented  adaptive  protection\ncontrol unit via a secondary Slave Arduino microcontroller\nproviding a complete supervision and monitoring system to\nobserve dynamic changes of network topologies, real-time\ndata of actual current measurements and self-adaptation of\nrelay settings.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThroughout the years, several researchers have carried out\nvaluable  insights  to  develop  adaptive  protection  schemes\nbased  on  effective  optimization  algorithms  [6–10].  It  has\nbeen  noticed  that  research  is  this  area  was  focused  on\nminimizing  the relay  trip  times  in  response  to  topological\nchanges  using  advanced  artificial  intelligence  algorithms.\nHowever,  less  interest  has  been  given  to  the  real-time\nsimulation of adaptive protection control strategy to enable\nthe  automatic  adjustment  of  optimized  relay  settings.  In\ndistribution substations, the dynamic response is of extreme\nimportance  when  assessing  the  technical  feasibility  of\nintroducing  new  technologies  like  adaptive  protection\nschemes  within  existing  grid  infrastructures.  In  addition,\ngrid  operators  will  need  cutting-edge  digital  solutions  to\nmonitor  every  single  change  in  networks  operation  and\nmanage the larger uptake of renewables into the electricity\ngrid.  This  therefore  necessitates  coupling  the  automatic\ncontrol  of  distribution  substations  with  the  supervisory\ncontrol of such systems to ensure power system reliability\nand  energy  system  security.  To  address  this  research  gap,\nthis  paper  will  implement  a  fully  integrated  adaptive\nprotection  control  and  monitoring  system\nto  enable\nobserving  the  real-time  response  of  adaptive  protection\ncontrol schemes towards their real-world application within\nmodern distribution systems. To build-up on the operational\nsimulation  platform  developed  in  [5],  the  same  three-bus\nring network that was previously considered has been used\nin  this  research  to  observe  the  real-time  response  of  the\nimplemented adaptive protection control unit. Further data\nanalysis is conducted to validate the simulation results with\nreal-time  experimental  results  obtained  by  the  authors  of\nthis research. This experimental validation is key driver in\nassessing  the  feasibility  of  the  pre-developed  operational\nsimulation platform to be used as a powerful tool for power\nsystem developers to emulate the anticipated performance\nof adaptive protection control systems, further saving time\nand efforts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo  allow  investigating  the  real-time  response  of  adaptive\nprotection  control  schemes,  a  small-scale  three-bus  ring\nnetwork was developed in the power system laboratory of\nthe Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime\nTransport.  The  network  under  investigation  is  of  meshed\nstructure,  fed  from  two  generation  sources  acting  as  the\nmain  grid  with  an  additional  distributed  generation  (DG)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nsource as shown in Fig. 1. Four overcurrent relays were used\nto protect the considered network, referred as K1, K2, K3 and\nK4 as illustrated in Fig. 1. The network is tested under two\nproposed  network  topologies:  the  first  one  examines  the\nsystem when only fed from the utility grid while the second\ntests the system in the presence of the additional DG source\nin grid-connected mode. A combined MATLAB simulation\nand  optimization  platform  was  used  to  optimize  the  relay\nsettings in response to topological changes. Details of relay\nsettings’ optimization process can be found in [5]. Table 1\nshows  the  relays’  pre-optimized  time  dial  settings  (TDSs)\nunder each of the tested network topologies. Table 2 shows\nthe relay trip times obtained using the pre-optimized TDSs\nfor a single-line-to-ground fault applied at busbar 3 (F3) [5].\nFor  fault  F3  under  network  topology  1,  K3  and  K2  act  as\nprimary relays while K1 acts as the backup relay in case K2\nor  K3  fails  to  operate.  Given  that  the  DG  unit  is  inactive\nunder network topology 1, then K4 will goes out of service\nin this case. For fault F3 under network topology 2, K2 and\nK3  act  as  primary  relays  while  K1  and  K4  act  as  backup\nrelays in case K2 or K3 fails to operate.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 1 Single-line diagram of the three-bus ring network\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTable 1 Pre-optimized relay TDSs under the tested network\ntopologies\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.4**\nTopology 1\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.6**r== 0.4**\nTopology 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTable 2 Relay trip times at fault F3 under the tested\nnetwork topologies\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nDescription\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nTopology 1\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.8**r== 0.2**\nTopology 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.7**r== 0.3**\nTrip time\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\nTrip time\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nPrimary 1\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nPrimary 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nBackup 1\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nBackup 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nImplementation  of  Adaptive  Protection\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAn adaptive protection control unit and monitoring system\nis experimentally developed to study the real-time response\nof the adaptive protection scheme in responding to network\ntopology  changes.  Pre-optimized  relay  settings  given  in\nTable 1 are stored into a look-up table for possible network\ntopologies and sent offline to an Arduino microcontroller.\nThe system controller then detects the online breaker status\nto  identify  the  existing  network  topology  and  accordingly\nadjust  the  pre-optimized  relay  settings  further  performing\nthe anticipated trip actions using controlled actuators. Fig. 2\nillustrates  the  schematic  diagram  of  the  implemented\nadaptive protection control unit and monitoring system. As\nillustrated in Fig. 2, an experimental setup is developed in\nthe power system laboratory to emulate the network under\ninvestigation. The implemented adaptive protection control\nunit consisted of three-phase contactors acting as motorized\ncircuit  breakers  to  protect  the  developed  network,  an\nArduino-based  primary  microcontroller  to  enable  the\nautomatic adjustment of pre-optimized relay settings, and a\npre-programmed  relay  module  providing  the  contactors\nwith  the  control  signals  to  enable  fulfilling  the  required\nbreaking actions. The control process of adaptive protection\nscheme can be traced through the inner and outer loops as\nshown\nloop),\nthe\nmicrocontroller  1  is responsible  of  gathering  two  types  of\ndata  input:  the  first  is  the  status  of  installed  contactors  to\nidentify the network topology, and the second is the actual\ncurrent  measurements  continuously  acquired  to  enable\ndetecting any abnormal condition.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nin  Fig.  2.

As  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  3,\ncontactor  panels  K1,  K2,  K3  and  K4  are  mounted  and\nconnected  to  feeders  1,2,  3  and  4  respectively,  acting  as\ncontrolled circuit breakers. It should be noted that contactor\nK4 together with feeder 4 are out of service in the absence\nof  DG  incoming  source  under  network  topology  1.  In\nnetwork topology 2, the additional DG source is injected in\ngrid-connected mode via feeder 4 and synchronised with the\nmain  power  supply  using  a  synchronizing  unit  indicator\nthrough “bright-dark lamps” method. A voltage, frequency\nand phase sequence meters are also used to check the two\nsources  are  satisfying  the  necessary  conditions  for  their\nparallel  operation.

The developed control kit board\nmainly  consisted  of  4  current  transformers  (CTs)  together\nwith  the  associated  signal  conditioning  circuits  to  enable\nmeasuring the current flowing throughout the 4 feeders and\ndetecting  the  event  of  any  fault  occurrence,  a  4-channel\nrelay module interface providing the control trip signals to\nthe 4 contactor panels, 2 microcontrollers to implement and\nsupervise  the  adaptive  control  sequence  and  4  current\nmeters providing a correct calibration with the CT readings.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 2 Schematic diagram of the implemented adaptive protection\ncontrol unit and monitoring system\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 3 Experimental setup of the three-bus ring network\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nmicrocontroller  1.

Fig.  16  shows  the\nexperimental backup trip time sequences of contactors K1,\nK2, K3 and K4 at the time the fault occurred under network\ntopology 2. From Fig. 16, the backup contactor K1 is seen\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nachieving a trip time of 1.29s while K4 is seen achieving a\ntrip  time  of  1.4s.  These  results  are  closely  matching  with\nthose  previously  given  in  Table  2.  Fig.  17  illustrates  the\ncoordination  time  intervals  achieved  between  primary\ncontactor K2 and backup contactors K1 and K4. To enable\nobserving the coordination time intervals achieved, a virtual\ntrip time signal is illustrated for K2 when it is supposed to\nwork properly to trip the fault.  As can be seen from Fig. 17,\na coordination interval of 320ms is seen achieved between\nK1  and  K2  while  a  coordination  interval  of  430ms  is  seen\nachieved  between  K4  and  K2,  therefore  being  maintained\nwithin acceptable limits for coordination intervals between\nprimary and backup relay pairs (no more than 500ms).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 15 Experimental backup response of K1, K2, K3 and K4 for\nfault F3 under network topology 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 12 Experimental primary response of K1, K2, K3 and K4 for\nfault F3 under network topology 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 16 Experimental backup trip time sequence of K1, K2, K3\nand K4 for fault F3 under network topology 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 13 Experimental primary trip time response of K3 for fault F3\nunder network topology 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 14 Experimental primary trip time response of K2 for fault F3\nunder network topology 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFig. 17 Experimental results of coordination time intervals\nachieved for fault F3 under network topology 2\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n7  Experimental Validation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo  enable  assessing  the  technical  feasibility  of  the  pre-\ndeveloped adaptive protection simulation platform in [5], a\ncomparative analysis is held between the simulation results\nobtained  in  [5]  and  the  real-time  experimental  results\nobtained in this research.

The  HMI  is  designed  using\nLabVIEW  software  and  consists  of  4  current  gauges  as\nshown in Fig. 20, to enable monitoring the real-time current\nmeasurements  passing  through  contactors  K1,  K2,  K3  and\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\ntopology\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nto  each  network\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nK4.

To  ensure  accurate\nmonitoring  of  real-time  actual  current  measurements,  the\nHMI  current  readings  are  carefully  calibrated  with  the\nactual current measurements provided by the current meters\nof the experimental setup during normal operation before a\nfault is being applied to busbar 3. On the right-hand side of\nthe designed HMI visualization screen, there is an alarming\nand notifications section for the user. A red LED alarm is\nused to notify the user whenever a fault occurs. In addition,\na  set  of  tabs  are  used  to  display  the  pre-optimized  TDSs\ncorresponding\nto  enable\nmonitoring the self-adaptation of relays settings in response\nto  network  topology  changes.

Protection  systems  under  increased  share  of  renewable sources became more challenging with diverse topology changes originated from the addition, disconnection, or islanding of distributed generation to secure increasing energy demands. This paper aims to implement an adaptive protection control unit interlinked with an interactive monitoring system to enable the real-world application of smart adaptive protection schemes for modern distribution networks under increased hosting capacity of distributed renewable sources. An adaptive protection control kit is experimentally developed to enable the automatic adjustment of optimal relay settings in response to network topology changes arising from the integration of  distributed generation. A set of relay settings are pre-optimized within a small-scale meshed network under possible network topologies and stored offline via a master microcontroller which then uses the online breaker status to identify the corresponding network topology and accordingly adjust the pre-optimized relay settings. A human machine interface is further designed and interlinked with the experimentally developed control kit via a slave microcontroller, providing real-time data of actual current measurements and waveforms together with topological changes and self-adaptation of pre-optimized relay settings. Experimental results showed successful adjustment of pre-optimized relay settings in response to topological changes while achieving coordination time intervals within acceptable limits under the tested network topologies.   The energy transition plays an increasingly important role in  triggering  the  shift  towards  more  localized  renewable potential  [1].  Operation  and  planning  of  distribution networks  under  increased  hosting  capacity  of  distributed renewable  sources  are  facing  considerable  challenges, requiring  new  practices  and  more  modern  technologies  to ensure  safe,  reliable,  and  secure  power  system  operation. Protection  under  increased  electrification  is  of  greatest interest with diverse network topology changes altering the fault current levels further requiring modernized protection systems to dynamically perform relay recalibration to avoid miscoordination  of  protective  devices  [2].  This  concept  is referred as ‘Adaptive Protection Scheme’ and requires key digital  advancements  in  power  systems’  operation  and planning including  automatic  control,  communication protocols,  and  monitoring  systems  [3,4].  This  paper addresses these aspects by implementing a smart  adaptive protection  control  unit  and  monitoring  system for  modern distribution  networks  under  increased  hosting  capacity  of   towards  fostering   the distributed  renewable  sources, automation and digitization of distribution substations. This research work has been conducted on two phases. Phase-1, published  in  [5],  was  targeting  the  operational  simulation phase  of  the  adaptive  protection  scheme  by  developing  a simulation  platform  interlinking  the  operation  of  adaptive protection  scheme  with  the  optimization  process  of  relay settings  in  response  to  dynamic  changes  of  network topologies.  Phase-2,  which  is  presented  in  this  paper, extends the previous work to investigate the implementation of the adaptive protection control unit for enabling its real- world application within modern distribution networks. An experimental  set-up  is  developed  to  provide  a  complete testbed  for  the  implementation  of  the  adaptive  protection control  unit.  To  enable  implementing  the  adaptive  control system,  a  small-scale  three-bus  ring  network  is  developed in  the  power  system  laboratory  to  study  the  real-time response  of  the  implemented  adaptive  protection  control scheme.  Pre-optimized  relay  settings  are  stored  and  sent offline to an Arduino  Master microcontroller that uses the online breaker status to identify the network topology, and   accordingly adjust the optimum relay settings in response to topological changes. A Human Machine Interface (HMI) is fully  integrated  with  the  implemented  adaptive  protection control unit via a secondary Slave Arduino microcontroller providing a complete supervision and monitoring system to observe dynamic changes of network topologies, real-time data of actual current measurements and self-adaptation of relay settings.   Throughout the years, several researchers have carried out valuable  insights  to  develop  adaptive  protection  schemes based  on  effective  optimization  algorithms  [6–10].  It  has been  noticed  that  research  is  this  area  was  focused  on minimizing  the relay  trip  times  in  response  to  topological changes  using  advanced  artificial  intelligence  algorithms. However,  less  interest  has  been  given  to  the  real-time simulation of adaptive protection control strategy to enable the  automatic  adjustment  of  optimized  relay  settings.  In distribution substations, the dynamic response is of extreme importance  when  assessing  the  technical  feasibility  of introducing  new  technologies  like  adaptive  protection schemes  within  existing  grid  infrastructures.  In  addition, grid  operators  will  need  cutting-edge  digital  solutions  to monitor  every  single  change  in  networks  operation  and manage the larger uptake of renewables into the electricity grid.  This  therefore  necessitates  coupling  the  automatic control  of  distribution  substations  with  the  supervisory control of such systems to ensure power system reliability and  energy  system  security.  To  address  this  research  gap, this  paper  will  implement  a  fully  integrated  adaptive protection  control  and  monitoring  system to  enable observing  the  real-time  response  of  adaptive  protection control schemes towards their real-world application within modern distribution systems. To build-up on the operational simulation  platform  developed  in  [5],  the  same  three-bus ring network that was previously considered has been used in  this  research  to  observe  the  real-time  response  of  the implemented adaptive protection control unit. Further data analysis is conducted to validate the simulation results with real-time  experimental  results  obtained  by  the  authors  of this research. This experimental validation is key driver in assessing  the  feasibility  of  the  pre-developed  operational simulation platform to be used as a powerful tool for power system developers to emulate the anticipated performance of adaptive protection control systems, further saving time and efforts.   To  allow  investigating  the  real-time  response  of  adaptive protection  control  schemes,  a  small-scale  three-bus  ring network was developed in the power system laboratory of the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport.  The  network  under  investigation  is  of  meshed structure,  fed  from  two  generation  sources  acting  as  the main  grid  with  an  additional  distributed  generation  (DG)   source as shown in Fig. 1. Four overcurrent relays were used to protect the considered network, referred as K1, K2, K3 and K4 as illustrated in Fig. 1. The network is tested under two proposed  network  topologies:  the  first  one  examines  the system when only fed from the utility grid while the second tests the system in the presence of the additional DG source in grid-connected mode. A combined MATLAB simulation and  optimization  platform  was  used  to  optimize  the  relay settings in response to topological changes. Details of relay settings’ optimization process can be found in [5]. Table 1 shows  the  relays’  pre-optimized  time  dial  settings  (TDSs) under each of the tested network topologies. Table 2 shows the relay trip times obtained using the pre-optimized TDSs for a single-line-to-ground fault applied at busbar 3 (F3) [5]. For  fault  F3  under  network  topology  1,  K3  and  K2  act  as primary relays while K1 acts as the backup relay in case K2 or  K3  fails  to  operate.  Given  that  the  DG  unit  is  inactive under network topology 1, then K4 will goes out of service in this case. For fault F3 under network topology 2, K2 and K3  act  as  primary  relays  while  K1  and  K4  act  as  backup relays in case K2 or K3 fails to operate.   Table 1 Pre-optimized relay TDSs under the tested network topologies   Table 2 Relay trip times at fault F3 under the tested network topologies   Implementation  of  Adaptive  Protection   An adaptive protection control unit and monitoring system is experimentally developed to study the real-time response of the adaptive protection scheme in responding to network topology  changes.  Pre-optimized  relay  settings  given  in Table 1 are stored into a look-up table for possible network topologies and sent offline to an Arduino microcontroller. The system controller then detects the online breaker status to  identify  the  existing  network  topology  and  accordingly adjust  the  pre-optimized  relay  settings  further  performing the anticipated trip actions using controlled actuators. Fig. 2 illustrates  the  schematic  diagram  of  the  implemented adaptive protection control unit and monitoring system. As illustrated in Fig. 2, an experimental setup is developed in the power system laboratory to emulate the network under investigation. The implemented adaptive protection control unit consisted of three-phase contactors acting as motorized circuit  breakers  to  protect  the  developed  network,  an Arduino-based  primary  microcontroller  to  enable  the automatic adjustment of pre-optimized relay settings, and a pre-programmed  relay  module  providing  the  contactors with  the  control  signals  to  enable  fulfilling  the  required breaking actions. The control process of adaptive protection scheme can be traced through the inner and outer loops as shown loop), the microcontroller  1  is responsible  of  gathering  two  types  of data  input:  the  first  is  the  status  of  installed  contactors  to identify the network topology, and the second is the actual current  measurements  continuously  acquired  to  enable detecting any abnormal condition.   in  Fig.  2.  In   inner  path  (blue   The outer path (red loop) shows the track of data output in which  microcontroller  1  adjusts  the  appropriate  relay settings  based  on  the  identified  network  topology  further allowing the programmed relays to send the tripping signals to the contactors for fulfilling the required action whenever the controller detects the risk of a fault occurrence. During the time of fault, the current signal waveforms are captured and  displayed  using  a  visual  oscilloscope  to  observe  the real-time response of the implemented adaptive protection approach. An HMI is finally designed and interlinked with the experimentally developed setup via microcontroller 2 to implemented enable  monitoring  and  supervising adaptive protection control scheme.   4  Experimental Set-up   Fig. 3 illustrates the experimental set-up developed for the three-bus  ring  network.  As  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  3, contactor  panels  K1,  K2,  K3  and  K4  are  mounted  and connected  to  feeders  1,2,  3  and  4  respectively,  acting  as controlled circuit breakers. It should be noted that contactor K4 together with feeder 4 are out of service in the absence of  DG  incoming  source  under  network  topology  1.  In network topology 2, the additional DG source is injected in grid-connected mode via feeder 4 and synchronised with the main  power  supply  using  a  synchronizing  unit  indicator through “bright-dark lamps” method. A voltage, frequency and phase sequence meters are also used to check the two sources  are  satisfying  the  necessary  conditions  for  their parallel  operation.  Fig.  4  illustrates  the  implemented adaptive  protection  control  kit  developed  to  enable  the automatic  adjustment  of  relay  settings  in  response  to network topology changes. The developed control kit board mainly  consisted  of  4  current  transformers  (CTs)  together with  the  associated  signal  conditioning  circuits  to  enable measuring the current flowing throughout the 4 feeders and detecting  the  event  of  any  fault  occurrence,  a  4-channel relay module interface providing the control trip signals to the 4 contactor panels, 2 microcontrollers to implement and supervise  the  adaptive  control  sequence  and  4  current meters providing a correct calibration with the CT readings.   microcontroller  1.  Fig.  6  shows  the  software  flowchart  of the implemented adaptive protection control sequence.   The development of the software code for implementing the adaptive  protection  control  system  begins  by  storing  the pre-optimized  relay  settings  corresponding  to  each  of  the tested  network  topologies  in  an  offline  manner.  The  user will then start the operation of the contactors using 4 digital input switches connected as digital inputs to microcontroller 1. The latter uses the switch status to identify the network topology, allowing the protection system to adapt itself  in response  to  the  existing  network  topology  by  configuring the appropriate setting group in an online manner. Along the current process, whole measurements are being sent to  microcontroller 1 through the  CTs  which  are  connected  as  analog to microcontroller 1, to enable detecting any fault occurrence if either one or more of the measured currents exceeded the pre-specified  current  setting.  Fig.  5  illustrates  the  overall system inputs and outputs.   operational   continuous   inputs   6  Experimental Results   Fig. 7 shows the experimental primary response of K3, K2 and  K1  at  the  time  the  fault  occurred  under  network topology  1  prior  integrating  additional  DG  source.  From Fig. 7, it is evident that contactors K3 and K2 tripped first disconnecting  feeders  2  and  3,  while  the  current  passing through  contactor  K1  is  maintained  in  operation  as  the primary relays have satisfactorily isolated the fault. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 illustrate the experimental trip time responses of primary  contactors  K3  and  K2  respectively  at  the time  the fault occurred under network topology 1. The illustrated trip time responses are computed by microcontroller 1 using the pre-optimized TDSs given in Table 1. As can be seen from Fig.  8,  K3  is  seen  tripping  after  488ms  while  K2  is  seen completely clearing the fault after 536ms as shown in Fig.9. To  observe  the  backup  response  of  the  experimentally developed adaptive protection control system, the contactor   In case of a fault occurrence, microcontroller 1 identifies the primary  and  backup  relay  pairs  and  accordingly  compute their relevant trip times using the configured relay settings belonging  to  the  existing  network  topology.  Breaking actions  are  taking  place  through  the  4  contactor  panels automatically  controlled  via  the  4-channel  relay  module with the embedded relays representing the digital outputs of   K2  has  been  disconnected  from  the  microcontroller  and powered on externally to simulate that it is kept in operation at the time the fault occurred. Fig.10 shows the experimental backup response of contactors K3, K2 and K1 at the time the fault  occurred  under  network  topology  1.  As  can  be  seen from  Fig.  10,  when  contactor  K2  is  kept  in  operation  the backup contactor K1 is seen completely clearing the fault. Fig. 11 shows the experimental backup trip time sequences of contactors K1, K2 and K3 at the time the fault occurred under network topology 1, indicating that backup contactor K1 has completely cleared the fault after 920ms. To ensure the coordination time interval between contactors K2 and K1 is  maintained  within  appropriate  margins  (no  more  than 500ms), a virtual trip time signal is illustrated for contactor K2 when the latter is supposed to appropriately trip the fault, demonstrating a coordination interval of 380ms between K1 and K2 as depicted in Fig. 11.   Fig. 12 shows the experimental primary response of K1, K2, K3  and  K4  at  the  time  the  fault  occurred  under  network topology 2 following the integration of additional DG unit in  grid-connected  mode  through feeder  4.  As  can  be  seen from Fig. 12, contactors K2 and K3 are seen tripping while the current passing through contactors K1 and K4 are kept in operation  as  the  primary  relays  have  satisfactorily  cleared the fault. Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 illustrate the experimental trip time responses of primary contactors K3 and K2 respectively at  the  time  the  fault  occurred  under  network  topology  2, showing K3 is tripping after 880ms while K2 is completely clearing  the  fault  after  990ms.  Compared  to  network topology 1, it is noticeable that K2 and K3 are seen changing relay settings satisfactorily in response to network topology 2, further updating their trip time signals accordingly.   Fig.  15  shows  the  experimental  backup  response  of contactors K1, K2, K3 and K4 at the time the fault occurred under network topology 2. As can be seen from Fig. 15, the current  passing  through  contactor  K2  is  kept  in  operation until being attenuated at the instant the backup contactor K1 is seen tripping. A few seconds later, the fault current is seen completely  cleared  by  contactor  K4.  Fig.  16  shows  the experimental backup trip time sequences of contactors K1, K2, K3 and K4 at the time the fault occurred under network topology 2. From Fig. 16, the backup contactor K1 is seen   achieving a trip time of 1.29s while K4 is seen achieving a trip  time  of  1.4s.  These  results  are  closely  matching  with those  previously  given  in  Table  2.  Fig.  17  illustrates  the coordination  time  intervals  achieved  between  primary contactor K2 and backup contactors K1 and K4. To enable observing the coordination time intervals achieved, a virtual trip time signal is illustrated for K2 when it is supposed to work properly to trip the fault.  As can be seen from Fig. 17, a coordination interval of 320ms is seen achieved between K1  and  K2  while  a  coordination  interval  of  430ms  is  seen achieved  between  K4  and  K2,  therefore  being  maintained within acceptable limits for coordination intervals between primary and backup relay pairs (no more than 500ms).   7  Experimental Validation   To  enable  assessing  the  technical  feasibility  of  the  pre- developed adaptive protection simulation platform in [5], a comparative analysis is held between the simulation results obtained  in  [5]  and  the  real-time  experimental  results obtained in this research. Fig. 18 and Fig. 19 compare the results of the pre-developed adaptive protection simulation those  obtained  experimentally  under platform  versus network topology 1 and network topology 2, respectively. As can be seen from the comparative analysis, the real-time   experimental  results  are  closely  matching  with  the  results obtained  from  the  pre-developed  adaptive  protection simulation  platform  with  only  minor  percentage  of  errors achieved. These errors are due the compiling time taken by the  microcontroller  to  execute  the  adaptive  protection control sequence and the difference between the theoretical load  flow  analysis  conducted  by the  pre-developed simulation  platform  and  the  actual  current  measurements acquired  by the  microcontroller.  This  experimental validation  has  clearly  confirmed  the  accuracy  of  the  pre- developed adaptive protection simulation platform in [5] in reflecting nearly real-time response analysis of the adaptive protection  control  scheme  towards  enabling  its  real-world application.   An HMI is fully integrated with the implemented adaptive protection  control  unit  via  microcontroller  2,  providing  a graphical user interface (GUI) for grid operators to monitor real-time data of actual current measurements acquired by microcontroller  1  together  with  self-adaptation  of  pre- optimized  relay  settings.  The  HMI  is  designed  using LabVIEW  software  and  consists  of  4  current  gauges  as shown in Fig. 20, to enable monitoring the real-time current measurements  passing  through  contactors  K1,  K2,  K3  and   topology   to  each  network   K4. A graphical scope chart is presented beside each current gauge  to  enable  visualizing  the  current  waveform  passing through  each  of  the  4  contactors.  To  ensure  accurate monitoring  of  real-time  actual  current  measurements,  the HMI  current  readings  are  carefully  calibrated  with  the actual current measurements provided by the current meters of the experimental setup during normal operation before a fault is being applied to busbar 3. On the right-hand side of the designed HMI visualization screen, there is an alarming and notifications section for the user. A red LED alarm is used to notify the user whenever a fault occurs. In addition, a  set  of  tabs  are  used  to  display  the  pre-optimized  TDSs corresponding to  enable monitoring the self-adaptation of relays settings in response to  network  topology  changes.  Visualization  results  of  the integrated  HMI  are  captured  for  fault  F3  under  network topology 1 and network topology 2 and displayed in Fig. 20 and Fig. 21 respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 20, the current  waveforms  passing  through  contactors  K2  and  K3 are  seen  interrupted  while  the  current  waveform  passing through contactor K1 is kept in operation as experimentally implemented  for  the  primary  response  of  fault  F3  under network topology 1. From Fig. 21, the current waveforms passing through contactors K2 and K3 are seen interrupted while the current waveform passing through contactors K1 and K4 are kept in operation as experimentally implemented for the primary response of fault F3 under network topology 2. Change in network topology together with pre-optimized TDSs is noted and monitored accordingly, enabling the user to  observe  the  real-time  response  of  the  implemented adaptive protection control system.   This  paper  addressed  the  implementation  of  an  adaptive protection control and monitoring system for investigating its real-time response within modern distribution networks under increased hosting capacity of distributed generation. An  adaptive  protection  control  system  is  experimentally developed,  tested,  and  validated  through  a  small-scale three-bus network under two proposed network topologies. The  implemented  adaptive  protection  control  system  has proven  effectiveness  in  responding  to  subjected  topology changes achieving  successful adjustment of pre-optimized relay  settings  while  maintaining  coordination  intervals within  acceptable  limits  under  each  of  the  tested  network topologies.  The  implemented  adaptive  protection  control system  has  been  also  used  to  experimentally  validate  the performance of a previously developed adaptive protection simulation  platform.  It  was  found  that  the  latter  reveals enough accuracy in emulating the real-world performance of adaptive protection schemes and this was confirmed by matching the simulation results with real-time experimental results. An HMI is further integrated with the implemented adaptive protection control system allowing grid operators to  observe  real-time  data  of  actual  current  measurements and self-adaptation of relay settings. The application of the implemented  adaptive  protection  control  and  monitoring system is expected to add key valuable outcomes in terms of operation and control of distribution systems, allowing to mitigate the impact of distributed generation on protection systems while providing the ability to monitor and supervise the real-time response of adaptive protection schemes.

Cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to stress, plays a pivotal role in modulating this response. Its primary function is to mobilize energy, regulate inflammation, and enhance cognitive processes during acute stress. While cortisol facilitates adaptation by suppressing overactive immune responses and ensuring resource availability, its prolonged elevation can lead to detrimental effects, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive impairments. Conversely, inadequate cortisol production disrupts the bodyâ€™s ability to manage stress, resulting in conditions like fatigue, hypotension, and impaired recovery. This study explores the dynamic relationship between stress and cortisol, emphasizing how balanced cortisol levels contribute to stress resolution and homeostasis restoration. Understanding cortisolâ€™s dual role provides insights into its potential therapeutic applications for managing stress-related disorders.",

Increased  secretion  of  cortisol  in  a\nstressful  situation  has  consequences  for  the  functioning  and\ncondition of our brain.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.1**\nThe article delves into different methods for detecting cortisol, a\nkey stress biomarker, within the framework of connected health\nsystems. It examines various techniques, with a particular focus\non  their  suitability  for  real-time  stress  monitoring  and  their\npotential  for  integration  into  wearable  devices  designed  for\ncontinuous health tracking\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.4**r== 0.1**\nThe study finds that both physiological and psychosocial stress\nhave a considerable impact on cortisol production, which, in turn,\naffects  cognitive  functions.  However,  the  link  between  cortisol\nand  cognition  is  complex,  as  the  effects  of  increased  cortisol\nlevels depend on factors like the type and duration of stress, as\nwell  as  individual  differences.  Chronic  stress  and  prolonged\nelevated  cortisol  can  negatively  affect  cognitive  abilities,\nin  memory,  attention,  and  decision-making.\nparticularly\nConversely,  short-term  stress  might  temporarily  boost  certain\ncognitive functions due to the body's adaptive responses.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.4**r== 0.1**\nChronic stress can lead to sustained high levels of cortisol, which\nmay  impair  neuroplasticity,  disrupt  the  hippocampus  (a  region\ncritical for memory and emotional regulation), and contribute to\ncognitive  decline.  This  can  be  particularly  evident  in  disorders\nlike Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety disorders. The\nstudy emphasizes that cortisol dysregulation can be a contributing\nfactor  to  the  pathophysiology  of  these  conditions,  potentially\nleading to changes in brain structure and function.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nStress is a physiological and psychological response to external or internal demands, often referred to\nas  stressors.  These  demands  challenge  an  individual's  ability  to  cope  and  adapt.  Stress  is  not  inherently\nnegative;  it  can  be  categorized  as  positive  (eustress)  or  negative  (distress)  depending  on  its  effects  on  an\nindividual.  Stress arises  when there is  a mismatch between  the  demands  placed  on an individual  and  their\nresources to cope with those demands [4].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nStress can be classified into three primary types:\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n1.  Acute Stress is short term stress that occurs in response to immediate threats or challenges. Examples\nnarrowly avoiding an accident, preparing for a presentation. Generally manageable and sometimes\nbeneficial in motivating individuals to perform well [5].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n2.  Chronic Stress is long term stress resulting from ongoing demands or challenges that do not resolve\nquickly.  The  examples  is  financial  difficulties,  ongoing  workplace  conflicts.  It  can  lead  to  serious\nhealth issues like cardiovascular disease, depression, and weakened immunity [6].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n3.

The\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nexamples are fear of failure, negative self-talk, and anxiety about the future [10].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n3.

These\nsystems coordinate the release of key hormones to help the body cope with and adapt to stress. Below are the\nmain hormones involved in the stress response and their effects:\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n1.  Cortisol (The Primary Stress Hormone). Cortisol is released by the adrenal cortex, is central to the\nHPA axis and helps the body manage acute and chronic stress.The effects are metabolic regulation is\nstimulates  gluconeogenesis  in  the  liver  to  increase  blood  glucose  levels,  immune  modulationcis\nsuppresses  pro  inflammatory  cytokines  and  adaptive  immune  responses  to  prevent  excessive\ninflammation, cardiovascular support is increases blood pressure and cardiac output by enhancing the\nresponsiveness of blood vessels to catecholamines and cognitive enhancement  mproves memory and\nfocus during acute stress. Prolonged cortisol elevation can lead to metabolic syndrome, hypertension,\nimmune suppression, and cognitive decline [13].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n2.  Adrenaline and Noradrenaline (Catecholamines). These hormones, secreted by the adrenal medulla,\nare  part  of  the  SAM system,  which mediates the  \"fight-or-flight\"  response.  The  effects are  energy\nmobilization  increases  heart  rate  and  respiration  to  deliver  oxygen  and  glucose  to  muscles,\nvasoconstriction is redirects blood flow to vital organs (heart, brain, muscles) by constricting blood\nvessels in less  critical areas.  Enhanced  alertness.  Activates the amygdala  and  prefrontal  cortex for\nquick  decision-making  and  persistent  elevation  can  cause  cardiovascular  strain  and  contribute  to\nanxiety disorders [14].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n3.  Corticotropin-Releasing  Hormone  (CRH).  CRH  is  released  by  the  hypothalamus  to  activate  the\nHPA axis and stimulate the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The effects are HPA\naxis  activation.  Facilitates  cortisol  release  from  the  adrenal  glands.  Appetite  Suppression  can\nmodulates hunger during stress by interacting with the hypothalamic feeding centers. Chronic Effects\nare prolonged CRH activity can lead to dysregulated HPA axis responses and mood disorders.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCortisol (C21H30O5), is a steroid hormone with a molecular weight of 362.46 g/mol. Cortisol is a well-\nknown biomarker of psychological and physiological stress. The level of cortisol plays an important part in\nregulating blood pressure, carbohydrate metabolism and glucose levels. It also contributes to the homeostasis\nof  cardiovascular,  renal,  immune,  endocrine  and  skeletal  systems.  Abnormally  increased  levels  of  cortisol\ninterfere  with  blood  amino  acid  and  fatty  acid  levels,  resulting  in  depression  of  the  immune  system  and\ninflammation. Severely increased levels of cortisol contribute to the development of symptoms of  obesity,\nbone fragility, and fatigue, while decreased levels of cortisol lead to Addison’s disease manifested by arterial\nhypotension, weight loss and darkened scars/skinfolds. The most dominating effects of cortisol are indicative\nof emotional or psychological stress and that is why cortisol is also called the ‘stress hormone [19].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 5.0**b== 1.0**t== 0.0**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nInternational Journal of Ecophysiology Vol.07, No.01 (2025) 48-58                                   53\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 2.

While  prolonged\ncortisol elevation is associated with negative effects, short term cortisol release is essential for managing and\nresolving stress.

Regulation  of  the  Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal  (HPA)  Axis.  The  HPA  axis  governs  cortisol\nproduction. During stress, the hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to stimulate cortisol release from\nthe adrenal glands. Cortisol, in turn, exerts a negative feedback effect on the HPA axis, reducing the\nrelease  of  corticotropin-releasing  hormone  (CRH)  and  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH).  This\nfeedback loop prevents excessive cortisol secretion and helps restore homeostasis [37].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n2.  Modulation of Inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune response by inhibiting pro-inflammatory\ncytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. This reduces inflammation, which is often elevated during chronic\nstress.  By  dampening  inflammatory  pathways,  cortisol  alleviates  physiological  stress  and  prevents\nstress-related damage to tissues [38].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n3.  Energy  Mobilization  and  Recovery.  Cortisol  facilitates  the  mobilization  of  glucose,  fats,  and  amino\nacids, providing energy to cope with immediate stressors. After the stressor is resolved, cortisol helps\nin energy restoration, promoting recovery and repair processes [39].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n4.  Regulation of Mood and Emotional Responses. Cortisol interacts with brain regions like the amygdala\nand  prefrontal  cortex,  modulating  emotional  responses  to  stress.  By  reducing  excessive  emotional\nreactivity, cortisol contributes to psychological resilience and stress recovery [40].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n5.  Sleep-Wake Regulation. Cortisol levels follow a diurnal rhythm, peaking in the morning and declining\nat night. This rhythm supports stress recovery by facilitating restorative sleep and preparing the body\nfor daily challenges. Improved sleep, in turn, reduces stress perception and enhances overall resilience\n[41].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCortisol, a vital glucocorticoid hormone, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis during stress.\nHowever,  abnormal  increases  or  decreases  in  cortisol  levels  can  have  significant  physiological  and\npsychological effects.

When the body detects a threat, the HPA axis is triggered, leading to a rise in\ncortisol levels. This hormone helps release energy reserves, slows down non-essential functions like digestion\nand  immune  activity,  and primes  the  body  for  quick action,  often  known  as  the  \"fight  or  flight\"  response.\nCortisol  is  typically  elevated  during  stressful  situations,  aiding  the  body  in  dealing  with  short-term  stress.\nHowever, when stress becomes chronic or long-lasting, it can disrupt cortisol production, potentially leading\nto negative health effects such as immune suppression, memory issues, and an increased risk of conditions like\nheart  disease  and  depression.  The  body’s  cortisol  levels  fluctuate,  rising  sharply  during  acute  stress  and\ngradually decreasing once the stressor is gone or resolved. While normal cortisol responses are beneficial and\nadaptive,  prolonged  or  excessive  cortisol  exposure  due  to  ongoing  stress  can  be  harmful,  highlighting  the\nimportance of managing stress for overall well-being.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nRecommendation\nBased on the results of this study to better manage stress and its impact on cortisol levels, individuals\nshould adopt stress reduction techniques such as mindfulness, regular physical activity, and adequate sleep.\nPsychological  interventions,  like  cognitive-behavioral  therapy,  can  help  reduce  chronic  stress  and  regulate\ncortisol  production.  Additionally,  healthcare  professionals  should  consider  monitoring  cortisol  levels  in\npatients with chronic stress, as early intervention may help prevent long-term health issues. Further research\nis also needed to explore the most effective strategies for cortisol regulation in stress-related conditions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank all to Prof. Dr. Melva Silitonga and my friend that have supported the work\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 8.0**b== 1.0**t== 0.0**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nInternational Journal of Ecophysiology Vol.07, No.01 (2025) 48-58                                   56\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors declare that  there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

Defined as the body’s response to any challenge that disrupts homeostasis, stress can manifest acutely or chronically, with   International Journal of Ecophysiology Vol.07, No.01 (2025) 48-58                                   49   varying impacts depending on its intensity and duration. The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is central to the stress response, with cortisol as its primary effector hormone [1].   Cortisol,  often  referred  to  as  the  \"stress  hormone,\"  orchestrates  several  adaptive  responses  aimed  at helping the body cope with and recover from stress. In the short term, cortisol mobilizes energy reserves by increasing glucose availability, suppresses excessive immune activity, and enhances cognitive functions such as focus and decision-making. These effects are essential for acute stress adaptation, often described as the \"fight-or-flight\" response [2].   However,  the  balance  of  cortisol  levels  is  critical.  Chronic  stress,  which  leads  to  prolonged  cortisol elevation, is associated with negative outcomes such as metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and neurocognitive decline.  On  the  other  hand,  insufficient  cortisol  production,  as  seen  in  conditions  like  Addison’s  disease, impairs  the  body's  ability  to  handle  stress,  leading  to  fatigue,  hypotension,  and  increased  vulnerability  to external stressors [3].   This article delves into the intricate relationship between stress and cortisol, examining how cortisol contributes to stress resolution and discussing the consequences of dysregulated cortisol levels. By exploring these  dynamics,  the  study  highlights  cortisol’s  potential  as  a  therapeutic  target  in  managing  stress-related disorders and promoting overall resilience.   This systematic review was performed by online searches of PubMed Google Scholar, Sciencedirect and Mendeley databases.

CRH and the HPA Axis in Stress Regulation   The  crucial  role  of  cortisol,  a  key  stress  hormone,  in  how  we respond to stress, both in the short term and over the long run. Sapolsky explains that cortisol helps the body handle acute stress by mobilizing  energy  and boosting  the fight-or-flight  response, allowing people to deal with immediate threats. However, when stress becomes chronic, sustained high levels of cortisol can have harmful effects on various bodily systems, such as the immune, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.   The  article  offers  an  in-depth  explanation  of  how  cortisol secretion is regulated and its physiological functions in the body. It  describes  how  cortisol,  a  crucial  glucocorticoid  hormone produced by the adrenal glands, is released in reaction to stress via  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis.  The  article also  highlights  the  various  impacts  of  cortisol  on  metabolism, immune function, and the body's ability to adapt to stress.   Cortisol levels follow a diurnal pattern, typically peaking in the morning shortly after waking and declining throughout the day. It is  regulated  by  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis, where releases  corticotropin-releasing hormone  (CRH),  stimulating  the  pituitary  gland  to  release adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH),  which  then  stimulates cortisol production in the adrenal glands.   the  hypothalamus   The acute stress response is a critical biological process that helps the body react to immediate threats by activating the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis.

Consequences  of  abnormal  cortisol  secretion.  Disorders  in cortisol  secretion  (particularly  hypercortisolemia)  may  cause mental disorders and can be one of the many hormonal disorders accompanying these conditions, for  example  depression.  Increased  secretion  of  cortisol  in  a stressful  situation  has  consequences  for  the  functioning  and condition of our brain.   The article delves into different methods for detecting cortisol, a key stress biomarker, within the framework of connected health systems. It examines various techniques, with a particular focus on  their  suitability  for  real-time  stress  monitoring  and  their potential  for  integration  into  wearable  devices  designed  for continuous health tracking   The study finds that both physiological and psychosocial stress have a considerable impact on cortisol production, which, in turn, affects  cognitive  functions.  However,  the  link  between  cortisol and  cognition  is  complex,  as  the  effects  of  increased  cortisol levels depend on factors like the type and duration of stress, as well  as  individual  differences.  Chronic  stress  and  prolonged elevated  cortisol  can  negatively  affect  cognitive  abilities, in  memory,  attention,  and  decision-making. particularly Conversely,  short-term  stress  might  temporarily  boost  certain cognitive functions due to the body's adaptive responses.   Chronic stress can lead to sustained high levels of cortisol, which may  impair  neuroplasticity,  disrupt  the  hippocampus  (a  region critical for memory and emotional regulation), and contribute to cognitive  decline.  This  can  be  particularly  evident  in  disorders like Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety disorders. The study emphasizes that cortisol dysregulation can be a contributing factor  to  the  pathophysiology  of  these  conditions,  potentially leading to changes in brain structure and function.   Stress is a physiological and psychological response to external or internal demands, often referred to as  stressors.  These  demands  challenge  an  individual's  ability  to  cope  and  adapt.  Stress  is  not  inherently negative;  it  can  be  categorized  as  positive  (eustress)  or  negative  (distress)  depending  on  its  effects  on  an individual.  Stress arises  when there is  a mismatch between  the  demands  placed  on an individual  and  their resources to cope with those demands [4].   Stress can be classified into three primary types:   1.  Acute Stress is short term stress that occurs in response to immediate threats or challenges. Examples narrowly avoiding an accident, preparing for a presentation. Generally manageable and sometimes beneficial in motivating individuals to perform well [5].   2.  Chronic Stress is long term stress resulting from ongoing demands or challenges that do not resolve quickly.  The  examples  is  financial  difficulties,  ongoing  workplace  conflicts.  It  can  lead  to  serious health issues like cardiovascular disease, depression, and weakened immunity [6].   3.  Episodic Acute Stress is recurring episodes of acute stress often associated with patterns of worry and overcommitment.Examples  are  requently  missing  deadlines,  consistently  feeling  overwhelmed  by responsibilities. It may lead to tension headaches, migraines, and hypertension [7].   4.  Eustress and Distress. Eustress is positive stress that enhances performance and motivation. Distress   is negative stress that overwhelms coping abilities and impairs functioning [8].   International Journal of Ecophysiology Vol.07, No.01 (2025) 48-58                                   52   Stressors are the stimuli or events that trigger a stress response. They can be classified into:   1.  Physical Stressors are Environmental factors that cause physical strain on the body for the examples   are noise, temperature extremes, physical injuries [9].   2.  Psychological  Stressors  are  internal  factors,  such  as  thoughts  or  feelings,  that  lead  to  stress.  The   examples are fear of failure, negative self-talk, and anxiety about the future [10].   3.  Social Stressors is stress originating from interpersonal relationships or social situations such as are   conflicts with friends or family, social isolation, workplace harassment [11].   4.  Daily hassles are minor, recurring stressors in everyday life. Such as are traffic jams, losing keys, or   dealing with minor workplace issues [12].   Hormones play a pivotal role in regulating the body's response to stress  through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis  and  the  sympathetic-adrenal-medullary  (SAM)  system.  These systems coordinate the release of key hormones to help the body cope with and adapt to stress. Below are the main hormones involved in the stress response and their effects:   1.  Cortisol (The Primary Stress Hormone). Cortisol is released by the adrenal cortex, is central to the HPA axis and helps the body manage acute and chronic stress.The effects are metabolic regulation is stimulates  gluconeogenesis  in  the  liver  to  increase  blood  glucose  levels,  immune  modulationcis suppresses  pro  inflammatory  cytokines  and  adaptive  immune  responses  to  prevent  excessive inflammation, cardiovascular support is increases blood pressure and cardiac output by enhancing the responsiveness of blood vessels to catecholamines and cognitive enhancement  mproves memory and focus during acute stress. Prolonged cortisol elevation can lead to metabolic syndrome, hypertension, immune suppression, and cognitive decline [13].   2.  Adrenaline and Noradrenaline (Catecholamines). These hormones, secreted by the adrenal medulla, are  part  of  the  SAM system,  which mediates the  \"fight-or-flight\"  response.  The  effects are  energy mobilization  increases  heart  rate  and  respiration  to  deliver  oxygen  and  glucose  to  muscles, vasoconstriction is redirects blood flow to vital organs (heart, brain, muscles) by constricting blood vessels in less  critical areas.  Enhanced  alertness.  Activates the amygdala  and  prefrontal  cortex for quick  decision-making  and  persistent  elevation  can  cause  cardiovascular  strain  and  contribute  to anxiety disorders [14].   3.  Corticotropin-Releasing  Hormone  (CRH).  CRH  is  released  by  the  hypothalamus  to  activate  the HPA axis and stimulate the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The effects are HPA axis  activation.  Facilitates  cortisol  release  from  the  adrenal  glands.  Appetite  Suppression  can modulates hunger during stress by interacting with the hypothalamic feeding centers. Chronic Effects are prolonged CRH activity can lead to dysregulated HPA axis responses and mood disorders.   Cortisol (C21H30O5), is a steroid hormone with a molecular weight of 362.46 g/mol. Cortisol is a well- known biomarker of psychological and physiological stress. The level of cortisol plays an important part in regulating blood pressure, carbohydrate metabolism and glucose levels. It also contributes to the homeostasis of  cardiovascular,  renal,  immune,  endocrine  and  skeletal  systems.  Abnormally  increased  levels  of  cortisol interfere  with  blood  amino  acid  and  fatty  acid  levels,  resulting  in  depression  of  the  immune  system  and inflammation. Severely increased levels of cortisol contribute to the development of symptoms of  obesity, bone fragility, and fatigue, while decreased levels of cortisol lead to Addison’s disease manifested by arterial hypotension, weight loss and darkened scars/skinfolds. The most dominating effects of cortisol are indicative of emotional or psychological stress and that is why cortisol is also called the ‘stress hormone [19].

Normal Cortisol Levels Cortisol levels are typically measured in the blood, saliva, or urine. The levels vary depending on the time of day, as they peak in the early morning and decline throughout the day. 1.  Normal Blood Cortisol Levels [20]:   •  Morning (6:00 AM - 8:00 AM): 10-20 µg/dL (275-555 nmol/L) •  Afternoon (4:00 PM - 6:00 PM): 3-10 µg/dL (80-275 nmol/L)   •  Morning: 0.15-0.6 µg/dL (4.14-16.56 nmol/L) •  Afternoon: 0.05-0.2 µg/dL (1.38-5.52 nmol/L)   •  10-100 µg/day (28-276 nmol/day)   Cortisol Levels During Stress During acute or chronic stress, cortisol levels may rise significantly above normal. 1.  Acute Stress. Blood cortisol levels can increase to  20-40 µg/dL (555-1110 nmol/L) during acute stress   events [23].   2.  Chronic Stress. Chronic exposure to stressors can elevate cortisol levels persistently or disrupt the diurnal rhythm, leading to flattened curves (e.g., higher evening levels). Urinary free cortisol levels may exceed 100 µg/day in cases of chronic stress. [24]   3.  Pathological Cortisol Levels. Cushing’s Syndrome: Cortisol >50 µg/dL (1380 nmol/L) and Addison’s   Cortisol  levels  are  typically  measured  in  blood,  saliva,  urine,  or  hair  using  various  analytical techniques. These methods vary in sensitivity, specificity, and practicality depending on the research or clinical context.

Its increase during stress serves adaptive purposes to help the body cope with and respond to external or internal challenges.   Energy Mobilization Immune Modulation Cardiovascular Support Cognitive and Behavioral Adaptation   Table 3. The aim of cortisol increase during stress   Provides energy to vital organs during stress [32] Prevents overactive immune responses and reduces inflammation [33] Enhances blood pressure and circulation [34]   Improves focus, memory, and decision-making during stress [35]   Stress Recovery and Termination   Self-regulates the stress response through negative feedback mechanisms [36]   Cortisol,  often  called  the  \"stress  hormone,\"  plays  a  dual  role  in  stress  regulation.  While  prolonged cortisol elevation is associated with negative effects, short term cortisol release is essential for managing and resolving stress. Cortisol helps the body adapt to stress by regulating various physiological and psychological processes.   1.  Regulation  of  the  Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal  (HPA)  Axis.  The  HPA  axis  governs  cortisol production. During stress, the hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to stimulate cortisol release from the adrenal glands. Cortisol, in turn, exerts a negative feedback effect on the HPA axis, reducing the release  of  corticotropin-releasing  hormone  (CRH)  and  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH).  This feedback loop prevents excessive cortisol secretion and helps restore homeostasis [37].   2.  Modulation of Inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune response by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. This reduces inflammation, which is often elevated during chronic stress.  By  dampening  inflammatory  pathways,  cortisol  alleviates  physiological  stress  and  prevents stress-related damage to tissues [38].   3.  Energy  Mobilization  and  Recovery.  Cortisol  facilitates  the  mobilization  of  glucose,  fats,  and  amino acids, providing energy to cope with immediate stressors. After the stressor is resolved, cortisol helps in energy restoration, promoting recovery and repair processes [39].   4.  Regulation of Mood and Emotional Responses. Cortisol interacts with brain regions like the amygdala and  prefrontal  cortex,  modulating  emotional  responses  to  stress.  By  reducing  excessive  emotional reactivity, cortisol contributes to psychological resilience and stress recovery [40].   5.  Sleep-Wake Regulation. Cortisol levels follow a diurnal rhythm, peaking in the morning and declining at night. This rhythm supports stress recovery by facilitating restorative sleep and preparing the body for daily challenges. Improved sleep, in turn, reduces stress perception and enhances overall resilience [41].   Cortisol, a vital glucocorticoid hormone, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis during stress. However,  abnormal  increases  or  decreases  in  cortisol  levels  can  have  significant  physiological  and psychological effects. The effect of cortisol is shown in Table 4.   International Journal of Ecophysiology Vol.07, No.01 (2025) 48-58                                   55   Table 4. Effect of cortisol   Mobilized energy, suppressed inflammation, heightened focus Hypoglycemia, hypotension, impaired stress response   Long-Term Effects Insulin resistance, hypertension, cognitive decline Fatigue, excessive inflammation, depression   Abnormal cortisol levels, whether excessively high or low, can lead to specific diseases and disorders  that  significantly  affect  the  body's  physiological  and  psychological  functions.  Diseases related to abnoemal coertisol levels are shown in Table 5.   Table 5. Disease related to abnormal cortisol levels   Symptoms Obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, depression [44]. Obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension [45]. Mood disturbances, cognitive decline, sleep issues[46]. Fatigue, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, weight loss [47]. Similar to Addison's disease without pigmentation or severe electrolyte imbalance [48]. Severe  hypotension,  abdominal  pain,  confusion,  life- threatening shock [49].   Cortisol  is  crucial  in  how  the  body  reacts  to  stress,  serving  as  a  key  element  in  the  hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When the body detects a threat, the HPA axis is triggered, leading to a rise in cortisol levels. This hormone helps release energy reserves, slows down non-essential functions like digestion and  immune  activity,  and primes  the  body  for  quick action,  often  known  as  the  \"fight  or  flight\"  response. Cortisol  is  typically  elevated  during  stressful  situations,  aiding  the  body  in  dealing  with  short-term  stress. However, when stress becomes chronic or long-lasting, it can disrupt cortisol production, potentially leading to negative health effects such as immune suppression, memory issues, and an increased risk of conditions like heart  disease  and  depression.  The  body’s  cortisol  levels  fluctuate,  rising  sharply  during  acute  stress  and gradually decreasing once the stressor is gone or resolved. While normal cortisol responses are beneficial and adaptive,  prolonged  or  excessive  cortisol  exposure  due  to  ongoing  stress  can  be  harmful,  highlighting  the importance of managing stress for overall well-being.   Recommendation Based on the results of this study to better manage stress and its impact on cortisol levels, individuals should adopt stress reduction techniques such as mindfulness, regular physical activity, and adequate sleep. Psychological  interventions,  like  cognitive-behavioral  therapy,  can  help  reduce  chronic  stress  and  regulate cortisol  production.  Additionally,  healthcare  professionals  should  consider  monitoring  cortisol  levels  in patients with chronic stress, as early intervention may help prevent long-term health issues. Further research is also needed to explore the most effective strategies for cortisol regulation in stress-related conditions.

In addition, we calculated “transmodal” vertical\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nestimates  (means  of  VV  and  PV)  to  get  a  unique  measure  of  verticality  representation  (i.e.,\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nindependent from a specific vestibular or somaesthetic modality of gravity sensing). According to\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstandards, negative and positive VV or PV values corresponded to contralesional (i.e., counter-\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nclockwise)  and  ipsilesional  (i.e.,  clockwise)  orientations,  respectively.

In  contrast,  the  three\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 4 shows that graphomotor z-scores were moderately correlated with transmodal vertical\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nestimates (rs = .46, p < 10-4) and global spatial neglect scores (rs = -.36, p < .01), without significant\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndifference between these two correlations (Pearson and Filon’s z test on absolute values, z = 0.85,\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOverall, these results showed the importance of spatial deficits, tilted verticality representation\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nand spatial neglect, in contralesional graphomotor tilts of individuals with RHS.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOur main objective was to test  whether contralesional tilts of writing  and drawing after an RHS\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwere associated with a tilted verticality representation, transposed to the top/bottom axis of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsheet of paper. For this aim, individuals with a subacute RHS were asked to write three lines and\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto draw  the Gainotti  Figure in the framework  of clinical  routine  practice. Two  reliable criteria of\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngraphomotor orientation were extracted: the three lines for the writing, and the two roof lines for\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe drawing. Our results reveal that tilted writing and drawing orientations were primary correlated\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto  an  impaired  verticality  representation,  and  secondary  correlated  to  spatial  neglect  severity.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCongruently, individuals with a contralesional writing and drawing tilt differed from others by more\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsevere and frequent contralesional VV and PV tilts, greater lateropulsion, and more severe spatial\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nneglect. These findings support the hypothesis that spatial cognition deficits, and notably tilts in\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nverticality  representation,  may  manifest  in  the  orientation  of  graphomotor  productions  after  an\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAltogether, our results show that contralesional graphomotor tilts were associated to all measures\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof verticality estimates (visual, postural, and transmodal). This suggests that writing and drawing\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntilts are not related to a specific graviceptive modality (vestibular or somaesthetic) but rather to a\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nhigher-order representation of verticality. Of note, the VV mainly tests the processing of gravity-\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrelated vestibular information (conveyed by the otolith organs; [27,40]), whereas the PV mainly\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntests  the  processing  of  gravity-related  somesthetic  information  (conveyed  by  proprioceptive,\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntactile, and visceral receptors; [41,42]). These two sources of information would be integrated into\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand pondered by the multisensory thalamo-vestibular network to represent the vertical [26,43,44].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe RHS could disturb these multisensory mechanisms, leading to abnormal contralesional tilts\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nnot only in VV and PV estimates, but also in graphomotor tasks involving an implicit representation\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof  the  “upright”.  Of  interest,  very  severe  tilts  in  verticality  representation  might  even  be  able to\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmanifest in various graphomotor tasks. Indeed, the most severe tilts of VV and VP were found in\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nindividuals having both writing and drawing tilts, two tasks that yet differ in terms of instructions,\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIs  the  association  between  graphomotor  tilts  and  tilted  verticality  representation  causal?\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nis used for various sensorimotor tasks such as body orientation, catching, grasping, or pointing\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmovements  (for  recent  reviews  see  [45,46]).  The  brain  might  also  use  a  representation  of\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nverticality during the execution of graphomotor tasks involving spatial orientation skills in 2D. This\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nview  is  supported  by  Jolly  et  al.  (2020),  who  recently  showed  that  a  short-term  modulation  of\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nverticality perception in the patient JW (PV, -10° before vs 0.5° after) was congruently associated\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nwith a significant diminution of his writing tilts (-10° before vs. -6° after).\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn the current series, the association between verticality estimates and graphomotor tilts was\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nless strong than that reported by Jolly et al. (2020) in their case-study (i.e., moderate vs. strong\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\neffect sizes). This finding may be explained first by the multi-determined nature of graphomotor\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbehaviors.  Writing  and  drawing  involve  a  large  range  of  cognitive  operations,  encompassing\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nspatial  attention,  spatial  remapping,  coordinate  transformation,  object  recognition,  executive\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfunctions,  and motor  control [1–3,6]. The  disruption  of  one of these mechanisms  after  an  RHS\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncould induce graphomotor tilts on their own, independent of an impaired verticality representation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis could be notably the case in individuals showing a dissociation between writing and drawing\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntilts (about 30%). For example, an impaired spatial remapping might disturb writing and drawing\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\norientations in a non-systematic way, depending on the trajectory of the saccadic eye movements.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe Gainotti task requires numerous up and down saccades between the model and the drawing\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nspace, whereas the writing task requires horizontal saccades between the letters and words. An\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimpaired motor control might also influence the writing and drawing in different ways, as these\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntasks  require  different  motor  planification  and  motor  commands.  Second,  the  moderate  effect\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsizes we observed could also be explained by the use of the paper sheet’s borders, or drawing\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmodel, as a visual allocentric frame of reference. Indeed, individuals with an impaired integration\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof gravity-related  vestibular  or  somaesthetic  cues  showed  increased reliance on  visual  cues to\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nestimate verticality [47,48]. Despite a severe tilt in verticality representation, individuals with  an\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nRHS using this allocentric strategy might compensate for their deficit in such conditions and exhibit\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nupright graphomotor orientations. This allocentric strategy could have been used especially in the\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nContrary  to  our  expectations,  we  found  that  graphomotor  tilts  were  also  moderately  related  to\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nspatial  neglect  severity  and frequency.  Although  spatial  neglect  is  an  important  determinant  of\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmany signs of spatial dysgraphia or drawing errors [1,4,6], how it would induce graphomotor tilts\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe more plausible interpretation is that the association between graphomotor tilts and spatial\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nneglect is mediated by concomitant tilts in verticality representation. Indeed, clinical studies have\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nincreasingly suggested that an impaired representation of verticality is a key component of spatial\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nneglect [17,19,21,49], and it has been recently shown that transmodal (visual and postural) vertical\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntilts  [19]  and  lateropulsion  [17]  constituted  very  strong  proxy  of  spatial  neglect.  This  mediation\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nhypothesis is also supported by a recent case study, reporting a dissociated recovery between\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nMight  spatial  neglect  induce  graphomotor  tilts  because  of  a  distortion  between  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrepresentation  of  the  left  and  right  hemispaces?  A  possible  mechanism  could  involve  the  line\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbreaking, more and more shifted to the right in individuals with spatial neglect [1,4], which results\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin a left margin tilt. If the orthogonality between the margin (vertical coordinate) and writing lines\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(horizontal  coordinate)  is  respected  in  these  individuals  [5,21],  this  line  breaking  should  also\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nindirectly tilt the writing lines upward. But such a mechanism cannot explain the tilts of the drawing\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrooflines. Thus, our data and the recent literature rather suggest that spatial neglect plays a role\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn individuals showing a contralesional tilt in both writing and drawing tasks, VV and VP tilts were\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npeculiarly  frequent  (>  80%)  and  severe  (median  tilt  >  -7°),  and  associated  with  a  severe\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlateropulsion (median SCP = 3). Therefore, these graphomotor tilts, which are easy to search early\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\neven in patients with a severe stroke and bedridden, should be more systematically detected in\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nMore indirectly, our results might also suggest a role of spatial cognition disorders in 3D on\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nnon-lateralized visuo-constructive deficits, which remain to be better understood. We speculate\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthat the combination of and impaired verticality representation and a representational distortion\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\non  the  left-right  axis  (spatial  neglect),  possibly  with  an  impaired  motor  control,  might  alter\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nassembling segments to draw or build figures in 2D and 3D, leading to the so-called constructional\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nA  first  limitation  is  the  observational  nature  of  the  writing  and  drawing  data  collected  from  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDOBRAS cohort. Hence, we could not verify that the sheet of paper was always perfectly aligned\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwith the trunk and head of the participant,  although neuropsychologists carefully  monitored the\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npositions of the sheet and the patient’s body. Likewise, we could not investigate other potential\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmechanisms  of  graphomotor  tilts,  such  as  feedback-related  errors  [6,7]  and  impaired  spatial\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nremapping [9,12,50], which still needs to be studied. Second, we did not control for the potential\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\neffect of ocular torsion on graphomotor tilts, although ocular torsion is infrequent after hemispheric\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstroke [27] and should not alter our findings. Finally, we did not investigate the representation of\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n“horizontality”,  which  is  known  to  be,  as  with  VV,  tilted  counterclockwise  after  stroke  [21].\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNevertheless,  clinical  and  experimental  studies  suggest  that  the  VV  and  visual  horizontal  are\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOur study supports the hypothesis that contralesional tilts of writing and drawing after RHS are\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrelated to  a tilted representation of  verticality  transposed to the top/bottom  axis  of the  sheet  of\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npaper.  This  may  explain  why  these  graphomotor  tilts  are  observed  in  individuals  with  spatial\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nneglect,  who  are  often  subject to  a wrong representation  of  verticality. These graphomotor tilts\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nshould  be  more  systematically  searched,  which  can  be  done  early  after  the  stroke,  even  in\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbedridden individuals having a severe RHS.

Handwriting  and  drawing  orientations  were  measured  from  the  writing  of  three  lines  and  the   drawing  of the Gainotti Figure  (house  roof  lines).  Verticality  perception  was measured  with  the   visual (VV) and postural (PV) verticals. Severity of extra-body (EBN) and body (BN) neglect were   We analyzed data of 133 individuals: 64 healthy individuals (median age 63 years) and 69 with a   subacute  RHS  (median age  68  years). With  respect to  normal cut-offs  (writing  -5.4°;  drawing -   8.1°),  26/69  (38%)  individuals  with  RHS  showed  at  least  one  graphomotor  tilt  (median[IQR]  of   writing  tilt:  -6.8°[-9.7;-1.7];  drawing  tilt:  -10.9°[-17.6;-6.4]).  Compared  to  individuals  without   graphomotor tilts, those having both writing and drawing tilts showed greater contralesional tilts in   verticality  perception  (VV:  -1.4°[-4;0.6]  vs  -7.9°[-11.5;-7.5];  PV:  -1°[-2.4;0.2]  vs  -8°[-9;-5.4],  Ps   ≤.001) and more severe spatial neglect (EBN: 4.2[1.8;9.3] vs 16.6[10.2;20.4]; BN: 22.7[17;28.2]   vs 37.8[35.9;39.7], Ps ≤.01). Composite graphomotor z-scores on writing and drawing correlated   both with verticality estimates (VV+PV, rs=.46, p <10-4) and spatial neglect scores (EBN+BN, rs=-   Contralesional tilts of writing and drawing after RHS are primary related to a tilted representation   of  verticality,  and  secondary  related  to  spatial  neglect.  They  are  easy  to  detect  and  could  be   considered as a first step to perform early, before conventional tests of verticality perception.   Manifestations of spatial dysgraphia and drawing errors after right hemispheric stroke (RHS) have   revealed  the  contribution  of  the  right  hemisphere  to  the  spatial  organization  of  graphomotor   behaviors, such as handwriting and drawing [1–6]. Spatial dysgraphia refers to various handwriting   difficulties distorting the spatial layout of writing. It encompasses letter or word omission/iteration,   overwriting,  writing  only  in  the  right  margin,  and  sloping  lines  [1,4,6,7].  Spatial  dysgraphia  has   been mainly associated with damage to the right parietal lobe [1,4,5], as well as to subcortical grey   and white matters [8,9]. Drawing errors typically comprise line omission/iteration, perspective loss   or abnormal location, wrong proportions, and tilted orientation [2,3,6]. This constructional disorder   has been frequently associated with damage to the right temporo-parietal lobes and adjacent white   The brain areas involved in spatial dysgraphia and drawing errors explain why pioneer clinical   observations reported a strong association between these graphomotor errors and spatial neglect   [3,4,6,14]. This association is causal for lateralized graphomotor errors such as left omissions and   right gradient characterizing spatial neglect [15]. In contrast, spatial neglect does not easily explain   — and was found dissociated from — non-lateralized errors such as letter duplication in the writing   (e.g., [7]) or altered spatial relations in the drawing (e.g., [3]). These graphomotor errors could be   rather  explained  by  impaired  visual/kinaesthetic  feedbacks  [6,7]  or  impaired  spatial  remapping   But,  none  of  the  above-mentioned  mechanisms  hold  for  the  counterclockwise  tilts  of   graphomotor productions, which are frequent and remain to be explained. We hypothesized that   they might result from a contralesional tilt in the representation of the vertical, transposed to the   sheet  of  paper  referring  to  the  top  and  bottom.  A  recent  single  case  study  [5]  supports  this   hypothesis, that we tested here, in a substantial series of right-handed individuals examined at   the early subacute stage after an RHS. We investigated the associations between contralesional   graphomotor tilts, verticality estimates, and other relevant clinical deficits such as spatial neglect.   Data and analysis codes of this study are available on reasonable request from the corresponding   This study was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and regulatory rules for   human research in France. It was registered at the national committee for informatics and freedom   (Commission Internationale Informatique et Liberté, no. 2014874 v1). All individuals were informed   orally and in writing about the study and gave their informed consent. All participants, controls and   Writing  and  drawing  productions  of  individuals  with  RHS  were  analyzed  from  data  of  the   DOBRAS cohort (Determinants of Balance Recovery After Stroke), approved by our institutional   review  board  (CHU  Grenoble  Alpes),  which  validated  the  ClinicalTrials.gov  registration   (NCT03203109). According to French law, eligible individuals were informed about the DOBRAS   study (orally and in writing) and use of their data; those who did not want to participate signed an   opposition  form.  Studies  of  the  DOBRAS  cohort  focus  on  the  recovery  of  balance  and  gait   disorders after a first-ever hemispheric stroke, particularly in relation to spatial cognition deficits,   such  as  impaired  verticality  perception  and  spatial  neglect  (for  the  first  results,  see  [17–19]).   Writing and drawing tasks were part of the routine assessment of spatial neglect.   The  recruitment  of  healthy  controls,  selected  to  be  matched  to  individuals  with  RHS,  was   approved  by  the  ethical  review  board  of  Grenoble-Alpes  University  (CERGA-2019–04–09–1).   They were recruited from the relatives of authors and from the relatives of patients hospitalized in   Their writing and drawing data have partly been reported in a previous methodological study   intending to identify reliable criteria to measure writing and drawing orientations [20]. The goal of   the  present  study  was  to  understand  graphomotor  tilts  after  RHS,  by  identifying  their  clinical   We  extracted  from  the  DOBRAS  database  only  the  observations  for  right-handed  individuals   (Edinburgh  inventory  score  ≥  0.4)  with  a  first-ever  RHS,  to  focus  on  individuals  potentially   presenting  spatial  representation  disorders,  spatial  dysgraphia,  and  drawing  errors  [3,6,21].  All   individuals were able to write and draw with their non-paretic right upper limb. Among the three   evaluations performed at 30, 60, and 90 days (D30, D60, D90) after the RHS, we selected the   earliest  and  most  complete  evaluation  in  terms  of  writing,  drawing,  and  other  spatial  cognition   Exclusion  criteria  common  to  all  DOBRAS  studies  were  recurrent  or  complicated  stroke,   unstable medical condition, previous disability interfering with balance and verticality perception,   psychiatric problems, or dementia (e.g., [18]). Additional exclusion criteria for this ancillary study   were severe comprehensive impairment (due to aphasia, even if rare after RHS in right-handers),   not French-speaking (as a native language), limb apraxia (Test of Upper Limb Apraxia score < 9;   [22]), and altered ability to remain seated (Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke score < 8; [23];   We planned to recruit about 60 individuals with RHS to build multivariate models and test the   effects  of  impaired  verticality  perception  and  spatial  neglect  on  graphomotor  tilts  against  each   Healthy controls were recruited to be matched to the individuals with RHS in manual laterality   (right-handers), age, sex ratio, and education level (1 = primary school certificate, 2 = ninth-grade   certificate [“brevet”], 3 = bachelor’s degree). They were asked about their medical history, had to   not have neurological disorders, and had to have preserved abilities to draw and write legibly. No   For writing, the material was the French battery for neglect assessment (Batterie d’évaluation de   la négligence; [24]; see Fig. 2a). Individuals were asked to manually write personal details on three   lines  on  the  blank  sheet  of  paper  in  portrait  format.  For  drawing,  the  material  was the  Gainotti   Figure, representing a landscape with four trees and one house oriented vertically and horizontally   [25]; see Fig. 2b). The Gainotti Figure was printed on the top of a page in landscape format, and   individuals were instructed to manually copy it just below. For both tasks, the neuropsychologist   checked that the sheet of paper was centered on the individual’s trunk but never gave instructions   To  measure  writing  and  drawing  orientation  criteria,  all  graphomotor  productions  were  first   digitized.  Then,  a  home-made  electronic  protractor  was  used  to  compute  the  orientation  of   segments  (e.g.,  the  drawing  of  one  of  the  house  roof  lines)  defined  from  landmarks  (e.g.,   extremities of the drawn segment) positioned by the operator (RL). The accuracy was set to 0.1°.   RL was blinded to data from tests of verticality perception and spatial neglect. More details  are   given  in our  recent methodological  paper  [21],  which  showed  that  among  various graphomotor   criteria tested, the two best were the mean tilt from the horizontal of the three written lines (“writing   orientation”, Fig. 2a) and of the two drawn roof lines of the house (“drawing orientation”, Fig. 2b).   These two graphomotor criteria have excellent clinimetric properties and are the most suited to   detect and quantify contralesional (i.e., counter-clockwise) tilts in individuals with a RHS [20]. Of   note,  the  “horizontal”  orientation  refers  here  to  the  width  of  the  sheet  of  paper.  By  convention,   For both writing and drawing criteria, we determined the thresholds of abnormal contralesional   tilt from data distribution (mean ± 2 SD) obtained in the 64 healthy controls. These distributions   were  approximatively  Gaussian  according  to  visual  inspection  and  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  tests   (writing: p = .64; drawing: p = .10). These thresholds were [-5.4°; 1.7°] for the written lines and [-   8.1°; 2.2°] for the drawn roof lines. With regards to ipsilesional graphomotor tilts, we found that   only 2/69 (3%) individuals had a writing tilt > 1.7° (of a small magnitude: 3.1° and 3.4°) and 0/69   had  a  drawing  tilt  >  2.2°.  These  two  individuals  with  a  marginal  ipsilesional  writing  tilt  (without   contralesional drawing tilt) had normal VV (-0.7°, -1.8°) and normal/quasi-normal PV (1°, -2.8°),   and no spatial neglect. Because we planned to analyze whether contralesional graphomotor tilts   were related to contralesional VV/PV tilts, we pooled these two individuals with those who had a   normal  graphomotor  orientation,  and  a  similar  clinical  profile  without  bias  in  verticality   We also computed a composite “graphomotor z-score” to serve as a robust index of the global   magnitude of writing and drawing tilts in individuals with RHS. For this, their writing and drawing   orientations  were  each  z-scored  from  the  means  and  standard  deviations  obtained  in  healthy   The  representation  of  verticality  was  assessed  with  two  well-validated  measures,  the  visual   vertical (VV) and postural vertical (PV), described in detail elsewhere [26].   VV was measured in darkness by binocular visual adjustment of the orientation of a luminous   line (visual angle = 5.7° x 0.1°) presented on a computer screen at eye level, about 1.5 m from   the  nasion.  In  case  of  hemianopia, the  computer  screen was  adequately  translated toward  the   non-hemianopic side. Individuals were seated with their head and trunk maintained upright and   were  asked  to  adjust  the  line  to  the  vertical  by  giving  verbal  instructions  to  the  examiner.  The   starting orientation of the line, randomly ranging from ± 5° to ± 30°, was balanced to the right or   PV  was  assessed  in  darkness  with  the  wheel  test  (see  [26]).  Individuals  were  seated,   restrained in a wheel-like device that was slowly and manually turned by the examiner and were   asked to adjust their body to the vertical by giving verbal instructions to the examiner. The starting   orientation of their body, ranging from ±15° to ±45°, was balanced to the right or left following a   For both tasks, individuals performed 10 trials. All measures started after 2 min of darkness.   The  examiner  never  gave  a  time  limit  or  feedback.  Data  from  all  10  trials  were  averaged  to   calculate individual mean VV and PV orientations. In addition, we calculated “transmodal” vertical   estimates  (means  of  VV  and  PV)  to  get  a  unique  measure  of  verticality  representation  (i.e.,   independent from a specific vestibular or somaesthetic modality of gravity sensing). According to   standards, negative and positive VV or PV values corresponded to contralesional (i.e., counter-   clockwise)  and  ipsilesional  (i.e.,  clockwise)  orientations,  respectively.  VV  and  PV  tilts  were   diagnosed according to well-established ranges of normality (-2.5 to 2.5°; [26,27]).   Extra-body neglect (EBN) and body neglect (BN) were evaluated by trained neuropsychologists   and occupational  therapists  with  a battery  of  eight  well-validated  tests routinely  used in clinical   practice [24]. EBN was evaluated with (1) the Bells cancellation test [28], (2) the overlapping figure   test [29], (3) the reading test [24], and (4) four EBN items of the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS;   [30]).  BN  was  evaluated  with (5)  the  Bisiach test  [31],  (6)  the  Fluff test [32],  (7) the  Comb  and   Razor test [33,34], and (8) four BN items of the CBS [30]. Participants completed these tests with   their sound right upper limb (see [18,19] for more details about these eight tests).   Spatial neglect was diagnosed from at least two abnormal test results, whatever the spatial   neglect domain. We also evaluated EBN and BN severities by calculating composite scores. For   this, raw scores for all eight neglect tests were converted to percentages based on their respective   ranges (0% = no neglect, 100% = maximal neglect). These percentages were then averaged to   calculate EBN and BN scores, as well as a “global” spatial neglect score (mean of EBN and BN   scores). More details about these composite scores are provided in Appendix A.   Gait  and  disability  were  evaluated  with  the  modified  Fugl-Meyer  Assessment  gait  score  [35],   ranging  from  0  arbitrary  unit  (a.u.)  =  no  gait,  to  6  a.u.  (=  normal  gait)  and  the  Functional   Independence Measure [36], ranging from 18 a.u. (= very severe disability, a.u.) to 126 a.u. (=   total independence). Lateropulsion, which refers to an abnormal postural behavior against gravity,   was evaluated with the Scale for Contraversive Pushing (SCP; [37]), ranging from 0 a.u. (= upright   body  orientation,  a.u.)  to  6  a.u.  (=  active  pushing  of  the  body  toward  the  contralesional  side).   Lateropulsion was considered moderate or severe with an SCP score > 0.5 [18, 27]. These three   scales  are  detailed  in  previous  DOBRAS  reports  (e.g.,[18,26]).  Hemianopia  was  manually   Descriptive  statistics  are  first  presented  for  each  graphomotor  criterion,  both  for  orientation   magnitude  and  prevalence  of  abnormal  tilt.  Data  were  analyzed  with  non-parametric  tests,  as   residual plots from parametric tests revealed assumption violations and outlying data.   To identify the main determinants of contralesional graphomotor orientation, we first compared   the clinical profile of three groups of individuals with RHS: (1) those having normal graphomotor   orientation or light ipsilesional tilt, (2) those having a contralesional writing or drawing tilt, (3) those   having both contralesional writing and drawing tilts. Differences between groups were tested with   Kruskal-Wallis (omnibus) tests for continuous measures, and with chi-squared tests for categorical   Then, we conducted two-tailed Spearman correlations and Pearson and Filon’ z tests to test   whether the graphomotor z-scores were more associated with the transmodal vertical estimates   (mean of VV and PV) than with the global spatial neglect scores (mean of EBN and BN).   Continuous  data  are  presented  as  median  [Q1;  Q3]  and  categorical  data  as  number  (%).   Standardized effect sizes were calculated by using the rs (rho) value of the Spearman test, the √ƞ²   value of the Kruskal-Wallis test, the r value of the Mann-Whitney test, and the Cramer’s w of the   chi-squared  test.  Effect  sizes  >  0.1,  0.3,  or  0.5  were  considered  small,  medium,  or  large,   respectively [38]. The significance level was set at p < .05 and Bonferroni-corrected when needed.   A  total  of  133  individuals  took  part  in  this  study  (see  flowchart  in  Fig.  1):  69  with  RHS  and  64   healthy controls, matched in age (median 68 years [62; 73] vs 63 years [59; 71]; Mann-Whitney,   p = .24, r = 0.10) and sex ratio (n = 43/69 [62%] vs 35/64 [55%] males; χ2, p = .47, w = 0.06). With   regards to education levels, no difference was found between individuals with RHS and healthy   controls (χ2, p = .10, w = 0.19): level 1, 27/69 [39%] vs 14/64 [22%]; level 2, 18 [26%] vs 21 [33%];   level 3, 24 [35%] vs 29 [45%]). Clinical data were collected mostly at D30 (n = 48, 70%), sometimes   at D60 (n = 13, 19%), and more rarely at  D90 (n = 8, 12%). The stroke was mainly a cerebral   infarct (n = 61, 88%). The individual disability was moderate, with a median FIM score of 102 [75;   114];  the  median  mFMA  gait  score  was  5  [2;  6],  indicating  that  half  was  able  to  walk  without   technical aid; the median SCP score was 0.25 [0; 1.5], indicating that most of them were either   upright or showed mild lateral body tilt with respect from gravity.   Only 9/4200 (0.21 %) data points were missing in the whole dataset. For clinical deficits, 3 (4%)   PV tests and 2 (3%) VV tests were missing because of participant uneasiness or dizziness in the   dark. Two (3%) other PV tests were missing because of technical problems or the inability of a   participant to sit in the device because of a pelvic fracture. For the drawing test, roof lines were   not drawn by 2 (3%) individuals. Data imputation was not required given these few missing data.   Figures  3a  and  3b  present  data  distribution  for  each  graphomotor  criterion.  Orientations  were   mostly contralesional for both criteria: -1.8° [-4.5; -0.6] for the writing and -4.4° [-8.3; -2.5] for the   drawing.  The  frequency  of  contralesional  (abnormal)  tilts  were  comparable  for  the  writing  (n  =   15/69, 22%) and the drawing (n = 18/69, 26%). Overall, 43/69 (62%) individuals did not show any   contralesional graphomotor  tilt,  19/69 (28%)  individuals  showed  a contralesional  tilt for  at  least   one  criterion  (writing  tilt  =  -2.6°  [-8;  -1.1];  drawing  tilt  =  -9.6°  [-15.1;  -4.6]),  and  7/69  (10%)  a   contralesional tilt bearing on both criteria (writing tilt = -9.5° [-13.1; -7.4]; drawing tilt = -17.6° [-   23.7;  -11.2]).  Writing  and  drawing  orientations  were  nonetheless  not  significantly  correlated   (Spearman test, rS = .20, p = .10). As highlighted in Fig. 3, there were cases of dissociations: 8/69   (12%) individuals showed an isolated contralesional writing tilt, whereas 13/69 (19%) showed an   Figure 3c shows data distribution for the graphomotor z-scores, representing the mean severity   of writing and drawing tilts. Important variations were noted: range = -8.3 to 1.5 SD, median = -0.4   For  VV,  abnormal  contralesional  tilts  were found in  34/67 (51%)  individuals. In  others,  VV  was   either  normal  in 25/67 (37%)  individuals  or  more  rarely  subjected  to a  light  ipsilesional  tilt  (n =   8/67,  12%).  For  PV,  abnormal  tilts  were  found  in  27/64  (42%)  individuals,  always  toward  the   contralesional  side,  otherwise was normal  in 37/64  (58%).  Contralesional  tilts  were transmodal   (VV  and  PV)  in  20/64  (31%)  individuals.  See  Appendix  B  for  details  on  associations  and   Spatial  neglect  was diagnosed  in  41/69 (59%)  individuals,  with  29  (42%)  individuals  having   EBN, 36 (52%) having BN, and 24 (35%) having both. Left hemianopia was diagnosed in 23/69   Table  1  shows  the  clinical  profile  of  individuals  with  RHS  according  to  their  graphomotor   orientations  (normal  graphomotor  orientation  or  light  ipsilesional  tilt  [n  =  43/69,  62%],   contralesional writing or drawing tilt [n = 19, 28%], contralesional writing and drawing tilts [n = 7,   10%]). As for verticality estimates, the severity and frequency of contralesional VV and PV tilts   gradually  increased  with  the  number  of  contralesional  graphomotor  tilts  (all  p-values  ≤  .01,   moderate effect sizes). Whereas VV and PV estimates were in normal ranges (-2.5 to +2.5°) in   individuals without graphomotor tilts, they raised to -8° (about 6 SD) in individuals with writing and   drawing tilts. These latter had 2 to 4 times more tilts in verticality perception. Congruently, they   also showed greater lateropulsion. The severity and frequency of spatial neglect (EBN and BN)   also increased with the number of contralesional graphomotor tilts. This was specially the case for   EBN (p-values ≤ .01, moderate effect sizes), found in 28% of individuals without graphomotor tilts,   and  in  100%  of  individuals  with  writing  and  drawing  tilts  (Table  1).  In  contrast,  the  three   Figure 4 shows that graphomotor z-scores were moderately correlated with transmodal vertical   estimates (rs = .46, p < 10-4) and global spatial neglect scores (rs = -.36, p < .01), without significant   difference between these two correlations (Pearson and Filon’s z test on absolute values, z = 0.85,   Overall, these results showed the importance of spatial deficits, tilted verticality representation   and spatial neglect, in contralesional graphomotor tilts of individuals with RHS.   Our main objective was to test  whether contralesional tilts of writing  and drawing after an RHS   were associated with a tilted verticality representation, transposed to the top/bottom axis of the   sheet of paper. For this aim, individuals with a subacute RHS were asked to write three lines and   to draw  the Gainotti  Figure in the framework  of clinical  routine  practice. Two  reliable criteria of   graphomotor orientation were extracted: the three lines for the writing, and the two roof lines for   the drawing. Our results reveal that tilted writing and drawing orientations were primary correlated   to  an  impaired  verticality  representation,  and  secondary  correlated  to  spatial  neglect  severity.   Congruently, individuals with a contralesional writing and drawing tilt differed from others by more   severe and frequent contralesional VV and PV tilts, greater lateropulsion, and more severe spatial   neglect. These findings support the hypothesis that spatial cognition deficits, and notably tilts in   verticality  representation,  may  manifest  in  the  orientation  of  graphomotor  productions  after  an   Altogether, our results show that contralesional graphomotor tilts were associated to all measures   of verticality estimates (visual, postural, and transmodal). This suggests that writing and drawing   tilts are not related to a specific graviceptive modality (vestibular or somaesthetic) but rather to a   higher-order representation of verticality. Of note, the VV mainly tests the processing of gravity-   related vestibular information (conveyed by the otolith organs; [27,40]), whereas the PV mainly   tests  the  processing  of  gravity-related  somesthetic  information  (conveyed  by  proprioceptive,   tactile, and visceral receptors; [41,42]). These two sources of information would be integrated into   and pondered by the multisensory thalamo-vestibular network to represent the vertical [26,43,44].   The RHS could disturb these multisensory mechanisms, leading to abnormal contralesional tilts   not only in VV and PV estimates, but also in graphomotor tasks involving an implicit representation   of  the  “upright”.  Of  interest,  very  severe  tilts  in  verticality  representation  might  even  be  able to   manifest in various graphomotor tasks. Indeed, the most severe tilts of VV and VP were found in   individuals having both writing and drawing tilts, two tasks that yet differ in terms of instructions,   Is  the  association  between  graphomotor  tilts  and  tilted  verticality  representation  causal?   is used for various sensorimotor tasks such as body orientation, catching, grasping, or pointing   movements  (for  recent  reviews  see  [45,46]).  The  brain  might  also  use  a  representation  of   verticality during the execution of graphomotor tasks involving spatial orientation skills in 2D. This   view  is  supported  by  Jolly  et  al.  (2020),  who  recently  showed  that  a  short-term  modulation  of   verticality perception in the patient JW (PV, -10° before vs 0.5° after) was congruently associated   with a significant diminution of his writing tilts (-10° before vs. -6° after).   In the current series, the association between verticality estimates and graphomotor tilts was   less strong than that reported by Jolly et al. (2020) in their case-study (i.e., moderate vs. strong   effect sizes). This finding may be explained first by the multi-determined nature of graphomotor   behaviors.  Writing  and  drawing  involve  a  large  range  of  cognitive  operations,  encompassing   spatial  attention,  spatial  remapping,  coordinate  transformation,  object  recognition,  executive   functions,  and motor  control [1–3,6]. The  disruption  of  one of these mechanisms  after  an  RHS   could induce graphomotor tilts on their own, independent of an impaired verticality representation.   This could be notably the case in individuals showing a dissociation between writing and drawing   tilts (about 30%). For example, an impaired spatial remapping might disturb writing and drawing   orientations in a non-systematic way, depending on the trajectory of the saccadic eye movements.   The Gainotti task requires numerous up and down saccades between the model and the drawing   space, whereas the writing task requires horizontal saccades between the letters and words. An   impaired motor control might also influence the writing and drawing in different ways, as these   tasks  require  different  motor  planification  and  motor  commands.  Second,  the  moderate  effect   sizes we observed could also be explained by the use of the paper sheet’s borders, or drawing   model, as a visual allocentric frame of reference. Indeed, individuals with an impaired integration   of gravity-related  vestibular  or  somaesthetic  cues  showed  increased reliance on  visual  cues to   estimate verticality [47,48]. Despite a severe tilt in verticality representation, individuals with  an   RHS using this allocentric strategy might compensate for their deficit in such conditions and exhibit   upright graphomotor orientations. This allocentric strategy could have been used especially in the   Contrary  to  our  expectations,  we  found  that  graphomotor  tilts  were  also  moderately  related  to   spatial  neglect  severity  and frequency.  Although  spatial  neglect  is  an  important  determinant  of   many signs of spatial dysgraphia or drawing errors [1,4,6], how it would induce graphomotor tilts   The more plausible interpretation is that the association between graphomotor tilts and spatial   neglect is mediated by concomitant tilts in verticality representation. Indeed, clinical studies have   increasingly suggested that an impaired representation of verticality is a key component of spatial   neglect [17,19,21,49], and it has been recently shown that transmodal (visual and postural) vertical   tilts  [19]  and  lateropulsion  [17]  constituted  very  strong  proxy  of  spatial  neglect.  This  mediation   hypothesis is also supported by a recent case study, reporting a dissociated recovery between   Might  spatial  neglect  induce  graphomotor  tilts  because  of  a  distortion  between  the   representation  of  the  left  and  right  hemispaces?  A  possible  mechanism  could  involve  the  line   breaking, more and more shifted to the right in individuals with spatial neglect [1,4], which results   in a left margin tilt. If the orthogonality between the margin (vertical coordinate) and writing lines   (horizontal  coordinate)  is  respected  in  these  individuals  [5,21],  this  line  breaking  should  also   indirectly tilt the writing lines upward. But such a mechanism cannot explain the tilts of the drawing   rooflines. Thus, our data and the recent literature rather suggest that spatial neglect plays a role   In individuals showing a contralesional tilt in both writing and drawing tasks, VV and VP tilts were   peculiarly  frequent  (>  80%)  and  severe  (median  tilt  >  -7°),  and  associated  with  a  severe   lateropulsion (median SCP = 3). Therefore, these graphomotor tilts, which are easy to search early   even in patients with a severe stroke and bedridden, should be more systematically detected in   More indirectly, our results might also suggest a role of spatial cognition disorders in 3D on   non-lateralized visuo-constructive deficits, which remain to be better understood. We speculate   that the combination of and impaired verticality representation and a representational distortion   on  the  left-right  axis  (spatial  neglect),  possibly  with  an  impaired  motor  control,  might  alter   assembling segments to draw or build figures in 2D and 3D, leading to the so-called constructional   A  first  limitation  is  the  observational  nature  of  the  writing  and  drawing  data  collected  from  the   DOBRAS cohort. Hence, we could not verify that the sheet of paper was always perfectly aligned   with the trunk and head of the participant,  although neuropsychologists carefully  monitored the   positions of the sheet and the patient’s body. Likewise, we could not investigate other potential   mechanisms  of  graphomotor  tilts,  such  as  feedback-related  errors  [6,7]  and  impaired  spatial   remapping [9,12,50], which still needs to be studied. Second, we did not control for the potential   effect of ocular torsion on graphomotor tilts, although ocular torsion is infrequent after hemispheric   stroke [27] and should not alter our findings. Finally, we did not investigate the representation of   “horizontality”,  which  is  known  to  be,  as  with  VV,  tilted  counterclockwise  after  stroke  [21].   Nevertheless,  clinical  and  experimental  studies  suggest  that  the  VV  and  visual  horizontal  are   Our study supports the hypothesis that contralesional tilts of writing and drawing after RHS are   related to  a tilted representation of  verticality  transposed to the top/bottom  axis  of the  sheet  of   paper.  This  may  explain  why  these  graphomotor  tilts  are  observed  in  individuals  with  spatial   neglect,  who  are  often  subject to  a wrong representation  of  verticality. These graphomotor tilts   should  be  more  systematically  searched,  which  can  be  done  early  after  the  stroke,  even  in   bedridden individuals having a severe RHS.

         "Sleep is an evolutionarily ancient and nearly universal behavior throughout the animal kingdom. Multiple cave-dwelling populations of the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have converged on sleep loss compared to river-dwelling surface fish. However, sleep has not been assessed in the vast majority of the 34 known A. mexicanus cave populations. Moreover, whether cavefish sleep less than surface individuals in their natural habitats is currently unknown. Analyzing the distribution of sleep loss and its relationship with other regressive traits in a phylogenetic framework is critical to inform the selective pressures across the different lineages. We measured sleep and locomotor activity in 15 distinct populations of A. mexicanus, including lineages that are broadly representative of the 34 cavefish populations identified to date. Sleep was drastically reduced in all cave and hybrid populations that were tested. A subset of caves contain hybrid populations of A. mexicanus, which show a broad range of eye and pigmentation phenotypes, yet have evolved near-complete loss of sleep. Mapping behavioral changes onto the phylogeny of A. mexicanus populations revealed that loss of sleep and elevated locomotor activity have evolved at least three times. Analysis of sleep in the wild confirms that the sleep loss phenotype observed in lab-reared fish is also present in the natural environment. Together, these findings reveal deep evolutionary convergence on sleep loss in cavefish and provide evidence for sleep loss as a primary trait contributing to cave adaptation.",

However, the advent of nanotechnology\nmade it possible to engineer nanostructures and fabricate arrays of subwavelength\nholes in metals through focused ion beam milling or electron beam lithography tech-\nniques. Nanoscale engineering brought new insights into optical phenomena such as\ndiffraction, transmission, reflection, and scattering of light from nanostructures and\ninstigated the fields of subwavelength optics and nanophotonics. The advancements\nin nano-optics revolutionized optical sensing and nanoscale imaging techniques and\nuncovered various fascinating phenomena of light at the nanoscale under light-matter\ninteraction. Among them was the extraordinary optical transmission (EOT).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWhen light strikes an optically thick metal film perforated with periodic arrays\nof subwavelength holes, more light transmits from the metal than impinges on it,\nknown as EOT. In 1998, Ebbesen and his co-workers reported this unusual transmission\nfrom Ag film, perforated with nanoholes, with transmission efficiency exceeding unity\n[2]. To fabricate a hole array structure in Ag metal, the focused ion beam (FIB)\nwas utilized, an image of such a structure is shown in Fig.1(b), and the zero-order\ntransmission spectrum was obtained with a spectrophotometer using incoherent light\nsources [see Fig.1(a)]. Through this experiment, Ebbesen observed that EOT is only\npossible when (i) a TM polarized light is incident perpendicular to the metal film,\n(ii) the hole diameter is less than the wavelength of the incident light, and (iii) the\nperiodicity of the hole arrays is resonant with transmission wavelength, (iv) solely\nmetal film is utilized instead of semiconductor material such as Ge film [3, 4]. Under\nthese conditions, it was found that the transmission was not only higher than the light\nimpinging on the structure, but it also breached the transmission limit defined by\nBethe. In addition, transmission efficiency is greater than the area-to-aperture ratio\nof the film, indicating that light incident on the metal surface in between the holes\nwas also transmitted. Moreover, transmitted light propagates in a collinear direction\nwhich makes it intense and beamed rather diffracted [5]. With these characteristics\nfeatures such as high transmissivity, collinearity, and spectral coherence, EOT has\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\ngained substantial interest in the research community and has shown great potential\nin sensing, energy transfer, lasing, optical filtering, and photonic integrated circuits\n(PIC) [6–11]. In this review, we aim to discuss new developments that have occurred\nin the tunable EOT phenomenon and mainly focus on how the transition from passive\ncontrol of the EOT signal occurs towards active tuning of EOT light for its potential\nimplications in PIC. In section 2, the fundamentals of EOT are discussed with a\ndetailed description of the basic mechanism behind the EOT phenomenon. In section\n3, we provide a brief overview of passive control of EOT signal through geometrical\nparameters and the advancement in this area over the past two decades.

SPPs excite on the surface of a metal film perforated with\nsubwavelength holes, due to the coupling of incident light to the free electrons of\nthe metal. These SPPs in the form of evanescent waves propagate along the metal-\ndielectric interface and decay exponentially perpendicular to the surface. In a semi-\ninfinite metal-dielectric media, the dispersion relation of SPPs is characterized as the\ncomplex, frequency-dependent wave-vector kspp which is obtained by solving Maxwell’s\nequation with appropriate boundary conditions [13].\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\nkspp = ko\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.5**\n ϵmϵd\nϵm + ϵd\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nHere, ϵm(ω) and ϵd(ω) are the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity of metal\nand dielectric medium, respectively. To excite SPPs on the surface, one of the permit-\ntivities must have the opposite sign. This condition is satisfied by metals because ϵm\nis both negative and complex. On the other hand, when charge densities in the metal\ninteract with the electromagnetic (EM) field, the momentum of surface plasmon ℏkspp,\nis greater than the free-space momentum (ℏko) of the incoming photon (ko is a free\nspace wavevector). However, the periodic array of subwavelength holes provides extra\nmomentum to incoming photons through reciprocal lattice vectors, Gx =Gy = 2π/p,\nas a function of periodicity, p, and allows incident light to couple to SPPs. The momen-\ntum matching condition for the wavevectors then becomes, kspp = ko ± iGx ± jGy,\nwhere i and j are the indices for the scattering orders which determine the direction\nof SPPs. Using this momentum matching condition in Eq.1, the wavelength of SPPs,\nexcited by a Bragg’s-type scattering over a two-dimensional nanohole array is given\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFig. 2 Schematic diagram of an EOT structure (cross-section view). Au metal-nanohole array layered\non a glass substrate. A p-polarized light incident from the glass side excites SPPs. The transmitted\nlight that emerges from the metal-air side is mediated by the coupling of resonant and nonresonant\nSPP modes at both metal interfaces.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n ϵmϵd\nϵm + ϵd\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\np\ni + j\nwhere p is the period of hole array and ϵm is the real component of complex dielec-\ntric function of metal obtain through Lorentz-Drude model. The real part belongs to\nresonance wavelength whereas the negative imaginary part provides the non-radiative\ndamping effect. From Eq.2 it is clear that the wavelength of SPPs is influenced by\nthe geometrical parameters of the nanostructure such as the periodicity of hole array,\nproperties of the metal film, dielectric background, and the polarization of the incident\nlight. The relation of the EOT phenomenon with SPPs drives from the fact that the\nwavelength of the transmitted light shows similar dependence on the lattice period,\ndielectric medium, and the polarization of the incident light. The excitation of SPPs\nat the metal-glass interface and their constructive interference at both interfaces allow\nmore light to pass through the holes than would be expected based on conventional\noptics.\nTo explicitly understand the scattering of EOT light to the far field through the exci-\ntation of SPPs on both interfaces, we delve deeply into the microscopic description of\nEOT. Fig.2 demonstrates a cross-section of the Au metal-hole array structure layered\non a glass substrate with a thin adhesion layer of Cr. A TM-polarized plane wave,\npropagating in the z-direction incident on the glass side, excites SPPs at the metal-\nglass interface which tunnels through the holes. After passing through the hole, the\nSPPs interfere with the evanescent waves that are scattered at the metal-air inter-\nface resulting in the enhancement of light that propagates to the far field. The role of\nSPPs in this way is to enhance the fields associated with the evanescent waves, which\nresults in zero-order extraordinary transmission [15]. By zero-order, it means that the\nincident and transmitted light are collinear, supported by the tunneling transition of\nSPPs modes. This collinearity occurs when the wavelength of incident light is greater\nthan the grating period, which makes the direction of propagation, polarization, and\ndivergence of the transmitted beam identical to the incident beam [16]. Apart from\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nbound SPPs modes, surface plasmons are also excited at the rim of the subwavelength\nhole in the form of localized surface plasmons (LSP). In contrast to SPPs, LSP can\nbe excited through direct illumination of electromagnetic light on the curvature of the\nhole structure [17]. The intense localized modes at the edges of the hole cavity pro-\nvide directionality to SPPs waves while tunneling through the hole and their coupling\nwith SPPs mediated by Fano resonance contributes to enhanced transmission [18, 19].\nThese plasmonic modes (SPPs and LSP) form the basis of enhanced transmission, and\ntheir dynamical response at the top and bottom interfaces plays a crucial role in the\noptical properties of EOT light. Consequently, modulating the spectral, spatial, and\ntemporal dynamics of these modes enables coherent control of the EOT signal. Fun-\ndamentally, the spectral features of the SPPs and LSP modes depend on the geometry\nand dimensions of the metal–hole nanostructure [20]. More specifically, geometrical\nparameters, such as hole diameter, periodicity, and the dielectric medium alter the\nresponse of both plasmon resonances (SPPs/LSP). For a very thin metal film, the tun-\nneling of SPPs through the holes becomes resonant due to their coherent overlapping\nor interference on the top and bottom surfaces of the film. These diffraction/inter-\nference effects are accurately determined by the transmission spectrum. Nevertheless,\nthe peak spectral position of transmitted light is analyzed from Eq.2. The peaks in the\ntransmission spectrum indicate the resonant wavelength of those SPPs modes which\ninterfere constructively with the outgoing modes and result as peaks in the transmis-\nsion spectrum.\nThe spectrum of EOT contains very well-defined characteristic features. The bulk\nplasmon resonance of Ag metal is depicted by the first peak of the EOT spectrum\nas illustrated in Fig.1(a). After the wavelength coincides with the periodicity of hole\narrays, the spectrum shows two broad peaks of resonant transmission. These peaks are\nknown as transmission maxima, resulting from the SPPs coupling on the same surface\nas well as both sides of the metal interface [21]. The peak’s width is proportional to\nthe inhomogeneous broadening of the holes [22] and also reflects the oscillation time\nof the SPPs modes. The dips along maxima result from Wood’s anomaly that appears\nfor wavelengths diffracted from the perforated structure and propagates tangent to the\nmetal surface. Whereas, the width of the dip is proportional to the incident beam’s\ndispersion, which is entirely a geometrical effect [23, 24].\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.3**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.5**\n3 Passive Control of EOT\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFollowing the analysis of the EOT spectrum, the key factors that have a significant\nimpact on the shape and spectral characteristics of the transmission spectrum are\nmetal film thickness, hole diameter, array periodicity, and dielectric medium at the\nmetal interface. Modulating these parameters leads to the passive controlling of the\nEOT system and these geometrical parameters greatly influence the characteristics of\nthe EOT signal.

For shallow holes, SPPs on two interfaces coupled\nvia evanescent waves leads to the resonant coupling of SPPs modes which enhances\nthe efficiency of transmission. As the holes get deeper, most of the SPPs modes at\nboth interfaces do not couple efficiently resulting in a weak transmission that falls off\nexponentially with the increase in the hole depth. As the film thickness decreases the\ntransmission intensity increases exponentially along with a broadening in the peak [25]\n[see Fig.3(a)]. Martin-Moreno et al explain the broadening of the transmission peak\nthrough the minimal model, according to which an increase in the hole depth causes\nthe fast radiative decay of SPPs modes which in turn shortens the lifetime of SPPs\noscillations and increases the linewidth of the transmission peak [26] [see Fig.3(b)].\nOn the other hand, Carretero et al presented a quantitative theory to investigate the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nspectral shift in the transmission resonance as a function of film thickness and dielec-\ntric environment. In the detailed analysis, the results demonstrated that when the\nmetal film thickness is much smaller than the wavelength of light, the transmission\nis controlled by effective admittance of vacuum in the hole. When the film thickness\nis larger than the wavelength, the transmission is controlled by the cutoff of the fun-\ndamental waveguide mode inside the hole. In the case of thin film combined with\na high-index dielectric, the spectral position red-shifts compared to the cutoff wave-\nlength of the hole, and the transmission efficiency is increased substantially, as shown\nin Fig.3(c) [27]. Moreover, the transmission intensity decrease exponentially with the\nincrease in the film thickness, as shown in Fig.3(d). Agrawal et al also explored the\nimpact of film thickness on the enhanced transmission. They observed transmission for\nfilm thickness ranges from δ/15 to 2δ, where δ is the skin depth, which is ≈ 25 nm for\nsilver at the optical frequencies. In a detailed quantitative analysis, it was shown that\nas the film thickness increases from δ/15 to δ/6, there is a discernable enhancement\nin transmission resonance frequency. For the film thickness equal to the skin depth,\nthere is a sublinear enhancement in transmission. However, no significant enhance-\nment is observed for the films with thicknesses more than twice of skin depth [28].\nThese studies suggested that optimal film thickness enhances plasmonic coupling and\nboost transmission efficiency. The dielectric medium at the interface of metal surfaces\nalso has a significant impact on the transmission efficiency. The change in refractive\nindex n, caused by different dielectric mediums at the bottom and top interfaces of\nmetallic film, effects the coherent coupling of SPPs modes on both surfaces [29]. The\ncoupling becomes stronger for identical dielectric constant of sub- and superstrate. In\nthis way, SPPs resonances at the two interfaces coincide which enhances the transmis-\nsion by a factor of 10 [16]. Lindberg et al investigated the dependence of transmission\nwavelength on the material above and inside the single slit metal film. As the refrac-\ntive index of slit medium increases, there is significant redshift in the transmission\nwavelength, as shown in Fig.4(a) [30]. Yun Seon et al demonstrate the enhancement\nin the transmission efficiency along with the shift in its spectral position by adding a\nthin layer of lithium fluoride (LF) with a refractive index (n = 1.37) above [Fig.4(b)]\nand inside [Fig.4(c)] the metal surface [31]. Due to the high refractive index of LiF\nas compared to air, more surface charges are bound along the edges of the holes in\nFig.4(c), which causes a strong dipole moment around the hole. The localized charges\n(LSP) around the rims of the holes at both surfaces acts as a Fabry-Perot resonator\ninteracting with evanescent waves. The increase in the interaction between the surface\ncharges results in the lower energy level of surface plasmon due to which transmission\npeak redshifts from λ1 [see Fig.4(d)]. Grupp et al also suggested that the transmission\nefficiency depends on the dielectric properties of the in-plane metal surface within the\nskin depth [32]. Fig.4(e) shows an increase in the transmission efficiency by adding a\n20 nm layer of Ag metal to the Ni membrane perforated with nanohole. The enhance-\nment of EOT in a broken-symmetry structure is obtained by the phase-matched SPPs\non both surfaces and the consistency of dielectric around the surface. The consistency\nof the dielectric medium around all the surfaces is beneficial for the Febry-perot res-\nonant interaction between two LSP modes, which also results in higher transmission\n[33]. These studies suggested that the resonance wavelength of surface plasmons is\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFig. 4 (a) Transmittance spectra for thick Au film with a 15 nm wide slit for different materials\nwithin the slit.

For thin films, resonant coupling\nof SPPs enhances transmission efficiency, while increased film thickness leads to fast\nradiative decay of SPPs modes, broadening the transmission peak. Optimal thickness\nlies within a few multiples of the skin depth of the metal. However, these are not only\nthe counting factors to control the plasmon frequency and eventually EOT dynam-\nics. In the next section, we discuss the impact of hole array periodicity and its shape\non SPP propagation and how it influence the transmission resonance from metal-hole\narray structure.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\n3.2 The role of array periodicity and lattice shape on EOT\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nSubwavelength hole arrays play a major role in the enhancement of extraordinary\noptical transmission. Przybilla et al investigated the extraordinary transmission by\ncomparing a single-hole metal film to an array of subwavelength holes [34]. An isolated\nhole acts like a scatterer of incident light. This scattering yields excitation of LSP on\nthe hole edges, reflected waves around the hole, evanescent waves inside the cavity, and\npropagating waves on the surface of the film. In the case of a single hole these SPPs\ndissipate quickly and do not contribute much to the transmission. However, for arrays\nof holes, SPPs diffraction from the patterned surface resonantly coupled with other\nexcited modes and enhance the transmission. Furthermore, if the patterned structure\nis at both interfaces, the diffraction effects on the exit side can lead to a well-collimated\nbeam, and the transmission efficiency is enhanced one to two orders of magnitude in\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\ncontrast to single hole [35]. In the SPPs-based theory, the coupling of incident light\nto SPPs is supported by the periodicity of the hole lattice. However, the propagation\nlength of SPPs is much smaller than the lattice size which results from the ultrafast\ndamping of SPPs waves. In this way, the translation symmetry of the array plays an\nimportant role in the enhanced transmission [36, 37]. Mei et al investigated the impact\nof lattice periodicity and its shape on the transmission efficiency and found out that the\ntransmission intensity strongly depends on the design of the lattice period. In contrast\nto random hole arrays, quasiperiodic hole arrays provide long-range orders and offer\nsome dominant discrete reciprocal vectors which enable SPP-light coupling efficiently\nand yields enhanced EOT from nanohole arrays.

The result demonstrated long-range orders effect in quasiperiodic\nhole arrays which exhibit about 20% enhanced transmission at 707 nm wavelength.\nIn contrast to this, non-periodic hole arrays with short range orders do not offer such\nreciprocal lattice which leads to weak coupling of plasmons and no enhancement in\ntransmission peak, as shown in Fig.5(c) [38]. In another experimental study, enhanced\ntransmission is found in a random periodic structure with a lack of translation sym-\nmetry but long-range orders. To see the impact of lattice shape on the linewidth and\nspectral dynamics of transmission, Ek¸sio˘glu et al investigated the optical response of\nplasmons from square and hexagonal periodic arrays of circular holes. The schematic\nof Au film with these lattices layered on a silicon nitride is shown in Fig.5(d) and 5(e).\nFigure.5(f) demonstrate the shift in the resonance wavelength of transmission as a\nfunction of lattice period and for both square and hexagonal lattices the transmission\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\npeak redshifts as the lattice period increases [39]. As the matter of fact, hexagonal\narrays supports large figure-of-merit values due to its enhance EOT response. More-\nover, nanoholes with the hexagonal lattice show sharper linewidth in contrast to the\nsquare lattice. This is due to the fact that a closed paked hexagonal lattice has highest\nnanohole density and well-defined periodicity for long range SPP resonances [40]. The\nscattering of light from each hole in the array gives rise to several evanescent waves\npropagating away from the hole. When these composite evanescent waves arrive at the\nnext hole, it interfere with the light directly incident on the hole. Similarly, composite\nwaves scatter and interfere with SPPs at the other interface [41]. The enhancement\nand suppression in the transmission depends on the relative phase of the interfering\nwaves. Some theoretical studies have confirmed the role of interference of evanescent\nwaves [42, 43] and the role of SPPs surface waves in the transmission process. In such a\nstructure the transmission maxima occur due to the constructive interference of light\nthat scattered from each hole and diffracted SPP surface waves, which is referred to\nas interference modal [44, 45].\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFig. 6 SEM images of FIB milled annular aperture arrays (AAAs) with radius R1 = 125 nm,\nR2=215 nm, (a) period = 800 nm, (b) AAAs with period = 1400 nm on the x-axis and 800 nm on\nthe y-axis.

Following the dispersion relation of\nsurface plasmons the periodicity plays an important role in the excitation of coherent\nSPP modes on the patterned structure which propagates along the surface. This sug-\ngests that the spectral position of the surface plasmon can be modulated as a function\nof the periodicity through following expression in Eq.2. To see the impact of array\nperiodicity on the EOT spectrum, Kofke et al investigated the annual aperture arrays\n(AAAs) in a 150 nm thick Au film with two different lattice periods. SEM images of\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nAAAs with periods, 800 nm and 1400 nm along x-axis are shown in Fig.6(a) and 6(b),\nrespectively. Figures.6(c) and 6(d) shows the experimental results with spectral shifts\nin transmission spectra for array periodicity ranges from 600 nm - 1400 nm. The cor-\nresponding simulated results also demonstrate a vigorous shift in the peak spectral\nposition of transmission as a function of AAAs period [see Fig.6(e) and 6(f)]. More-\nover, as the lattice period decreases the transmission peaks broaden and blueshift with\nmaximum efficiency. This shift in the transmission wavelength resulted from the in-\nphase coupling of SPP-Bloch modes with other surface waves that are excited by the\nAAAs at Au/quartz interface [46]. Similarly, in another study, by varying the size of\nthe lattice constant ’a’ of an array of square holes from 250 nm to 650 nm, the peak\ntransmission wavelength redshifts to longer wavelengths and the intensity of the trans-\nmission peak decreases due to less interaction between LSP modes of the adjacent\nholes [47]. The periodicity of hole arrays ensures effective coupling of evanescent waves\nand supports SPP propagation, albeit limited by ultrafast damping. Properly tuned\nlattice geometry and symmetry are thus critical for achieving maximal transmission\nwith enhanced characteristics features. In the next section, we will explore some more\nstudies to understand the dynamics of EOT in different geometries, instead of hole\nstructure, such as metal gratings.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\n3.3 Extraordinary optical transmission from metal gratings\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nWhen compared to hole arrays, metal gratings in the shape of slits are very efficient\nfor transmitting EM radiation under the same conditions. The geometrical parameters\nsuch as width, diameter, thickness, and periodicity of grating influence the transmis-\nsion efficiency in the same way as in the case of holes. In grating-typed structures,\nupper surface modes couple to lower surface modes as a function of slit height which\ninfluences not only the peak intensity but also the spectral position of transmission\nwavelength. Porto et al proposed that transmission resonances are primarily excited\nby two EM modes in the lamellar metal gratings, as shown in Fig.7(a). Through the\ntransfer matrix formalism, it was evaluated that when the peak transmission wave-\nlength is equal to the periodicity of the grating structure, those peaks in the zero-order\ntransmission spectra result from coupled SPP modes [Fig.7(b)]. However, when the\ntransmission wavelength is longer than the grating period (d = 3.5µm), those spectral\npositions are due to the waveguide resonances, see spectra in Fig.7(c). Moreover, the\ntransmittance associated with coupled SPPs modes has a strong dependence on the\nangle of incidence. In contrast to this, waveguide modes are completely independent\nof incident angle. The waveguide modes are completely different from SPPs modes, for\nwhich the slits’ walls play a crucial role in inducing current densities along the walls\nwith opposite signs on both surfaces. These densities follow a parallel path and exit\nfrom the other side of the metal without getting affected by the refractive index of the\nsubstrate. Since the grating slits permit the coupling of each EM mode. Therefore,\nmodulating the slit’s diameter changes the bandwidth of transmission resonance pro-\nvided by SPPs. If the diameter of the slit is large (small), the transmitted resonance\nhas a broad (narrow) linewidth in the constituent spectrum. For large slit’ widths,\nthe transmission resonances are associated with the waveguide modes, and for this\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\ncase, the linewidth of the transmission peak gets broader as a function of slit diame-\nter [48]. Another study also indicted the importance of slit width in grating structure\nfor enhanced EOT efficiency. Iqbal et al proposed that slit width and its profile play\na vital role in grating structure to achieve maximum EOT corresponding to the opti-\nmum value of coupling efficiency. Smaller widths of slits offers higher scattering as\ncompared to scattering from the slits with wider widths. Higher scattering yields high\nefficiency of coupling incident light to SPPs modes due to higher Fourier components.\nThe smaller slits support higher order plasmon modes which start disappearing with\nthe increase in slit width. Moreover, it was suggested that an optimum transmission\nfrom grating device can be achieved for the slit width between one-third to one-half\nof the 770 nm period of grating [49]. This leads to an optimum slit width range for\nhigher transmission efficiency.\nThe transmission efficiency is also strongly influenced by the choice of the interface\nabove and below the EOT structure. Schr¨oter et al reported the difference in trans-\nmission intensity due to the excited SPPs modes for different direction of incidence\n(inset in Fig.7(d)). In figure.7(d), the transmission spectra show a more intense trans-\nmission signal from the glass side in contrast to the air side. This strong transmission\nresults from the mutual contribution of SPP modes, the tunneling photons, and the\nnew avalanche modes that excite at the edges of the slit on the air side and propagate\nthrough the cavity towards the glass side [50]. It should be noted that transmission\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFig. 7 (a) Schematic diagram of lamellar metal gratings with a = 0.5µm and d = 3.5µm.

So if due to substrate the\nenergies of two SPP modes on the upper and lower surface do not coincide, the cou-\npling is not appreciable, and as a result, decoupling is accompanied by a reduction of\ntransmission resonances with two nondegenerate modes appearing in the transmission\nspectrum with different wavelengths and low efficiencies. This reduction in the trans-\nmission intensity strongly depends on the dielectric permittivity of the medium as well\nas the height of the slits/hole. [52]. While coherent coupling of SPP modes stimulates\nthe peak efficiency of transmission resonances, their spatial distribution and propaga-\ntion direction also determine the enhancement in the transmitted signal. Garcia-Vidal\net al investigated the multiple paths for resonant modes in a groove-structured single-\nslit metal film [Fig.7(e)]. Three main mechanisms have been suggested that contribute\nto the transmission efficiency and enhanced it upto two-orders of magnitude even from\na single slit, (i) the groove cavity modes (GCM), (ii) the in-phase re-emission from\neach cavity, (iii) the slit’s waveguide modes. GCM can only be generated when the\ngrooves are perforated on the upper surface of the metal facing the illuminating light\nand facilitates multiple SPP modes contributing to transmittance as compared to the\nsystem without grooves. The combination of GCM and in-phase re-emission super-\nimposes and propagates towards the slot where they encounter the waveguide modes\ninside the long slit. The resonant coupling of GCM and in-phase re-emission from\ngrooves adds an extra peak at 560 nm in the transmission spectrum (not shown here).\nIn Fig.7(f), normalize transmittance spectra show that the groove period and its depth\nstrongly modulate the spectral position and peak intensity of transmittance, respec-\ntively [51]. This quantifies that the peak position of the transmission in both hole\narrays and grating structures is associated with the periodicity and index of refrac-\ntion. Whereas the slit’s width and height control the linewidth and intensity of the\ntransmission resonance effectively. In the next section, we will discuss the impact of\nhole geometry on transmission efficiency.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.4**\n3.4 Effect of hole shape and size on EOT\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThe optical characteristics of transmitted light such as polarization, directionality,\nand nonlinearity greatly influenced by the hole shape and its orientation. Gordon et al\ninvestigated the transmission properties of elliptical nanohole arrays which provide a\nmechanism for polarization selectivity in nanophotonic devices. It was shown that the\npolarization of transmitted light changes drastically for different orientations of ellip-\ntical holes and maximum transmission occurs for polarization angle perpendicular to\nthe major axis of the ellipse as shown in Fig.8(a). Moreover, the transmission intensity\nfrom elliptical holes gets maximum for p-polarization in contrast of s-polarization of\nincident light [see Fig.8(b)]. When the SPP mode propagates parallel to the electric\nfield polarization, the Braggs resonance (0,1) is aligned with the optical polarization\nwhich enhances the coupling to the grating parallel to the (0,1) direction. The aspect\nratio of elliptical holes also results in the multi-mode transmission due to the coupling\nof longitudinal and transverse SPP modes. Nevertheless, the increase in the hole diam-\neter decreases the area-to-aperture ratio which limits the propagation path of SPP\nmode and increases its decay rate, resulting in a blue shift in the transmitted light [53].\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFig. 8 (a) Transmission spectrum through elliptical hole for two orthogonal linear polarization with\n0.3 aspect ratio (b) Normalized transmission at (0,1) resonance peak for different orientations of\nelliptical holes.

On the other hand, the boundary conditions\naround the nanohole play a crucial role both in the aperture near-field distribution\nand far-field scattering. When light with appropriate polarization impinges on a single\nhole, it excites LSP on the ridges of the aperture, as shown in Fig.8(c). Because of its\ndipole nature, LSP causes unidirectional tunneling of SPPs from the hole. The space\nbetween the edges plays a significant role in the tunneling and coupling of evanescent\nwaves between both sides. The transmitted light is mainly re-scattered at the ridges\nthrough the LSP mode. The increase in the transmission intensity by reducing the\nhole size is similar to the increase in the scattering cross-section calculated for small\nmetal nanoparticles. The presence of dipole modes on the exit side restricts the spa-\ntial dispersion of light and keeps it unidirectional rather diffracting. In addition, the\nLSP dipole at the ridges causes the re-scattering of the propagating modes and with\nreduced size, the transmission intensity increases in the same way as the scattering\ncross-section evaluated for small nanoparticles. In this way, smaller hole diameters\nconfine surface plasmon modes effectively, resulting in sharper transmission peaks.\nDegiron et al investigated the role of different shape of holes on the EOT resonance.\nFor a spherical shape hole the transmission spectra demonstrate two peaks for differ-\nent hole depths ’h’ and it was found that for the shallowest holes (h= 200 nm), the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nlowest energy peak is supported by LSP mode, as shown in Fig.8(d). For a rectangu-\nlar aperture two exciting modes contribute to transmission and their mutual coupling\nresult in higher and lower energy peaks in the EOT spectrum which correspond to\ntransverse and longitudinal LSP modes, respectively [see Fig.8(e)]. As the value of y\ndecreases, longitudinal SPP mode redshifts to longer wavelengths. Nevertheless, the\npeak transmission normalized to the hole area increases as the hole size is reduced.\nThis is because the open space between the hole edges allows more tunneling and\nevanescent coupling between the two sides. Moreover, the spatial characteristics of\nLSP strongly depends on the polarization of incident light and the geometry of the\nhole. For different polarization angles, the transmission intensity shows a strong angu-\nlar dependence and get maximum when angle is perpendicular to long axis (x) of\nthe rectangular hole, as shown in Fig.8(c). Figure.8(f) demonstrate the modulation in\nLSP mode intensity at the ridges by changing the angle between the electric field and\nlongitudinal direction x. When the electric field polarization is perpendicular (90◦)\nto the longitudinal axis, propagating mode switches to LSP dipole mode around 700\nnm. Only the LSP mode oscillates along the axis normal to the polarization due to its\nmagnetic dipole nature [54]. Generally, the number of plasmon modes depends on the\nspatial orientation and size of each ridge. For a hole with identical edges such as square\nand cylindrical aperture, the LSP oscillating along each ridge are the same, as a result,\ntransmission is independent of polarization. Whereas, for triangular or rectangular\nshape holes, the optical properties of EOT light change due to non-centrosymmetric\nhole structure which causes the excitation of asymmetric SPPs modes on the surface.\nIn this way, polarization sensitivity of non circular holes offers additional control over\nthe transmitted signal. Moreover, the coupling of multi-resonant LSP modes at the\nridges with SPPs yields second-and third-harmonic generation at the metal-hole array\nwith high power efficiencies [55, 56].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.3**\n3.5 Impact of incident light on extraordinary optical\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\ntransmission\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThe spatial and spectral characteristics of transmitted light can also be modulated\nthrough the exciting pulse characteristics. For instance, the angle of incidence effec-\ntively modulates the propagation direction and intensity of the transmitted light. For\na minimum deviation in the incident angle, the transmission peak intensity shifts\nand splits into two new peaks which move in opposite directions and disappear for\nθ = 24◦ [2, 50]. Moreover, an oblique incidence results in high transmission efficiency\nwith a much larger cut-off than a normal incidence [57]. This is due to the fact that\nSPPs excitation at oblique incidence yields efficient unidirectional propagation and\nhigher relative coupling efficiency in the grating structures [58, 59]. In the near-field\nanalysis of surface waves through scanning near-field optical microscope (NSOM), a\nnon-uniform light distribution was observed over the hole array structure. This non-\nuniformity results from the finite size of the array or due to edge effects. The edge\neffect breaks the periodicity and SPPs reflected from each edge interferes with other\npropagating SPPs in between the holes. Another striking fact is that beam polarization\ncauses an asymmetric pattern of near-field along the x and y directions of the periodic\nstructure which results in the asymmetric transmission of light from the hole arrays\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\n[60]. The back-scattering of surface waves from the edges of the holes also contributes\nto the asymmetric patterns [61].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.3**\n3.6 Multimode extraordinary optical transmission\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nIf the hole cavities are decorated with an auxiliary object supporting localized plasmon\nmodes, then the multi-structured metal nanohole arrays yield multi-mode extraordi-\nnary optical transmission. The auxiliary objects in the form of nanorods (NRs) or\nnanoparticles (NPs) of different shapes situated inside or around the apertures, help\nto concentrate the energy inside the cavities and enhance the coupling efficiency of\nresonant modes at both metal surfaces. Larson et al demonstrated a new polarization-\ndependent EOT mode by texturing AgNRs around the spherical nanoholes (NHs), as\nshown in Fig.9(a). When the polarization is normal (ϕ = 90o) with respect to the long\naxis of NRs (h = 250 nm), the spectra show normal EOT mode (P2, red curve) in the\nvisible region. However, when polarization is parallel (ϕ = 0o) to long-axis of NR, a\nnew mode P3 (black curve) appears which is redshifted from P2 in the near-infrared\n(NIR) regime [see Figure.9(b)] [62]. This new EOT mode appears due to strong dipole\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nFig. 9 (a) Schematic of Ag nanorods on nanoholes NRonNH in Ag film.

The strong coupling of these two excited LSP modes allows\nSPPs to tunnel through holes without dispersion and also enables coherent coupling\nof SPPs, resulting in additional EOT peak. Figure.9(d) shows transmission spectra of\nsuch a NRinNH structure for different polarization of incident light. By tuning the\npolarization parallel to long axis of injected NRs, a new EOT mode originated at P3\nposition along with 68% enhancement in the transmission efficiency [63]. Yildiz et al\nalso demonstrated the enhancement in transmission efficiency upto 80% by placing\nnanoislands inside the holes filled with gain medium, as shown in Fig.9(e). Filling\nnanoislands with gain medium also modifies the transmission resonance with a spec-\ntral shift of 46 nm due to mode couplings which changes the optical permittivity of\nthe entire system [see Fig.9(f)]. Additionally, pumping gain medium actively enhance\nthe transmission efficiency above 100% [64]. On the other hand, a combined structure\nof periodic hole arrays in the form of ring resonators (RR), connected ring resonators\n(CRR), and split ring resonators (SPR) have shown transmission with high-quality\nfactor (Q) by incorporating the coherent coupling of both local and propagating modes\n[65]. Moreover, inducing spherical or cylindrical nanoparticles (NPs) inside nanoholes\nallows coherent mode couplings which results in the enhancement of EOT signal effi-\nciency upto 56% and 48%, respectively [66].\nThese studies have suggested that the addition of metal nanostructures inside the\nnanohole arrays system not only incorporates the excitation of multiple resonant\nmodes but also enables the coherent coupling between modes which enhances the\ntransmission efficiency with broad spectral bandwidth. The control of plasmon dynam-\nics through light polarization also modifies the optical characteristics of EOT signal\nsuch as wavelength and intensity. Nevertheless, these modifications in the EOT sen-\nsor are structure dependent or fixed and once the device is fabricated the operational\nbandwidth cannot be tuned actively and continuously. This limits the device’s capa-\nbility when it is desired to operate at various frequencies. Consequently, changing the\nstructure and geometry requires time-consuming processes such as design, production,\nand testing stages. Therefore to achieve transient switching or dynamical control over\noptical frequency signals, a scalable approach is to modulate surface plasmons in the\nEOT device through external stimuli. Such type of optimal control not only enables\non-demand coherent control of EOT light but also governs programmable photonic\nsystems for PIC applications.\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.3**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\n4 Active tunable EOT for sensor engineering and\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.3**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\nPIC technology\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThe ability to control the response of photonic devices from an external source give\nthem great versatility to employ them in a variety of photonic applications such as\nphotonic integrated sensing, information processing and single photon sources [67].\nOne of the most important functionalities of these photonic systems is operational fre-\nquency range.

The enhanced transmission from these metasurfaces results from\nthe complete suppression of resonant reflection due to destructive interference between\nelectric and magnetic dipole resonances supported by silicon nanodics [69]. Moreover,\nsome studies have suggested active control of EOT signal in near-infrared (NIR) and\nTHz regime by employing electrically tunable semiconductor materials layered with\nmetal nanohole structures.

For 5µm and 20µm wide holes, the intensity modulation\ndepth of the transmitted THz radiation is 52% and 30%, respectively, which shows that\nthe narrower hole reduce the damping of the resonance yielding a higher modulation\ndepth [70]. Similarly, Shaner et al demonstrated tunable EOT in mid-infrared regime\nby incorporating electrically tunable n-doped GaAs beneath the metal gratings, as\nshown in Fig. 10(c). Figure.10(d) shows normalized transmission and shift of 25 cm−1\nin its spectral position when the current is tuned from 0 to 200 mA. Moreover, trans-\nmission strength and linewidth remain stable for high current values which makes the\nuse of such device as tunable mid-IR optical components [71]. Some other studies have\nrevealed the scope of voltage-tunable graphene nanoribbons (GPRs) for spectral mod-\nulation of the transmission signal in the THz regime. Kim et al demonstrated efficiency\nand spectral modulation of transmitted light from EOT structure coupled to graphene\nplasmonic ribbons, as shown in Fig.10(e). By varying the Fermi level EF of gaphene (or\ngate Voltage Vg) from −50 to −450 the normalized transmission become stronger and\nshift to higher energies. Moreover, the modulation efficiency (ηT ) (normalized trans-\nmission spectra with transmission spectrum obtained from bare GPRs device) shows\nnarrow band features that become intense and shift to higher energies [see Fig.10(f)]\n[72, 73].

The thermo-optic (TO) modulator exhibits a tuning\nefficiency of 0.037nm/mW, a compact active area of 7.54µm2, and rapid response times\n[see Fig.11(d)]. While the electro-absorption (EA) modulator achieves a bandwidth\nof 26.8 GHz, a data rate of 56 Gb/s, energy consumption as low as 200 fJ/bit and\nfaster switching time (ns) due to high mobility of graphene [76].

E-mail(s): rsahin@itu.edu.tr; Contributing authors: hiraasif901@gmail.com;   Until the end of the 20th century, it was well-known that light could not pass through a subwavelength aperture in an opaque screen. According to the classical theory of diffraction given by Bethe in 1944, the transmission (T), normalized to hole diameter (d), is scaled as (d/λ)4, reduces to zero when the wavelength λ of incident light   is much larger than the hole diameter [1]. However, the advent of nanotechnology made it possible to engineer nanostructures and fabricate arrays of subwavelength holes in metals through focused ion beam milling or electron beam lithography tech- niques. Nanoscale engineering brought new insights into optical phenomena such as diffraction, transmission, reflection, and scattering of light from nanostructures and instigated the fields of subwavelength optics and nanophotonics. The advancements in nano-optics revolutionized optical sensing and nanoscale imaging techniques and uncovered various fascinating phenomena of light at the nanoscale under light-matter interaction. Among them was the extraordinary optical transmission (EOT).   When light strikes an optically thick metal film perforated with periodic arrays of subwavelength holes, more light transmits from the metal than impinges on it, known as EOT. In 1998, Ebbesen and his co-workers reported this unusual transmission from Ag film, perforated with nanoholes, with transmission efficiency exceeding unity [2]. To fabricate a hole array structure in Ag metal, the focused ion beam (FIB) was utilized, an image of such a structure is shown in Fig.1(b), and the zero-order transmission spectrum was obtained with a spectrophotometer using incoherent light sources [see Fig.1(a)]. Through this experiment, Ebbesen observed that EOT is only possible when (i) a TM polarized light is incident perpendicular to the metal film, (ii) the hole diameter is less than the wavelength of the incident light, and (iii) the periodicity of the hole arrays is resonant with transmission wavelength, (iv) solely metal film is utilized instead of semiconductor material such as Ge film [3, 4]. Under these conditions, it was found that the transmission was not only higher than the light impinging on the structure, but it also breached the transmission limit defined by Bethe. In addition, transmission efficiency is greater than the area-to-aperture ratio of the film, indicating that light incident on the metal surface in between the holes was also transmitted. Moreover, transmitted light propagates in a collinear direction which makes it intense and beamed rather diffracted [5]. With these characteristics features such as high transmissivity, collinearity, and spectral coherence, EOT has   gained substantial interest in the research community and has shown great potential in sensing, energy transfer, lasing, optical filtering, and photonic integrated circuits (PIC) [6–11]. In this review, we aim to discuss new developments that have occurred in the tunable EOT phenomenon and mainly focus on how the transition from passive control of the EOT signal occurs towards active tuning of EOT light for its potential implications in PIC. In section 2, the fundamentals of EOT are discussed with a detailed description of the basic mechanism behind the EOT phenomenon. In section 3, we provide a brief overview of passive control of EOT signal through geometrical parameters and the advancement in this area over the past two decades. Section 4 focuses on the active control of the EOT device through electrically tunable materials. In section 6, we explore the quantum control of the EOT signal following recent developments to optimize the EOT device as an electrically-programmable EOT switch. In section 7, we discuss the potential implications of plasmon-based EOT in PIC chips.   2 Fundamentals of Extraordinary Optical   The discovery of EOT has led many scientists to anticipate the mechanism behind the enhanced transmission and this inquisitiveness resulted in many follow-up studies that suggested the main mechanism behind EOT is the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) [3, 12]. SPPs excite on the surface of a metal film perforated with subwavelength holes, due to the coupling of incident light to the free electrons of the metal. These SPPs in the form of evanescent waves propagate along the metal- dielectric interface and decay exponentially perpendicular to the surface. In a semi- infinite metal-dielectric media, the dispersion relation of SPPs is characterized as the complex, frequency-dependent wave-vector kspp which is obtained by solving Maxwell’s equation with appropriate boundary conditions [13].    ϵmϵd ϵm + ϵd   Here, ϵm(ω) and ϵd(ω) are the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity of metal and dielectric medium, respectively. To excite SPPs on the surface, one of the permit- tivities must have the opposite sign. This condition is satisfied by metals because ϵm is both negative and complex. On the other hand, when charge densities in the metal interact with the electromagnetic (EM) field, the momentum of surface plasmon ℏkspp, is greater than the free-space momentum (ℏko) of the incoming photon (ko is a free space wavevector). However, the periodic array of subwavelength holes provides extra momentum to incoming photons through reciprocal lattice vectors, Gx =Gy = 2π/p, as a function of periodicity, p, and allows incident light to couple to SPPs. The momen- tum matching condition for the wavevectors then becomes, kspp = ko ± iGx ± jGy, where i and j are the indices for the scattering orders which determine the direction of SPPs. Using this momentum matching condition in Eq.1, the wavelength of SPPs, excited by a Bragg’s-type scattering over a two-dimensional nanohole array is given    ϵmϵd ϵm + ϵd   p i + j where p is the period of hole array and ϵm is the real component of complex dielec- tric function of metal obtain through Lorentz-Drude model. The real part belongs to resonance wavelength whereas the negative imaginary part provides the non-radiative damping effect. From Eq.2 it is clear that the wavelength of SPPs is influenced by the geometrical parameters of the nanostructure such as the periodicity of hole array, properties of the metal film, dielectric background, and the polarization of the incident light. The relation of the EOT phenomenon with SPPs drives from the fact that the wavelength of the transmitted light shows similar dependence on the lattice period, dielectric medium, and the polarization of the incident light. The excitation of SPPs at the metal-glass interface and their constructive interference at both interfaces allow more light to pass through the holes than would be expected based on conventional optics. To explicitly understand the scattering of EOT light to the far field through the exci- tation of SPPs on both interfaces, we delve deeply into the microscopic description of EOT. Fig.2 demonstrates a cross-section of the Au metal-hole array structure layered on a glass substrate with a thin adhesion layer of Cr. A TM-polarized plane wave, propagating in the z-direction incident on the glass side, excites SPPs at the metal- glass interface which tunnels through the holes. After passing through the hole, the SPPs interfere with the evanescent waves that are scattered at the metal-air inter- face resulting in the enhancement of light that propagates to the far field. The role of SPPs in this way is to enhance the fields associated with the evanescent waves, which results in zero-order extraordinary transmission [15]. By zero-order, it means that the incident and transmitted light are collinear, supported by the tunneling transition of SPPs modes. This collinearity occurs when the wavelength of incident light is greater than the grating period, which makes the direction of propagation, polarization, and divergence of the transmitted beam identical to the incident beam [16]. Apart from   bound SPPs modes, surface plasmons are also excited at the rim of the subwavelength hole in the form of localized surface plasmons (LSP). In contrast to SPPs, LSP can be excited through direct illumination of electromagnetic light on the curvature of the hole structure [17]. The intense localized modes at the edges of the hole cavity pro- vide directionality to SPPs waves while tunneling through the hole and their coupling with SPPs mediated by Fano resonance contributes to enhanced transmission [18, 19]. These plasmonic modes (SPPs and LSP) form the basis of enhanced transmission, and their dynamical response at the top and bottom interfaces plays a crucial role in the optical properties of EOT light. Consequently, modulating the spectral, spatial, and temporal dynamics of these modes enables coherent control of the EOT signal. Fun- damentally, the spectral features of the SPPs and LSP modes depend on the geometry and dimensions of the metal–hole nanostructure [20]. More specifically, geometrical parameters, such as hole diameter, periodicity, and the dielectric medium alter the response of both plasmon resonances (SPPs/LSP). For a very thin metal film, the tun- neling of SPPs through the holes becomes resonant due to their coherent overlapping or interference on the top and bottom surfaces of the film. These diffraction/inter- ference effects are accurately determined by the transmission spectrum. Nevertheless, the peak spectral position of transmitted light is analyzed from Eq.2. The peaks in the transmission spectrum indicate the resonant wavelength of those SPPs modes which interfere constructively with the outgoing modes and result as peaks in the transmis- sion spectrum. The spectrum of EOT contains very well-defined characteristic features. The bulk plasmon resonance of Ag metal is depicted by the first peak of the EOT spectrum as illustrated in Fig.1(a). After the wavelength coincides with the periodicity of hole arrays, the spectrum shows two broad peaks of resonant transmission. These peaks are known as transmission maxima, resulting from the SPPs coupling on the same surface as well as both sides of the metal interface [21]. The peak’s width is proportional to the inhomogeneous broadening of the holes [22] and also reflects the oscillation time of the SPPs modes. The dips along maxima result from Wood’s anomaly that appears for wavelengths diffracted from the perforated structure and propagates tangent to the metal surface. Whereas, the width of the dip is proportional to the incident beam’s dispersion, which is entirely a geometrical effect [23, 24].   3 Passive Control of EOT   Following the analysis of the EOT spectrum, the key factors that have a significant impact on the shape and spectral characteristics of the transmission spectrum are metal film thickness, hole diameter, array periodicity, and dielectric medium at the metal interface. Modulating these parameters leads to the passive controlling of the EOT system and these geometrical parameters greatly influence the characteristics of the EOT signal. In the following sections, we discuss the impact of these structural parameters on the enhanced transmission.   3.1 Effect of film thickness/hole depth and the dielectric   medium on EOT   The intensity of the transmission peak is decreased by increasing the hole depth (film thickness), investigated by Degiron et al in the experimental study for the case of a square array of cylindrical holes. For shallow holes, SPPs on two interfaces coupled via evanescent waves leads to the resonant coupling of SPPs modes which enhances the efficiency of transmission. As the holes get deeper, most of the SPPs modes at both interfaces do not couple efficiently resulting in a weak transmission that falls off exponentially with the increase in the hole depth. As the film thickness decreases the transmission intensity increases exponentially along with a broadening in the peak [25] [see Fig.3(a)]. Martin-Moreno et al explain the broadening of the transmission peak through the minimal model, according to which an increase in the hole depth causes the fast radiative decay of SPPs modes which in turn shortens the lifetime of SPPs oscillations and increases the linewidth of the transmission peak [26] [see Fig.3(b)]. On the other hand, Carretero et al presented a quantitative theory to investigate the   spectral shift in the transmission resonance as a function of film thickness and dielec- tric environment. In the detailed analysis, the results demonstrated that when the metal film thickness is much smaller than the wavelength of light, the transmission is controlled by effective admittance of vacuum in the hole. When the film thickness is larger than the wavelength, the transmission is controlled by the cutoff of the fun- damental waveguide mode inside the hole. In the case of thin film combined with a high-index dielectric, the spectral position red-shifts compared to the cutoff wave- length of the hole, and the transmission efficiency is increased substantially, as shown in Fig.3(c) [27]. Moreover, the transmission intensity decrease exponentially with the increase in the film thickness, as shown in Fig.3(d). Agrawal et al also explored the impact of film thickness on the enhanced transmission. They observed transmission for film thickness ranges from δ/15 to 2δ, where δ is the skin depth, which is ≈ 25 nm for silver at the optical frequencies. In a detailed quantitative analysis, it was shown that as the film thickness increases from δ/15 to δ/6, there is a discernable enhancement in transmission resonance frequency. For the film thickness equal to the skin depth, there is a sublinear enhancement in transmission. However, no significant enhance- ment is observed for the films with thicknesses more than twice of skin depth [28]. These studies suggested that optimal film thickness enhances plasmonic coupling and boost transmission efficiency. The dielectric medium at the interface of metal surfaces also has a significant impact on the transmission efficiency. The change in refractive index n, caused by different dielectric mediums at the bottom and top interfaces of metallic film, effects the coherent coupling of SPPs modes on both surfaces [29]. The coupling becomes stronger for identical dielectric constant of sub- and superstrate. In this way, SPPs resonances at the two interfaces coincide which enhances the transmis- sion by a factor of 10 [16]. Lindberg et al investigated the dependence of transmission wavelength on the material above and inside the single slit metal film. As the refrac- tive index of slit medium increases, there is significant redshift in the transmission wavelength, as shown in Fig.4(a) [30]. Yun Seon et al demonstrate the enhancement in the transmission efficiency along with the shift in its spectral position by adding a thin layer of lithium fluoride (LF) with a refractive index (n = 1.37) above [Fig.4(b)] and inside [Fig.4(c)] the metal surface [31]. Due to the high refractive index of LiF as compared to air, more surface charges are bound along the edges of the holes in Fig.4(c), which causes a strong dipole moment around the hole. The localized charges (LSP) around the rims of the holes at both surfaces acts as a Fabry-Perot resonator interacting with evanescent waves. The increase in the interaction between the surface charges results in the lower energy level of surface plasmon due to which transmission peak redshifts from λ1 [see Fig.4(d)]. Grupp et al also suggested that the transmission efficiency depends on the dielectric properties of the in-plane metal surface within the skin depth [32]. Fig.4(e) shows an increase in the transmission efficiency by adding a 20 nm layer of Ag metal to the Ni membrane perforated with nanohole. The enhance- ment of EOT in a broken-symmetry structure is obtained by the phase-matched SPPs on both surfaces and the consistency of dielectric around the surface. The consistency of the dielectric medium around all the surfaces is beneficial for the Febry-perot res- onant interaction between two LSP modes, which also results in higher transmission [33]. These studies suggested that the resonance wavelength of surface plasmons is   strongly influenced by medium around the metal surface and its propagation constant changes drastically as the function of hole thickness. For thin films, resonant coupling of SPPs enhances transmission efficiency, while increased film thickness leads to fast radiative decay of SPPs modes, broadening the transmission peak. Optimal thickness lies within a few multiples of the skin depth of the metal. However, these are not only the counting factors to control the plasmon frequency and eventually EOT dynam- ics. In the next section, we discuss the impact of hole array periodicity and its shape on SPP propagation and how it influence the transmission resonance from metal-hole array structure.   3.2 The role of array periodicity and lattice shape on EOT   Subwavelength hole arrays play a major role in the enhancement of extraordinary optical transmission. Przybilla et al investigated the extraordinary transmission by comparing a single-hole metal film to an array of subwavelength holes [34]. An isolated hole acts like a scatterer of incident light. This scattering yields excitation of LSP on the hole edges, reflected waves around the hole, evanescent waves inside the cavity, and propagating waves on the surface of the film. In the case of a single hole these SPPs dissipate quickly and do not contribute much to the transmission. However, for arrays of holes, SPPs diffraction from the patterned surface resonantly coupled with other excited modes and enhance the transmission. Furthermore, if the patterned structure is at both interfaces, the diffraction effects on the exit side can lead to a well-collimated beam, and the transmission efficiency is enhanced one to two orders of magnitude in   contrast to single hole [35]. In the SPPs-based theory, the coupling of incident light to SPPs is supported by the periodicity of the hole lattice. However, the propagation length of SPPs is much smaller than the lattice size which results from the ultrafast damping of SPPs waves. In this way, the translation symmetry of the array plays an important role in the enhanced transmission [36, 37]. Mei et al investigated the impact of lattice periodicity and its shape on the transmission efficiency and found out that the transmission intensity strongly depends on the design of the lattice period. In contrast to random hole arrays, quasiperiodic hole arrays provide long-range orders and offer some dominant discrete reciprocal vectors which enable SPP-light coupling efficiently and yields enhanced EOT from nanohole arrays. Figure.5(a) and 5(b) show nanohole   structure with quasiperiodic and non-periodic lattices perforated in 120 nm thick Au films, respectively. The result demonstrated long-range orders effect in quasiperiodic hole arrays which exhibit about 20% enhanced transmission at 707 nm wavelength. In contrast to this, non-periodic hole arrays with short range orders do not offer such reciprocal lattice which leads to weak coupling of plasmons and no enhancement in transmission peak, as shown in Fig.5(c) [38]. In another experimental study, enhanced transmission is found in a random periodic structure with a lack of translation sym- metry but long-range orders. To see the impact of lattice shape on the linewidth and spectral dynamics of transmission, Ek¸sio˘glu et al investigated the optical response of plasmons from square and hexagonal periodic arrays of circular holes. The schematic of Au film with these lattices layered on a silicon nitride is shown in Fig.5(d) and 5(e). Figure.5(f) demonstrate the shift in the resonance wavelength of transmission as a function of lattice period and for both square and hexagonal lattices the transmission   peak redshifts as the lattice period increases [39]. As the matter of fact, hexagonal arrays supports large figure-of-merit values due to its enhance EOT response. More- over, nanoholes with the hexagonal lattice show sharper linewidth in contrast to the square lattice. This is due to the fact that a closed paked hexagonal lattice has highest nanohole density and well-defined periodicity for long range SPP resonances [40]. The scattering of light from each hole in the array gives rise to several evanescent waves propagating away from the hole. When these composite evanescent waves arrive at the next hole, it interfere with the light directly incident on the hole. Similarly, composite waves scatter and interfere with SPPs at the other interface [41]. The enhancement and suppression in the transmission depends on the relative phase of the interfering waves. Some theoretical studies have confirmed the role of interference of evanescent waves [42, 43] and the role of SPPs surface waves in the transmission process. In such a structure the transmission maxima occur due to the constructive interference of light that scattered from each hole and diffracted SPP surface waves, which is referred to as interference modal [44, 45].   Apart from lattice shape and symmetry, its periodicity also strongly impacts on the peak spectral position of transmission resonance. Following the dispersion relation of surface plasmons the periodicity plays an important role in the excitation of coherent SPP modes on the patterned structure which propagates along the surface. This sug- gests that the spectral position of the surface plasmon can be modulated as a function of the periodicity through following expression in Eq.2. To see the impact of array periodicity on the EOT spectrum, Kofke et al investigated the annual aperture arrays (AAAs) in a 150 nm thick Au film with two different lattice periods. SEM images of   AAAs with periods, 800 nm and 1400 nm along x-axis are shown in Fig.6(a) and 6(b), respectively. Figures.6(c) and 6(d) shows the experimental results with spectral shifts in transmission spectra for array periodicity ranges from 600 nm - 1400 nm. The cor- responding simulated results also demonstrate a vigorous shift in the peak spectral position of transmission as a function of AAAs period [see Fig.6(e) and 6(f)]. More- over, as the lattice period decreases the transmission peaks broaden and blueshift with maximum efficiency. This shift in the transmission wavelength resulted from the in- phase coupling of SPP-Bloch modes with other surface waves that are excited by the AAAs at Au/quartz interface [46]. Similarly, in another study, by varying the size of the lattice constant ’a’ of an array of square holes from 250 nm to 650 nm, the peak transmission wavelength redshifts to longer wavelengths and the intensity of the trans- mission peak decreases due to less interaction between LSP modes of the adjacent holes [47]. The periodicity of hole arrays ensures effective coupling of evanescent waves and supports SPP propagation, albeit limited by ultrafast damping. Properly tuned lattice geometry and symmetry are thus critical for achieving maximal transmission with enhanced characteristics features. In the next section, we will explore some more studies to understand the dynamics of EOT in different geometries, instead of hole structure, such as metal gratings.   3.3 Extraordinary optical transmission from metal gratings   When compared to hole arrays, metal gratings in the shape of slits are very efficient for transmitting EM radiation under the same conditions. The geometrical parameters such as width, diameter, thickness, and periodicity of grating influence the transmis- sion efficiency in the same way as in the case of holes. In grating-typed structures, upper surface modes couple to lower surface modes as a function of slit height which influences not only the peak intensity but also the spectral position of transmission wavelength. Porto et al proposed that transmission resonances are primarily excited by two EM modes in the lamellar metal gratings, as shown in Fig.7(a). Through the transfer matrix formalism, it was evaluated that when the peak transmission wave- length is equal to the periodicity of the grating structure, those peaks in the zero-order transmission spectra result from coupled SPP modes [Fig.7(b)]. However, when the transmission wavelength is longer than the grating period (d = 3.5µm), those spectral positions are due to the waveguide resonances, see spectra in Fig.7(c). Moreover, the transmittance associated with coupled SPPs modes has a strong dependence on the angle of incidence. In contrast to this, waveguide modes are completely independent of incident angle. The waveguide modes are completely different from SPPs modes, for which the slits’ walls play a crucial role in inducing current densities along the walls with opposite signs on both surfaces. These densities follow a parallel path and exit from the other side of the metal without getting affected by the refractive index of the substrate. Since the grating slits permit the coupling of each EM mode. Therefore, modulating the slit’s diameter changes the bandwidth of transmission resonance pro- vided by SPPs. If the diameter of the slit is large (small), the transmitted resonance has a broad (narrow) linewidth in the constituent spectrum. For large slit’ widths, the transmission resonances are associated with the waveguide modes, and for this   case, the linewidth of the transmission peak gets broader as a function of slit diame- ter [48]. Another study also indicted the importance of slit width in grating structure for enhanced EOT efficiency. Iqbal et al proposed that slit width and its profile play a vital role in grating structure to achieve maximum EOT corresponding to the opti- mum value of coupling efficiency. Smaller widths of slits offers higher scattering as compared to scattering from the slits with wider widths. Higher scattering yields high efficiency of coupling incident light to SPPs modes due to higher Fourier components. The smaller slits support higher order plasmon modes which start disappearing with the increase in slit width. Moreover, it was suggested that an optimum transmission from grating device can be achieved for the slit width between one-third to one-half of the 770 nm period of grating [49]. This leads to an optimum slit width range for higher transmission efficiency. The transmission efficiency is also strongly influenced by the choice of the interface above and below the EOT structure. Schr¨oter et al reported the difference in trans- mission intensity due to the excited SPPs modes for different direction of incidence (inset in Fig.7(d)). In figure.7(d), the transmission spectra show a more intense trans- mission signal from the glass side in contrast to the air side. This strong transmission results from the mutual contribution of SPP modes, the tunneling photons, and the new avalanche modes that excite at the edges of the slit on the air side and propagate through the cavity towards the glass side [50]. It should be noted that transmission   resonance is very sensitive to the dielectric medium or substrate attached to the part of the metal surface from which light travels to the far field. So if due to substrate the energies of two SPP modes on the upper and lower surface do not coincide, the cou- pling is not appreciable, and as a result, decoupling is accompanied by a reduction of transmission resonances with two nondegenerate modes appearing in the transmission spectrum with different wavelengths and low efficiencies. This reduction in the trans- mission intensity strongly depends on the dielectric permittivity of the medium as well as the height of the slits/hole. [52]. While coherent coupling of SPP modes stimulates the peak efficiency of transmission resonances, their spatial distribution and propaga- tion direction also determine the enhancement in the transmitted signal. Garcia-Vidal et al investigated the multiple paths for resonant modes in a groove-structured single- slit metal film [Fig.7(e)]. Three main mechanisms have been suggested that contribute to the transmission efficiency and enhanced it upto two-orders of magnitude even from a single slit, (i) the groove cavity modes (GCM), (ii) the in-phase re-emission from each cavity, (iii) the slit’s waveguide modes. GCM can only be generated when the grooves are perforated on the upper surface of the metal facing the illuminating light and facilitates multiple SPP modes contributing to transmittance as compared to the system without grooves. The combination of GCM and in-phase re-emission super- imposes and propagates towards the slot where they encounter the waveguide modes inside the long slit. The resonant coupling of GCM and in-phase re-emission from grooves adds an extra peak at 560 nm in the transmission spectrum (not shown here). In Fig.7(f), normalize transmittance spectra show that the groove period and its depth strongly modulate the spectral position and peak intensity of transmittance, respec- tively [51]. This quantifies that the peak position of the transmission in both hole arrays and grating structures is associated with the periodicity and index of refrac- tion. Whereas the slit’s width and height control the linewidth and intensity of the transmission resonance effectively. In the next section, we will discuss the impact of hole geometry on transmission efficiency.   3.4 Effect of hole shape and size on EOT   The optical characteristics of transmitted light such as polarization, directionality, and nonlinearity greatly influenced by the hole shape and its orientation. Gordon et al investigated the transmission properties of elliptical nanohole arrays which provide a mechanism for polarization selectivity in nanophotonic devices. It was shown that the polarization of transmitted light changes drastically for different orientations of ellip- tical holes and maximum transmission occurs for polarization angle perpendicular to the major axis of the ellipse as shown in Fig.8(a). Moreover, the transmission intensity from elliptical holes gets maximum for p-polarization in contrast of s-polarization of incident light [see Fig.8(b)]. When the SPP mode propagates parallel to the electric field polarization, the Braggs resonance (0,1) is aligned with the optical polarization which enhances the coupling to the grating parallel to the (0,1) direction. The aspect ratio of elliptical holes also results in the multi-mode transmission due to the coupling of longitudinal and transverse SPP modes. Nevertheless, the increase in the hole diam- eter decreases the area-to-aperture ratio which limits the propagation path of SPP mode and increases its decay rate, resulting in a blue shift in the transmitted light [53].   Because SPPs does not propagate in the cavities, a small spatial region for surface wave propagation incorporates the fast decay of SPPs modes, causing the transmis- sion efficiency to decrease vigorously. On the other hand, the boundary conditions around the nanohole play a crucial role both in the aperture near-field distribution and far-field scattering. When light with appropriate polarization impinges on a single hole, it excites LSP on the ridges of the aperture, as shown in Fig.8(c). Because of its dipole nature, LSP causes unidirectional tunneling of SPPs from the hole. The space between the edges plays a significant role in the tunneling and coupling of evanescent waves between both sides. The transmitted light is mainly re-scattered at the ridges through the LSP mode. The increase in the transmission intensity by reducing the hole size is similar to the increase in the scattering cross-section calculated for small metal nanoparticles. The presence of dipole modes on the exit side restricts the spa- tial dispersion of light and keeps it unidirectional rather diffracting. In addition, the LSP dipole at the ridges causes the re-scattering of the propagating modes and with reduced size, the transmission intensity increases in the same way as the scattering cross-section evaluated for small nanoparticles. In this way, smaller hole diameters confine surface plasmon modes effectively, resulting in sharper transmission peaks. Degiron et al investigated the role of different shape of holes on the EOT resonance. For a spherical shape hole the transmission spectra demonstrate two peaks for differ- ent hole depths ’h’ and it was found that for the shallowest holes (h= 200 nm), the   lowest energy peak is supported by LSP mode, as shown in Fig.8(d). For a rectangu- lar aperture two exciting modes contribute to transmission and their mutual coupling result in higher and lower energy peaks in the EOT spectrum which correspond to transverse and longitudinal LSP modes, respectively [see Fig.8(e)]. As the value of y decreases, longitudinal SPP mode redshifts to longer wavelengths. Nevertheless, the peak transmission normalized to the hole area increases as the hole size is reduced. This is because the open space between the hole edges allows more tunneling and evanescent coupling between the two sides. Moreover, the spatial characteristics of LSP strongly depends on the polarization of incident light and the geometry of the hole. For different polarization angles, the transmission intensity shows a strong angu- lar dependence and get maximum when angle is perpendicular to long axis (x) of the rectangular hole, as shown in Fig.8(c). Figure.8(f) demonstrate the modulation in LSP mode intensity at the ridges by changing the angle between the electric field and longitudinal direction x. When the electric field polarization is perpendicular (90◦) to the longitudinal axis, propagating mode switches to LSP dipole mode around 700 nm. Only the LSP mode oscillates along the axis normal to the polarization due to its magnetic dipole nature [54]. Generally, the number of plasmon modes depends on the spatial orientation and size of each ridge. For a hole with identical edges such as square and cylindrical aperture, the LSP oscillating along each ridge are the same, as a result, transmission is independent of polarization. Whereas, for triangular or rectangular shape holes, the optical properties of EOT light change due to non-centrosymmetric hole structure which causes the excitation of asymmetric SPPs modes on the surface. In this way, polarization sensitivity of non circular holes offers additional control over the transmitted signal. Moreover, the coupling of multi-resonant LSP modes at the ridges with SPPs yields second-and third-harmonic generation at the metal-hole array with high power efficiencies [55, 56].   3.5 Impact of incident light on extraordinary optical   transmission   The spatial and spectral characteristics of transmitted light can also be modulated through the exciting pulse characteristics. For instance, the angle of incidence effec- tively modulates the propagation direction and intensity of the transmitted light. For a minimum deviation in the incident angle, the transmission peak intensity shifts and splits into two new peaks which move in opposite directions and disappear for θ = 24◦ [2, 50]. Moreover, an oblique incidence results in high transmission efficiency with a much larger cut-off than a normal incidence [57]. This is due to the fact that SPPs excitation at oblique incidence yields efficient unidirectional propagation and higher relative coupling efficiency in the grating structures [58, 59]. In the near-field analysis of surface waves through scanning near-field optical microscope (NSOM), a non-uniform light distribution was observed over the hole array structure. This non- uniformity results from the finite size of the array or due to edge effects. The edge effect breaks the periodicity and SPPs reflected from each edge interferes with other propagating SPPs in between the holes. Another striking fact is that beam polarization causes an asymmetric pattern of near-field along the x and y directions of the periodic structure which results in the asymmetric transmission of light from the hole arrays   [60]. The back-scattering of surface waves from the edges of the holes also contributes to the asymmetric patterns [61].   3.6 Multimode extraordinary optical transmission   If the hole cavities are decorated with an auxiliary object supporting localized plasmon modes, then the multi-structured metal nanohole arrays yield multi-mode extraordi- nary optical transmission. The auxiliary objects in the form of nanorods (NRs) or nanoparticles (NPs) of different shapes situated inside or around the apertures, help to concentrate the energy inside the cavities and enhance the coupling efficiency of resonant modes at both metal surfaces. Larson et al demonstrated a new polarization- dependent EOT mode by texturing AgNRs around the spherical nanoholes (NHs), as shown in Fig.9(a). When the polarization is normal (ϕ = 90o) with respect to the long axis of NRs (h = 250 nm), the spectra show normal EOT mode (P2, red curve) in the visible region. However, when polarization is parallel (ϕ = 0o) to long-axis of NR, a new mode P3 (black curve) appears which is redshifted from P2 in the near-infrared (NIR) regime [see Figure.9(b)] [62]. This new EOT mode appears due to strong dipole   radiation of LSP modes at the tip of NRs placed around the nanohole. Similarly, Wang et al demonstrated that by placing NRs inside the NHs facilitates the coupling of two LSP modes, one on the edges of the NRs and the other at the ridges of the   NHs, as shown in Fig.9(c). The strong coupling of these two excited LSP modes allows SPPs to tunnel through holes without dispersion and also enables coherent coupling of SPPs, resulting in additional EOT peak. Figure.9(d) shows transmission spectra of such a NRinNH structure for different polarization of incident light. By tuning the polarization parallel to long axis of injected NRs, a new EOT mode originated at P3 position along with 68% enhancement in the transmission efficiency [63]. Yildiz et al also demonstrated the enhancement in transmission efficiency upto 80% by placing nanoislands inside the holes filled with gain medium, as shown in Fig.9(e). Filling nanoislands with gain medium also modifies the transmission resonance with a spec- tral shift of 46 nm due to mode couplings which changes the optical permittivity of the entire system [see Fig.9(f)]. Additionally, pumping gain medium actively enhance the transmission efficiency above 100% [64]. On the other hand, a combined structure of periodic hole arrays in the form of ring resonators (RR), connected ring resonators (CRR), and split ring resonators (SPR) have shown transmission with high-quality factor (Q) by incorporating the coherent coupling of both local and propagating modes [65]. Moreover, inducing spherical or cylindrical nanoparticles (NPs) inside nanoholes allows coherent mode couplings which results in the enhancement of EOT signal effi- ciency upto 56% and 48%, respectively [66]. These studies have suggested that the addition of metal nanostructures inside the nanohole arrays system not only incorporates the excitation of multiple resonant modes but also enables the coherent coupling between modes which enhances the transmission efficiency with broad spectral bandwidth. The control of plasmon dynam- ics through light polarization also modifies the optical characteristics of EOT signal such as wavelength and intensity. Nevertheless, these modifications in the EOT sen- sor are structure dependent or fixed and once the device is fabricated the operational bandwidth cannot be tuned actively and continuously. This limits the device’s capa- bility when it is desired to operate at various frequencies. Consequently, changing the structure and geometry requires time-consuming processes such as design, production, and testing stages. Therefore to achieve transient switching or dynamical control over optical frequency signals, a scalable approach is to modulate surface plasmons in the EOT device through external stimuli. Such type of optimal control not only enables on-demand coherent control of EOT light but also governs programmable photonic systems for PIC applications.   4 Active tunable EOT for sensor engineering and   PIC technology   The ability to control the response of photonic devices from an external source give them great versatility to employ them in a variety of photonic applications such as photonic integrated sensing, information processing and single photon sources [67]. One of the most important functionalities of these photonic systems is operational fre- quency range. The soul purpose of active tuning of photonic devices is to control the transmission frequency according to the desire applications. For this purpose, many studies have utilized active tunable materials in the form of semiconductors, dielectrics   and graphene nanostructures to explore active control of EOT signal in a broad spec- tral range (UV to IR). Metal films with high plasma frequencies perforated with hole arrays proved to be a good candidate for enhanced EOT in the ultraviolet region [68]. On the other hand, a high index engineered 2D metasurface shows tremendous capac- ity to manipulate the phase, amplitude and polarization of light with high resolution in visible and IR regions. For instance, Ye Feng et al demonstrated close-to-unity res- onant transmission in the visible regime from silicon nanodics periodically arranged on silica substrate. The enhanced transmission from these metasurfaces results from the complete suppression of resonant reflection due to destructive interference between electric and magnetic dipole resonances supported by silicon nanodics [69]. Moreover, some studies have suggested active control of EOT signal in near-infrared (NIR) and THz regime by employing electrically tunable semiconductor materials layered with metal nanohole structures. For instance, Chen et al utilized electrically controllable   n-doped semiconductor (GaAs) material as a dielectric switch to obtain transmission in the THz regime [see Fig.10(a)]. Figure.10(b) demonstrate the intensity modula- tion of THz transmission by applying reverse voltage bias. With the reverse bias the   increasing depletion region reduces the losses in dielectric and thereby enhancing the THz transmission resonance. For 5µm and 20µm wide holes, the intensity modulation depth of the transmitted THz radiation is 52% and 30%, respectively, which shows that the narrower hole reduce the damping of the resonance yielding a higher modulation depth [70]. Similarly, Shaner et al demonstrated tunable EOT in mid-infrared regime by incorporating electrically tunable n-doped GaAs beneath the metal gratings, as shown in Fig. 10(c). Figure.10(d) shows normalized transmission and shift of 25 cm−1 in its spectral position when the current is tuned from 0 to 200 mA. Moreover, trans- mission strength and linewidth remain stable for high current values which makes the use of such device as tunable mid-IR optical components [71]. Some other studies have revealed the scope of voltage-tunable graphene nanoribbons (GPRs) for spectral mod- ulation of the transmission signal in the THz regime. Kim et al demonstrated efficiency and spectral modulation of transmitted light from EOT structure coupled to graphene plasmonic ribbons, as shown in Fig.10(e). By varying the Fermi level EF of gaphene (or gate Voltage Vg) from −50 to −450 the normalized transmission become stronger and shift to higher energies. Moreover, the modulation efficiency (ηT ) (normalized trans- mission spectra with transmission spectrum obtained from bare GPRs device) shows narrow band features that become intense and shift to higher energies [see Fig.10(f)] [72, 73]. Electric-tunable graphene also enables the tuning of weak Raman signals for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) applications [74]. Apart from electric control, spectral modulation in the transmission resonances in NIR region has also been demonstrated through an externally applied magnetic field. Battula et al inves- tigated the blueshift in transmission with the increase in the magnitude of magnetic field [75]. These studies suggested that electro-optic modulation of plasmon-based pho-   tonic devices makes them highly compatible systems to leverage CMOS technology and fabricate hybrid devices for PIC. For instance, the combination of graphene with the silicon on insulators (SOI) platforms offers low cost and large-scale production in contrast to simple silicon-based optical modulators which restrain from low efficiency and speed. One such device is proposed by Wu et al as an efficient light modulator for photonic integrated circuits, as shown in Fig.11(a). The study demonstrates high- efficiency graphene–silicon hybrid-integrated modulators (cross-sectional view of the device is shown in Fig.11(b,c), leveraging gold-assisted transfer to achieve clean inter- faces and low contact resistance. The thermo-optic (TO) modulator exhibits a tuning efficiency of 0.037nm/mW, a compact active area of 7.54µm2, and rapid response times [see Fig.11(d)]. While the electro-absorption (EA) modulator achieves a bandwidth of 26.8 GHz, a data rate of 56 Gb/s, energy consumption as low as 200 fJ/bit and faster switching time (ns) due to high mobility of graphene [76]. In another study, Hu et al proposed a multi-parameter optical modulator to tune optical signal amplitude, wavelength and phase simultaneously in PIC for various applications. Figure.11(f) demonstrate the schematic of hybrid silicon-dielectric-graphene-metal grating device. The SPPs modes excited on gratings propagates along the surface of graphene attached to external bias voltage. The change in the Fermi-level of graphene induce a significant increase in mode intensity. Also the wavelength of SPP redshifts when the Fermi-level of graphene changes from 0.3eV - 0.9 eV [77]. Multi-parameter modulation in hybrid silicon-graphene photonic circuits provides on-chip active tuning of several compo- nents in PIC and outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in speed, efficiency, and power consumption, making them highly promising for CMOS-compatible, large-scale integrated photonic systems. To get more insight on the role of dielectrics in EOT, we will explicitly discuss some recent studies suggesting broadband EOT resonance and its tunability through dielectric metasurfaces in the following section.   4.1 Extraordinary optical transmission from dielectric   metasurfaces   Since its discovery in metal films, extraordinary optical transmission have been a corner stone of nanophotonics and subwavelength optics. While initial studies of EOT focused on metallic structures leveraging surface plasmon polaritons, recent advancements have demonstrated that dielectrics films also support EOT through fundamentally different mechanisms. Unlike metals, dielectric materials such as sili- con and silicon dioxide (SiO2) exhibit lower losses, higher stability, and compatibility with existing semiconductor fabrication techniques, making them promising candi- dates for mid-infrared (MIR) photonic applications. In contrast to surface plasmon polaritons attributed to enhanced transmission in metal films, EOT from dielectrics is governed by the excitation of surface phonon-polaritons (SPP) which yields transmis- sion resonances in the infrared regime. Recently, Chen et al demonstrated that EOT occurs from thin SiO2 film perforated with subwavelength hole. Figures.12(a) and 12(b) shows experimental and simulated normalized transmission spectra from 1µm SiO2 film, insets show the sample structures. The SPP resonances in SiO2 only occur over a finite range of frequencies around 9µm and 21µm The position of transmission resonance at certain points close to SPP frequencies indicates the strong involvement",

Due to delicious taste and unique body shape, the catch of this \u0000sh in the South\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nChina Sea has been increasing year by year. It is urgent to evaluate the population status of D. hystrix in the South China Sea. Molecular markers are often\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nused to evaluate the population status, but it has been a lack of relevant molecular markers for D. hystrix. In this study, we utilized the Illumina sequencing\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nplatform to generate transcriptome data to identify SNPs in D. hystrix muscle tissue. A total of 7.2 Mb clean reads with 94.92% Q20 bases were obtained, and\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n4,179 putative SNPs distributed among 22,618 genes were identi\u0000ed and con\u0000rmed. Randomly selected SNPs were validated, and 19 true SNPs (39.58%) were\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nscreened. We used these true SNP loci to verify the genetic diversity and population structure of a wild population of D. hystrix. The results showed that 18\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nSNP loci were polymorphic. The average PIC, Ne, Ho and He were 0.3354, 1.7893, 0.4963 and 0.4391, respectively. 14 SNP loci were consistent with Hardy-\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nWeinberg equilibrium (HWE), which revealed that the population was in a genetically stable state. The haplotype network concluded that the population may\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nbe composed of two different clades. In conclusion, the transcriptomic sequencing can quickly obtain the SNP loci as molecular markers which can be used\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nfor population genetic diversity and population structure analysis. It provides necessary help for the conservation biology and resource evaluation of D. hystrix.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.8**\nIntroduction\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nDiodon hystrix, the spot-\u0000n porcupine \u0000sh, is a member of the Diodontidae family and is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical marine environments\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n(Leis JM, 2006). D. hystrix has the same easily recognizable biological characteristics as puffer\u0000sh (Takifugu sp., Tetraodontidae family), such as an in\u0000ated\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nbody and spiny skin. Some countries and regions catch the porcupine \u0000sh for making dry crafts to sell to tourists, or showing in private and public aquariums.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nAlthough some reports indicate that porcupine \u0000sh are toxic, its meat is eaten by people living along the coast of the South China Sea. Until now, D. hystrix has\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nbeen listed as a species of least concern (LC) in the red list of threaded animals (IUCN 2015), but in fact, the biomass of this \u0000sh in the South China Sea has\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.8**\nbeen rapidly decreasing.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nRecently, signi\u0000cant technical advancements have provided innovative molecular genetic tools for studying aquaculture species (Hauser L, 2008; Milano I,\n2011). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are widely used in genetic diversity research, genetic linkage map construction, quantitative trait loci (QTL)\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nmapping, genome-wide association study (GWAS), and genomic selection (GS) because of their abundance and stability in genomes and transcriptomes (You\nX, 2020). Generally, when considering the marker density and genome coverage of SNP markers, the distribution of SNPs among unigenes is crucial, especially\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nwhen they are used for genetic mapping. Meanwhile, large sets of SNPs have also been reported in some aquaculture species, such as in the genus\nAustrolebias (García G, 2019), and the species Litopenaeus vannamei (Lu X, 2018), Hyriopsis cumingii (Zhang A, 2016), the Eastern oyster (Quilang J, 2007),\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nCtenopharyngodon idella (Liao Z, 2017), and Acipenser schrenckii (Li S, 2018) and some Takifugu species (Cui J, 2014; Jin W, 2015). These reported SNPs are\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nmainly centered on economic traits, including tolerance to various environmental stressors, disease resistance, sexual determination, and growth rate (Xiao S,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.4**\n2015; Yu H, 2016; Wang X, 2019). Nevertheless, the SNPs of D. hystrix has not yet been reported.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nThe large-scale discovery of molecular markers of D. hystrix is the basic work for reserving germplasm resources, constructing genetic analysis, and\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ndeveloping molecular genetic breeding technology. In view the conservation status and the intention of improving the breeding of this species, we describe a\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nlarge set of SNPs obtained by the transcriptome sequencing of D. hystrix in this study. These SNPs should re\u0000ect information concerning economically\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.6**\nrelevant traits for future molecular-assisted breeding.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.7**\nMaterials And Methods\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.6**\nSample collection and RNA isolation\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe spot-\u0000n porcupine \u0000sh (length 20 cm) was captured from the South China Sea in Sanya, Hainan province, China. Later, the muscle tissues were collected,\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80˚C before RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted from muscle tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Simms D,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n1993) and further puri\u0000ed using the RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Beltrame C, 2015). The quantity and quality of total RNA were\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nmeasured and recorded using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Panaro NJ, 2000). All treatment procedures for \u0000sh during this study were conducted in\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\naccordance with the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee and were approved by the review committee of BGI bioethics and biosafety.\nTranscriptome Sequencing and Reads Collection\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nUsing the criteria of paired-end 150 bp reads, the transcriptome libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 platform (San Diego, CA, USA). To\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nbetter assemble the whole transcriptome de novo, a paired end (PE) sequencing strategy was used. Subsequently, the clean reads from D. hystrix\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ntranscriptome were de novo assembled using Trinity package and the assembled sequence from the transcriptome data was used as reference in this study.\nFirstly, the obtained raw reads from D. hystrix were treated using SOAPdenovo (https://github.com/BGI-\u0000exlab/SOAP) to remove the junk reads with adapters,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nreads with more than 5% unknown nucleotides, and low-quality scores (Q20). The clean reads were then de novo assembled into contigs and unigenes using\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthe Trinity package, with the parameters set to “min_contig_length 150 --min_kmer_cov 3 --min_glue 3 --b\u0000y_opts '-V 5 --edge-thr = 0.1 –stderr”. Then, the clean\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nsequences were then mapped back to contigs. Ultimately, we obtained unigenes (more than 150 nucleotides), which were clustered using TGICL (default\nparameters) (Pertea G, 2003) to reduce redundancy.\nSNP Detection\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nPotential SNP variations were predicted by combining two tools, BWA for mapping and GATK for variant calling. Short reads of the D. hystrix transcriptome\nwas mapped to the reference using BWA version 0.5.9 (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) by the default settings except for no gap tolerance. There are many\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\navailable calling software programs, GATK and SAMtools are currently the most popular SNP discovery tools. In this study, raw vcf \u0000les were \u0000ltered using\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.0**t== 1.0**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nGATK version 3.4 with the parameter settings “stand_call_conf 20.0 -stand_emit_conf 20.0 -window 35 -cluster 3 -FS > 30.0 QD < 5.0” except for no gap\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ntolerance (De Summa S, 2017). The high-quality SNPs were required to meet the requirements of quality score greater than 20 and read depth measured over\n10. Since the prediction accuracy of SNPs depends on sequence coverage, both SNPs and indels were considered to be true polymorphisms, when each allele\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.4**\nwas observed at least three times.\nAnalysis of genetic diversity and population structure\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nTo validate the SNPs from RNA-Seq, we used the software Primer 3 (http://primer3.ut.ee/) to design a number of primers which could amplify the \u0000anking\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nsequence of randomly selected SNP loci. The genome DNA of D. hystrix was used to detect these SNP loci, and the positive PCR was as basis for preliminary\nscreening of SNP loci. A true SNP locus usually has nucleotide transversion or transition. So, a wild group of D. hystrix (30 individuals) was used as templates\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.2**\nfor validating these screened SNP loci. The positive PCR products on these screened SNP loci were sequenced by BGI-Guangzhou.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nIn sequencing peak map, the homozygous SNP loci are single peaks, whereas heterozygous SNP loci are double peaks. Homozygotes were recorded as AA\nand BB respectively, and heterozygotes were recorded as AB. The effective number of alleles (Ne), expected heterozygosity (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho),\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nand minimum allele frequency (MAF) were analyzed by Arlequin (version 3.5.2.2) software (Exco\u0000er L, 2010). In addition, the Arlequin software was also used\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nto analyze the linkage disequilibrium among different SNP loci. The PIC_CALC (version 0.6, https://github.com/luansheng/PIC_CALC) was used to calculate\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthe polymorphism information content (PIC) of SNPs. The Genepop (version 4.5.1) (François Rousset, 2008) was used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\n(HWE).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nThe genotypes of different SNP loci of each individual were used to compose the SNP feature sequences. These SNP feature sequences were used to\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.2**\nconstruct the haplotype networkby DNASP (version 6) and NETWORK (version 10.2) (Rozas J, 2017; Tobias Polzin, 2003).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.9**\nResults\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.4**\nTranscriptome sequencing and de novo assembly\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nA total of 7.74 Mb paired-end raw reads were generated from the D. hystrix muscle. Raw reads of separated individuals were deposited in the ENA (European\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nNucleotide Archive) public database (Accession: PRJEB47595). After removing the adapter sequences and low-complexity reads, a total of 7.2 Mb of clean\nreads was obtained. The Q20 and Q30 values were 94.9% and 88.7%, respectively (Table 1). The GC percentage of the transcriptome was 47.0%. The high-\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nquality reads were then assembled into 29,272 contigs from the short reads.

To obtain more reliable SNPs, high-quality SNPs were de\u0000ned as those with a quality score over\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n20 and a read depth over 10. As predicted from the muscle transcriptome, there are 4,179 high-quality SNPs. Among the detected SNPs, the transition sites are\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n2856 (68.34%), while the transversion sites are 1323 (31.66%). The ratio of transition to transversion is 2.16. In these transition sites, the highest proportions\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nare G/A (752, 17.99%) and C/T (737, 17.64%). In these transversion sites, the highest proportions are A/C (185, 4.43%) and C/A (181, 4.33%), while the C/G\n(145, 3.47%) is the lowest proportion (Table 3). SNP distribution among unigenes signi\u0000cantly matters in the consideration of the marker density and genome\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ncoverage with the usage of SNP markers, especially when SNPs are used for linkage map construction. In this study, we found that all the SNPs were\ndistributed in 2,270 unigenes (10.04% of the total number of unigenes). The unigenes with a single SNP were common (occupied 34.0% of all SNPs), and\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthose with no more than 10 SNPs occupied 95.14% of all SNPs. A total of 19 unigenes containing over 10 SNPs were observed. The detailed SNP distribution\namong those unigenes is indicated in Fig. 2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.8**\nSNP type\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.7**\nTransition\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nTransversion\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.8**\nNumber\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nPercentage%\n**BLOCK**fs== 14.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.8**\nSNP screening\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nAs the SNPs reported in the present study were identi\u0000ed through RNA-Seq analysis, the SNPs needed further validation. A total of 103 SNP loci were randomly\nselected from 4,179 predicted SNPs, and the primers were obtained under the default stringency conditions of the Primer3 software. By optimizing the PCR\nreaction conditions, 48 pairs of primers could amplify the target sequences. Within these ampli\u0000ed sequences, 19 SNP loci (682, 698, 1569, 5491, 5649, 5921,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n7808, 10659, 12102, 12374, 12683, 14194, 14788, 15840, 18877, 19192, CL351, CL439, and CL552) were effectively screened (these primers were listed in the\nTable S1). The estimated prediction accuracy of SNPs reached 39.58%.\nPolymorphism analysis of SNP\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe genomic DNA from 30 wild individuals of D. hystrix was detected by these primers of 19 SNP loci. The results showed that one locus (5649) contained\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthree alleles (A, T, and G) in each sample did not conform to the feature of diploid, and the remaining 18 SNP loci contained two alleles (see Table 4). Expected\nheterozygosity (He) is often used to measure the genetic diversity of populations. In this wild population, average observed heterozygosity (Ho) was 0.4963,\nand average expected heterozygosity (He) was 0.4391; Minor allele frequency (MAF) is actually the second most frequent allele in the population, which is\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nmainly used to distinguish whether an allele is a common polymorphism or a rare variation. The distribution range of MAF of 18 SNP loci was 0.1167-0.5000,\nwhich was greater than 0.05, indicating that these loci belong to common polymorphisms. Polymorphism information content (PIC) is used to indicate the\ndegree of polymorphism at a certain locus in a population. The average PIC of this wild population was 0.3354, one locus (12102) belonged to low\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\npolymorphism (PIC < 0.25), and others belonged to moderate polymorphism (0.25 < PIC < 0.5). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test showed that 4 loci (5921,\n15840, 18877, and CL351) did not accord with HWE (P < 0.05), and 2 loci (15840 and CL351) seriously did not accord with HWE (P < 0.01). These results of\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.2**\npolymorphism analysis showed that 18 SNP loci (excepted 5649) could be used for the genetic analysis of Diodon hystrix.\nLinkage disequilibrium analysis of SNP\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nLinkage disequilibrium (LD) is used to evaluate the phenomenon that the alleles at different loci appearing on the same chromosome is frequently higher than\nthat of random association. In this study, it was found that locus 12102 was linked to 12374, 14194 and 15840, respectively (p < 0.05), locus 12102 and\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n14194 were signi\u0000cant linkage (p = 0.0059); SNP locus 5921 was linked to 15840 and CL351, respectively (P < 0.05); In addition, there was a very signi\u0000cant\nlinkage between locus 15840 and CL351 (p = 0.0000, see Table 5).\nSNP for population genetic structure analysis\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe loci deviating from HWE are not suitable to investigate the genetic stability of the population. Therefore, we recombined the SNP feature sequences by\nusing the genotypes of 14 SNP loci conforming to HWE. 30 individuals were formed 30 haplotypes. Haplotype network analysis divided these 30 haplotypes\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ninto two clades. One small clade contained 8 haplotypes (m15, m19, m21, m23-025, m28 and m29), and the other big clade contained 22 haplotypes (m1-14,\nm16-18, m20, m22, m26-27 and m30). The big clade included four small branches, which respectively composed by 6 (m2, m6, m10, m13, m16 and m20), 5\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.3**\n(m3, m7, m11, m12 and m18), 6 (m1, m5, m8, m17, m27 and m30), 3 (m4, m14 and m26) haplotypes (Fig. 4).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nUnigene ID\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.5**\nFrequency\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene682_Control_1_74\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene698_Control_1_613\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene1569_Control_1_272\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene5491_Control_1_445\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene5649_Control_1_411\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene5921_Control_1_120\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene7808_Control_1_197\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene10659_Control_1_2585\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene12102_Control_1_559\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene12374_Control_1_331\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene12683_Control_1_275\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene14194_Control_1_317\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene14788_Control_1_551\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene15840_Control_1_289\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene18877_Control_1_246\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nUnigene19192_Control_1_347\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nCL351.Contig1_Control_1_802\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nCL439.Contig1_Control_1_588\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nCL552.Contig2_Control_1_560\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.9**\nAverage\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nTransition frequency\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nTransversion frequency\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\nTheta_S\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nSubstitution frequency\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\ns.d.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA-Seq can be\nused to study individual differences, gene function, and evolutionary history (Werner T, 2010; Martin JA, 2011). However, WGS is more costly in terms of\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nexpense and computing resources than RNA-Seq, and it cannot directly obtain the comprehensive information included in transcriptomes through functional\nprediction (Chou C-H, 2018). A more effective strategy is to use RNA-seq \u0000rst to clarify the molecular bases of biological functions. Owing to the economic\nimportance of many aquatic species, it is necessary to establish a complete transcriptome resource database, and this can be done despite the lack of\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ngenomes for non-model species. In addition, RNA-Seq is also an e\u0000cient and cost-effective method to comprehensively identify SNPs from transcribed\nregions in the genomes of aquaculture species. In this study, the transcriptome was generated using the Illumina HiSeq platform to identify SNPs in D. hystrix.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nA total of 4,179 putative SNPs distributed among 2,270 unigenes were identi\u0000ed. Among these, the number of transition SNP loci (A/G and C/T) was\nsigni\u0000cantly greater than that of transversion SNP loci (A/T, A/C, G/T, and C/G; Table 3), which is similar to the \u0000ndings of other studies such as in Acipenser\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nschrenckii (Li S, 2018), Litopenaeus vannamei (Lu X, 2018), and Piaractus mesopotamicus (Mastrochirico-Filho VA, 2016). These large sets of SNPs were\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nobtained from the D. hystrix transcriptome sequencing, and then 19 available SNP loci were screened from 48 ampli\u0000ed loci, and the predicted accuracy of\nSNP loci was 39.58%. It indicated that tissue-speci\u0000c transcriptome sequencing was one of the important ways to e\u0000ciently screen available SNP loci.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nPolymorphism is the genetic diversity among different populations within a species or among different individuals within a population. It is the foundation for\nmaintaining the evolution of species, and is also closely related to the formation, disappearance and development of biodiversity. In this study, we used 18\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\navailable SNP loci (excluding 5649 locus) to analyze the polymorphism of wild population of D. hystrix. Expected heterozygosity (He) indicated the genetic\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ndiversity of this population was at a moderately low level, which may be caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of individual loci (such as 12102 and\nCL552) in the population. In addition, the average PIC of 18 SNP loci was generally low, which was consistent with the result of He. Remarkably, SNP locus\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\n(5649) often appeared the triploid in population (each individual contained three alleles, such as A, T, or G). We have not eliminated this phenomenon by\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nimproving experimental methods, eliminating sample pollution and improving primer speci\u0000city. Therefore, we speculate that there are two possibilities on this\nlocus: (1) the gene of this locus is a multi-copy gene in this species; (2) the chromosome of this species has a doubling phenomenon in the evolution. These\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.7**\ninferences need to be veri\u0000ed in the future.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nIn a stable population, the frequency of alleles and genes are balanced in generation heredity. The results of HWE showed that four loci (5921, 15840, 18877\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nand CL351) signi\u0000cantly deviated from the balance, while other loci (except 5649) were well to comply with Mendel's law of inheritance. It indicated that the\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\npopulation of D. hystrix in the South China Sea was still in a relatively stable state under high \u0000shing intensity. Interestingly, the other three loci (5921, 15840\nand CL351) deviated from HWE have linkage disequilibrium. These linkage disequilibrium loci lead to a serious difference between the actual frequency and\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nexpected frequency of two genes at different loci, which indicated that the genes corresponding to these loci may be located on the same chromosome or\nclose to each other. This suggested that we should be more attention to the effect of linkage disequilibrium genes on HWE in the population diversity analysis.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nWe also analyzed the population structure of this wild population of D. hystrixHaplotype analysis divided this wild population into 30 haplotypes, which may\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nbe attributed to too many SNP loci or insu\u0000cient number of samples. However, it does not affect the construction of haplotype network for this wild\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\npopulation. Haplotype network analysis revealed that the wild population of D. hystrix in the South China Sea may be composed of two different clades.\nClade1 had more haplotypes and branches, it suggested that the clade1 was higher polymorphism than clade2. Theoretically, these haplotypes in clade1 have\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.4**\nstronger adaptability, but it still needs to be further veri\u0000ed by increasing the number of samples.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.9**\nConclusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nIn this study, the high-throughput sequencing reads from muscle tissue transcriptomes of D. hystrix were used to detect SNPs.

The available SNP loci were used to analyze the genetic diversity and\npopulation structure of the wild population of D. hystrix in the South China Sea. The genetic diversity of the wild population was at moderately low level.

Due to delicious taste and unique body shape, the catch of this \u0000sh in the South   China Sea has been increasing year by year. It is urgent to evaluate the population status of D. hystrix in the South China Sea. Molecular markers are often   used to evaluate the population status, but it has been a lack of relevant molecular markers for D. hystrix. In this study, we utilized the Illumina sequencing   platform to generate transcriptome data to identify SNPs in D. hystrix muscle tissue. A total of 7.2 Mb clean reads with 94.92% Q20 bases were obtained, and   4,179 putative SNPs distributed among 22,618 genes were identi\u0000ed and con\u0000rmed. Randomly selected SNPs were validated, and 19 true SNPs (39.58%) were   screened. We used these true SNP loci to verify the genetic diversity and population structure of a wild population of D. hystrix. The results showed that 18   SNP loci were polymorphic. The average PIC, Ne, Ho and He were 0.3354, 1.7893, 0.4963 and 0.4391, respectively. 14 SNP loci were consistent with Hardy-   Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), which revealed that the population was in a genetically stable state. The haplotype network concluded that the population may   be composed of two different clades. In conclusion, the transcriptomic sequencing can quickly obtain the SNP loci as molecular markers which can be used   for population genetic diversity and population structure analysis. It provides necessary help for the conservation biology and resource evaluation of D. hystrix.   Diodon hystrix, the spot-\u0000n porcupine \u0000sh, is a member of the Diodontidae family and is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical marine environments   (Leis JM, 2006). D. hystrix has the same easily recognizable biological characteristics as puffer\u0000sh (Takifugu sp., Tetraodontidae family), such as an in\u0000ated   body and spiny skin. Some countries and regions catch the porcupine \u0000sh for making dry crafts to sell to tourists, or showing in private and public aquariums.   Although some reports indicate that porcupine \u0000sh are toxic, its meat is eaten by people living along the coast of the South China Sea. Until now, D. hystrix has   been listed as a species of least concern (LC) in the red list of threaded animals (IUCN 2015), but in fact, the biomass of this \u0000sh in the South China Sea has   been rapidly decreasing.   Recently, signi\u0000cant technical advancements have provided innovative molecular genetic tools for studying aquaculture species (Hauser L, 2008; Milano I, 2011). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are widely used in genetic diversity research, genetic linkage map construction, quantitative trait loci (QTL)   mapping, genome-wide association study (GWAS), and genomic selection (GS) because of their abundance and stability in genomes and transcriptomes (You X, 2020). Generally, when considering the marker density and genome coverage of SNP markers, the distribution of SNPs among unigenes is crucial, especially   when they are used for genetic mapping. Meanwhile, large sets of SNPs have also been reported in some aquaculture species, such as in the genus Austrolebias (García G, 2019), and the species Litopenaeus vannamei (Lu X, 2018), Hyriopsis cumingii (Zhang A, 2016), the Eastern oyster (Quilang J, 2007),   Ctenopharyngodon idella (Liao Z, 2017), and Acipenser schrenckii (Li S, 2018) and some Takifugu species (Cui J, 2014; Jin W, 2015). These reported SNPs are   mainly centered on economic traits, including tolerance to various environmental stressors, disease resistance, sexual determination, and growth rate (Xiao S,   2015; Yu H, 2016; Wang X, 2019). Nevertheless, the SNPs of D. hystrix has not yet been reported.   The large-scale discovery of molecular markers of D. hystrix is the basic work for reserving germplasm resources, constructing genetic analysis, and   developing molecular genetic breeding technology. In view the conservation status and the intention of improving the breeding of this species, we describe a   large set of SNPs obtained by the transcriptome sequencing of D. hystrix in this study. These SNPs should re\u0000ect information concerning economically   relevant traits for future molecular-assisted breeding.   Sample collection and RNA isolation   The spot-\u0000n porcupine \u0000sh (length 20 cm) was captured from the South China Sea in Sanya, Hainan province, China. Later, the muscle tissues were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80˚C before RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted from muscle tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Simms D,   1993) and further puri\u0000ed using the RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Beltrame C, 2015). The quantity and quality of total RNA were   measured and recorded using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Panaro NJ, 2000). All treatment procedures for \u0000sh during this study were conducted in   accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee and were approved by the review committee of BGI bioethics and biosafety. Transcriptome Sequencing and Reads Collection   Using the criteria of paired-end 150 bp reads, the transcriptome libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 platform (San Diego, CA, USA). To   better assemble the whole transcriptome de novo, a paired end (PE) sequencing strategy was used. Subsequently, the clean reads from D. hystrix   transcriptome were de novo assembled using Trinity package and the assembled sequence from the transcriptome data was used as reference in this study. Firstly, the obtained raw reads from D. hystrix were treated using SOAPdenovo (https://github.com/BGI-\u0000exlab/SOAP) to remove the junk reads with adapters,   reads with more than 5% unknown nucleotides, and low-quality scores (Q20). The clean reads were then de novo assembled into contigs and unigenes using   the Trinity package, with the parameters set to “min_contig_length 150 --min_kmer_cov 3 --min_glue 3 --b\u0000y_opts '-V 5 --edge-thr = 0.1 –stderr”. Then, the clean   sequences were then mapped back to contigs. Ultimately, we obtained unigenes (more than 150 nucleotides), which were clustered using TGICL (default parameters) (Pertea G, 2003) to reduce redundancy. SNP Detection   Potential SNP variations were predicted by combining two tools, BWA for mapping and GATK for variant calling. Short reads of the D. hystrix transcriptome was mapped to the reference using BWA version 0.5.9 (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) by the default settings except for no gap tolerance. There are many   available calling software programs, GATK and SAMtools are currently the most popular SNP discovery tools. In this study, raw vcf \u0000les were \u0000ltered using   GATK version 3.4 with the parameter settings “stand_call_conf 20.0 -stand_emit_conf 20.0 -window 35 -cluster 3 -FS > 30.0 QD < 5.0” except for no gap   tolerance (De Summa S, 2017). The high-quality SNPs were required to meet the requirements of quality score greater than 20 and read depth measured over 10. Since the prediction accuracy of SNPs depends on sequence coverage, both SNPs and indels were considered to be true polymorphisms, when each allele   was observed at least three times. Analysis of genetic diversity and population structure   To validate the SNPs from RNA-Seq, we used the software Primer 3 (http://primer3.ut.ee/) to design a number of primers which could amplify the \u0000anking   sequence of randomly selected SNP loci. The genome DNA of D. hystrix was used to detect these SNP loci, and the positive PCR was as basis for preliminary screening of SNP loci. A true SNP locus usually has nucleotide transversion or transition. So, a wild group of D. hystrix (30 individuals) was used as templates   for validating these screened SNP loci. The positive PCR products on these screened SNP loci were sequenced by BGI-Guangzhou.   In sequencing peak map, the homozygous SNP loci are single peaks, whereas heterozygous SNP loci are double peaks. Homozygotes were recorded as AA and BB respectively, and heterozygotes were recorded as AB. The effective number of alleles (Ne), expected heterozygosity (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho),   and minimum allele frequency (MAF) were analyzed by Arlequin (version 3.5.2.2) software (Exco\u0000er L, 2010). In addition, the Arlequin software was also used   to analyze the linkage disequilibrium among different SNP loci. The PIC_CALC (version 0.6, https://github.com/luansheng/PIC_CALC) was used to calculate   the polymorphism information content (PIC) of SNPs. The Genepop (version 4.5.1) (François Rousset, 2008) was used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).   The genotypes of different SNP loci of each individual were used to compose the SNP feature sequences. These SNP feature sequences were used to   construct the haplotype networkby DNASP (version 6) and NETWORK (version 10.2) (Rozas J, 2017; Tobias Polzin, 2003).   Transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly   A total of 7.74 Mb paired-end raw reads were generated from the D. hystrix muscle. Raw reads of separated individuals were deposited in the ENA (European   Nucleotide Archive) public database (Accession: PRJEB47595). After removing the adapter sequences and low-complexity reads, a total of 7.2 Mb of clean reads was obtained. The Q20 and Q30 values were 94.9% and 88.7%, respectively (Table 1). The GC percentage of the transcriptome was 47.0%. The high-   quality reads were then assembled into 29,272 contigs from the short reads. These redundant contigs were further clustered into 22,618 unigenes with the N50   size of 975 bp (Table 2). The length distributions of these assembled unigenes are shown in Fig. 1.   Table 1 The information of RNA-Seq reads   Insert Size (bp)   Raw data   Clean data   Table 2 The information of assembled unigenes   Total Length (bp) Mean Length (bp)   The alignment \u0000le was used for SNP detection by using GATK. To obtain more reliable SNPs, high-quality SNPs were de\u0000ned as those with a quality score over   20 and a read depth over 10. As predicted from the muscle transcriptome, there are 4,179 high-quality SNPs. Among the detected SNPs, the transition sites are   2856 (68.34%), while the transversion sites are 1323 (31.66%). The ratio of transition to transversion is 2.16. In these transition sites, the highest proportions   are G/A (752, 17.99%) and C/T (737, 17.64%). In these transversion sites, the highest proportions are A/C (185, 4.43%) and C/A (181, 4.33%), while the C/G (145, 3.47%) is the lowest proportion (Table 3). SNP distribution among unigenes signi\u0000cantly matters in the consideration of the marker density and genome   coverage with the usage of SNP markers, especially when SNPs are used for linkage map construction. In this study, we found that all the SNPs were distributed in 2,270 unigenes (10.04% of the total number of unigenes). The unigenes with a single SNP were common (occupied 34.0% of all SNPs), and   those with no more than 10 SNPs occupied 95.14% of all SNPs. A total of 19 unigenes containing over 10 SNPs were observed. The detailed SNP distribution among those unigenes is indicated in Fig. 2.   SNP type   SNP screening   As the SNPs reported in the present study were identi\u0000ed through RNA-Seq analysis, the SNPs needed further validation. A total of 103 SNP loci were randomly selected from 4,179 predicted SNPs, and the primers were obtained under the default stringency conditions of the Primer3 software. By optimizing the PCR reaction conditions, 48 pairs of primers could amplify the target sequences. Within these ampli\u0000ed sequences, 19 SNP loci (682, 698, 1569, 5491, 5649, 5921,   7808, 10659, 12102, 12374, 12683, 14194, 14788, 15840, 18877, 19192, CL351, CL439, and CL552) were effectively screened (these primers were listed in the Table S1). The estimated prediction accuracy of SNPs reached 39.58%. Polymorphism analysis of SNP   The genomic DNA from 30 wild individuals of D. hystrix was detected by these primers of 19 SNP loci. The results showed that one locus (5649) contained   three alleles (A, T, and G) in each sample did not conform to the feature of diploid, and the remaining 18 SNP loci contained two alleles (see Table 4). Expected heterozygosity (He) is often used to measure the genetic diversity of populations. In this wild population, average observed heterozygosity (Ho) was 0.4963, and average expected heterozygosity (He) was 0.4391; Minor allele frequency (MAF) is actually the second most frequent allele in the population, which is   mainly used to distinguish whether an allele is a common polymorphism or a rare variation. The distribution range of MAF of 18 SNP loci was 0.1167-0.5000, which was greater than 0.05, indicating that these loci belong to common polymorphisms. Polymorphism information content (PIC) is used to indicate the degree of polymorphism at a certain locus in a population. The average PIC of this wild population was 0.3354, one locus (12102) belonged to low   polymorphism (PIC < 0.25), and others belonged to moderate polymorphism (0.25 < PIC < 0.5). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test showed that 4 loci (5921, 15840, 18877, and CL351) did not accord with HWE (P < 0.05), and 2 loci (15840 and CL351) seriously did not accord with HWE (P < 0.01). These results of   polymorphism analysis showed that 18 SNP loci (excepted 5649) could be used for the genetic analysis of Diodon hystrix. Linkage disequilibrium analysis of SNP   Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is used to evaluate the phenomenon that the alleles at different loci appearing on the same chromosome is frequently higher than that of random association. In this study, it was found that locus 12102 was linked to 12374, 14194 and 15840, respectively (p < 0.05), locus 12102 and   14194 were signi\u0000cant linkage (p = 0.0059); SNP locus 5921 was linked to 15840 and CL351, respectively (P < 0.05); In addition, there was a very signi\u0000cant linkage between locus 15840 and CL351 (p = 0.0000, see Table 5). SNP for population genetic structure analysis   The loci deviating from HWE are not suitable to investigate the genetic stability of the population. Therefore, we recombined the SNP feature sequences by using the genotypes of 14 SNP loci conforming to HWE. 30 individuals were formed 30 haplotypes. Haplotype network analysis divided these 30 haplotypes   into two clades. One small clade contained 8 haplotypes (m15, m19, m21, m23-025, m28 and m29), and the other big clade contained 22 haplotypes (m1-14, m16-18, m20, m22, m26-27 and m30). The big clade included four small branches, which respectively composed by 6 (m2, m6, m10, m13, m16 and m20), 5   (m3, m7, m11, m12 and m18), 6 (m1, m5, m8, m17, m27 and m30), 3 (m4, m14 and m26) haplotypes (Fig. 4).

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA-Seq can be used to study individual differences, gene function, and evolutionary history (Werner T, 2010; Martin JA, 2011). However, WGS is more costly in terms of   expense and computing resources than RNA-Seq, and it cannot directly obtain the comprehensive information included in transcriptomes through functional prediction (Chou C-H, 2018). A more effective strategy is to use RNA-seq \u0000rst to clarify the molecular bases of biological functions. Owing to the economic importance of many aquatic species, it is necessary to establish a complete transcriptome resource database, and this can be done despite the lack of   genomes for non-model species. In addition, RNA-Seq is also an e\u0000cient and cost-effective method to comprehensively identify SNPs from transcribed regions in the genomes of aquaculture species. In this study, the transcriptome was generated using the Illumina HiSeq platform to identify SNPs in D. hystrix.   A total of 4,179 putative SNPs distributed among 2,270 unigenes were identi\u0000ed. Among these, the number of transition SNP loci (A/G and C/T) was signi\u0000cantly greater than that of transversion SNP loci (A/T, A/C, G/T, and C/G; Table 3), which is similar to the \u0000ndings of other studies such as in Acipenser   schrenckii (Li S, 2018), Litopenaeus vannamei (Lu X, 2018), and Piaractus mesopotamicus (Mastrochirico-Filho VA, 2016). These large sets of SNPs were   obtained from the D. hystrix transcriptome sequencing, and then 19 available SNP loci were screened from 48 ampli\u0000ed loci, and the predicted accuracy of SNP loci was 39.58%. It indicated that tissue-speci\u0000c transcriptome sequencing was one of the important ways to e\u0000ciently screen available SNP loci.   Polymorphism is the genetic diversity among different populations within a species or among different individuals within a population. It is the foundation for maintaining the evolution of species, and is also closely related to the formation, disappearance and development of biodiversity. In this study, we used 18   available SNP loci (excluding 5649 locus) to analyze the polymorphism of wild population of D. hystrix. Expected heterozygosity (He) indicated the genetic   diversity of this population was at a moderately low level, which may be caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of individual loci (such as 12102 and CL552) in the population. In addition, the average PIC of 18 SNP loci was generally low, which was consistent with the result of He. Remarkably, SNP locus   (5649) often appeared the triploid in population (each individual contained three alleles, such as A, T, or G). We have not eliminated this phenomenon by   improving experimental methods, eliminating sample pollution and improving primer speci\u0000city. Therefore, we speculate that there are two possibilities on this locus: (1) the gene of this locus is a multi-copy gene in this species; (2) the chromosome of this species has a doubling phenomenon in the evolution. These   inferences need to be veri\u0000ed in the future.   In a stable population, the frequency of alleles and genes are balanced in generation heredity. The results of HWE showed that four loci (5921, 15840, 18877   and CL351) signi\u0000cantly deviated from the balance, while other loci (except 5649) were well to comply with Mendel's law of inheritance. It indicated that the   population of D. hystrix in the South China Sea was still in a relatively stable state under high \u0000shing intensity. Interestingly, the other three loci (5921, 15840 and CL351) deviated from HWE have linkage disequilibrium. These linkage disequilibrium loci lead to a serious difference between the actual frequency and   expected frequency of two genes at different loci, which indicated that the genes corresponding to these loci may be located on the same chromosome or close to each other. This suggested that we should be more attention to the effect of linkage disequilibrium genes on HWE in the population diversity analysis.   We also analyzed the population structure of this wild population of D. hystrixHaplotype analysis divided this wild population into 30 haplotypes, which may   be attributed to too many SNP loci or insu\u0000cient number of samples. However, it does not affect the construction of haplotype network for this wild   population. Haplotype network analysis revealed that the wild population of D. hystrix in the South China Sea may be composed of two different clades. Clade1 had more haplotypes and branches, it suggested that the clade1 was higher polymorphism than clade2. Theoretically, these haplotypes in clade1 have   stronger adaptability, but it still needs to be further veri\u0000ed by increasing the number of samples.   In this study, the high-throughput sequencing reads from muscle tissue transcriptomes of D. hystrix were used to detect SNPs. A total of 4,179 high-quality   SNPs were predicted. Within 48 ampli\u0000ed SNP loci, about half could be veri\u0000ed. The available SNP loci were used to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of the wild population of D. hystrix in the South China Sea. The genetic diversity of the wild population was at moderately low level. The   wild population may be composed of two relatively independent clades, and the diversity of one clade was signi\u0000cantly higher than that of the other. It   suggested that the genetic status of the wild population of D. hystrix in the South China Sea was still relatively stable, but its` population resources need to be attention to at all times. Overall, the SNPs predicted in this study will play a role in genetic diversity research and molecular-assisted breeding of D. hystrix.

         "BACKGROUND\nOne can assess cortical defects on the early images of [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 renography. We aimed to assess interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility for detecting renal cortical defects using [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 for adults and children; identify causes for poor inter- and intraobserver reproducibility and to assess the effect of the kidney to background ratio (KTBR) on reproducibility.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred adult and 200 pediatric renograms were included. The observers reviewed the summed 1-minute posterior images for the first four minutes to detect cortical defects. Interobserver reproducibility between three observers and intra-observer reproducibility for two observers were determined. Agreement was tested using percentage agreement, Krippendorff's reliability coefficient alpha and Cohen's kappa statistic. The association between KTBR and agreement was evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInterobserver agreement on the 1-2 minutes images was 78 (95% CI: 74.8-82.7%) and 79.7 (95% CI: 75.9-83.5%) for left and right kidneys respectively. Intraobserver percentage was 89.7% (95% CI: 86.2-93.1%) for the senior and 80.7% (95% CI: 76.2-85.2%) for the junior observer. In 13.5% (27) of the adult and 4.5% (19) of the pediatric kidneys the difference in image interpretation between the observers would have had a clinical impact. If the KTBR is ≤2, the percentage agreement was between 61.5% and 64.8%. In cases with a KTBR >2, the percentage agreement was between 83.6% and 87.1%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe percentage interobserver agreement was moderate. Disagreement between normal and abnormal cases were infrequent. The interobserver reproducibility was decreased when the KTBR was ≤2.",

One can assess cortical defects on the early images of [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 renography.  We aim to   assess interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility for detecting renal cortical defects using   [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 for adults and children; identify causes for poor inter- and intraobserver   reproducibility and to assess the effect of the kidney to background ratio (KTBR) on reproducibility.   A 100 adult and 200 paediatric renograms were included. The observers reviewed the summed 1-   min posterior images for the first four minutes to detect cortical defects.

Patel et al. evaluated   57 paediatric [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scans which were reported by two nuclear medicine physicians using   a standard set of criteria on two occasions to determine the interobserver and the intraobserver   variability in the scan interpretation. They excluded six scans due to motion artefacts or poor-   quality images. They reported high levels of interobserver (84.4%, p<0.05) and intraobserver   percentage agreement (95.9% and 90.6% respectively, p<0.05). The weighted kappa values for   intraobserver agreement were 0.8 - 0.9 for the first observer, 0.6 - 0.8 for the second observer and   A multicentre trial to assess the interobserver reproducibility in reporting [99mTc]Tc-DMSA planar   scintigraphy was conducted by De Sadeleer et al. in 2000. This study was conducted in Belgium by   42 nuclear medicine physicians who evaluated [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scans for 40 children and 10 adults.   The median percentage of agreement for overall interobserver reproducibility was 92%.

Three observers   independently evaluated the early scans alone, the late scans alone and both the early and late   scans together. This resulted in a complete interobserver agreement in 75%, 78%, and 77% for the   early scan, the late scan alone, and the late DMSA scan with the early scan for comparison,   respectively. Complete agreement was considered when all three observers agreed on a normal,   abnormal, or equivocal results. The total intraobserver agreement on the late scan alone and the   late scan in the presence of the early scan was observed in 96%, 89%, and 86% for observers 1, 2,   Gacinovic et al. found poor interobserver agreement for the presence or absence of renal scars on   [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scan. Seven experienced observers evaluated 32 kidneys on two separate   occasions. The population included ten patients who were under the age of ten years. The   interobserver agreement on the presence of scarring was poor; 51% on the first reading and 61%   Sixty paediatric [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scans were evaluated in 2009 by 61 observers to assess the   interobserver reproducibility of each kidney as normal, abnormal, or equivocal/poor quality. They   reported a median agreement of 93% and in 24% the agreement was less than 80%. In 13%   (16 kidneys) there was a disagreement between normal and abnormal which could have had a   clinical impact. The remaining differences were between normal and equivocal. Disagreement was   mainly in cases with normal variants, congenital abnormalities, and small defects (8).   [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 is a tubular agent used to assess renal function and drainage of the kidneys. The   extraction fraction of [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 is 40% to 50% (9). Most of the extracted [99mTc]Tc-MAG3   (96%) undergoes tubular secretion and 4% undergoes glomerular filtration (3). It is one of the   recommended tracers for renography in children under two years (10). [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 is also   preferred for renography in older patients with impaired renal function (11). The good cortical   uptake of [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 has led to the proposal that cortical defects can be assessed on the   In 1992, Gordon et al. studied 59 children, 110 kidneys, with previous urinary tract infections who   underwent both [99mTc]Tc-DMSA and [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 within four weeks of each other.

These patients had a [99mTc]Tc-DMSA and [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 scan   within a 3 to 7 day interval. The scans were reviewed independently and 17 of the 19 cortical   defects detected on the [99mTc]Tc-DMSA were identified on [99mTc]Tc-MAG3.  The sensitivity and   specificity of [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 for detecting cortical defects were 89% and 100% respectively (13).   The abnormal parenchymal findings on [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 renograms of 28 children who were   strongly suspected to have acute pyelonephritis were compared to subsequent planar [99mTc]Tc-   DMSA scans by two observers. The [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scans were performed within one week after   the renograms. They did not only use the early images of the [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 they also included   later clearance abnormalities as indicators of parenchymal dysfunction. Both scans showed focal   parenchymal abnormalities for 24 patients. In four patients [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 was considered   abnormal however, the corresponding DMSA scan was interpreted as normal.

The   first group interpreted the scans together, they agreed on the presence of cortical defects on   [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 in 14 patients. In one patient they did not agree on the presence of cortical   defects. Of the 14 patients with cortical defects on [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 five had normal [99mTc]Tc-DMSA   studies. A second group of readers interpreted the scans independently. They agreed on the   presence of cortical defects in ten and the absence of cortical defects in 32 patients. Disagreement   between the readers in the independent interpretation group was seen in six patients. There were   no patients with a positive [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scan and a negative [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 renogram. They   concluded that [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 renogram was as sensitive as planar or SPECT [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scan   The correspondence of visual assessment of cortical defects between [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 and   [99mTc]Tc-DMSA was evaluated by four observers in a retrospective study conducted in 2005.   Eighty-three renograms, 49 adult and 34 paediatric patients were included. The two investigations   were done within 3 months of each other. The correspondence for visual assessment of cortical   defects ranged between 85 - 89% for the four observers. All four observers agreed on the presence   of cortical defects in 18 [99mTc]Tc-DMSA studies. All those cortical defects were identified on the   [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 studies. However, two observers reported more cortical defects on the   To determine if [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 can replace [99mTc]Tc-DMSA for the assessment of the renal cortex   and split renal function a nuclear medicine consultant reviewed the scintigraphic results for 52   children (age ranged from 7 days to 10 years). Both studies were performed within 24 hours of each   other, starting with [99mTc]Tc-MAG3. They performed [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scan on the same day if good   clearance of [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 activity is seen. They performed [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scans on the   following day if residual [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 activity was seen at the end of the 30 minute renogram.   They found that [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 gave comparable findings to [99mTc]Tc-DMSA. They noted that   [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 gave the added information on urodynamics, had a lower radiation dose to   children and could lead to time saving (16). All the scars seen on [99mTc]Tc-DMSA were also   detected by [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 however, the exact number of scars was not given in the paper.   A prospective study conducted in 2013 by Abdülrezzak et al. compared [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 and   [99mTc]Tc-DMSA for the detection of renal scars. They included 135 kidneys from 68 patients (age 3   to 16 years) who were scanned using both radiopharmaceuticals within a two week time frame.   There were concordant results in 38 kidneys with cortical defects and 91 kidneys with no cortical   defects, kappa = 0.89. Discrepant results were found in six kidneys, with cortical defects called on   three [99mTc]Tc-DMSA and [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 studies but not the corresponding [99mTc]Tc-DMSA and   [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 studies. When considering [99mTc]Tc-DMSA as the reference scan, the sensitivity,   specificity, and accuracy of [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 was 92.6%, 96.8% and 95.5%, respectively.

[99mTc]Tc-MAG3 is a tubular agent commonly used to assess renal function and drainage of the   kidneys (3,9–11). The good cortical uptake of [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 has led to the proposal that cortical   defects can be assessed on the summed parenchymal images. The sensitivity and specificity of   [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 was reported to be high (88 - 93% and 88 to 100% respectively) when compared to   [99mTc]Tc-DMSA (12–15). It was found that [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 provided added information on   urodynamics, caused lower radiation dose to children and saved time (16).

Renograms of   potential kidney donors and patients worked up for radiotherapy were excluded. The renograms of   patients with solitary, transplant, auto-transplanted, ectopic, horseshoe, and fused kidneys were   The paediatric renograms used were acquired according to the relevant European Association of   Nuclear Medicine (EANM) guidelines for standard and diuretic renography at the time of acquisition   (17). The [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 dose was calculated using the applicable EANM dose card (18). The   children were imaged on the same Philips Axis Dual Head camera (previously known as Picker and   then Marconi) using a low energy high resolution collimator. Posterior images were recorded in a   128 x 128 matrix at one second per frame for the first two minutes. Thereafter the images were   recorded at 15 seconds per frame for 40 minutes. The adult renograms were recorded on a dual   head gamma camera (SIEMENS ECAM) using a low energy high resolution collimator. Posterior   images were recorded using a 128 x 128 matrix size. The frame rate was 2 seconds per frame for   the first minute, thereafter 10 seconds per frame for 40 minutes. When clinically indicated   All raw data were retrieved from the archive and anonymized then reviewed by two senior   observers and one junior observer to measure the interobserver reproducibility. Two observers   (one senior and one junior) reviewed the same images again, the interval between the two reviews   The observers reviewed the summed 1-min posterior images for the second, third and fourth   minutes of the renogram of each kidney for the presence of renal cortical defects. It was important   to evaluate 1-2 min, 2-3 min and 3-4 min summed images separately to find potential reasons that   Renal cortical defect was defined as an area of reduced or absent tracer localization and indistinct   margins that did not deform the renal contour or defined as cortical thinning, flattening, or an   The observers reported the number and location of the defects on a provided diagram (Figure 1).   The certainty of detection of cortical defects was graded as follows:   •  1 where there was definitive certainty of a cortical defect,   •  2 where there was definitive certainty there was no cortical defect or   •  3 where was no clear certainty of detection of a cortical defect. If the reader was uncertain,   the reason was reported for each kidney.   The principal investigator calculated the kidney to background ratio for each kidney as mean counts   per pixel of the kidney region of interest (ROI) divided by the mean counts per pixel of the   background ROI. The renal ROI was drawn around the whole kidney. The background ROI was C-   shaped, two pixels wide and placed one pixel apart from the kidney (10).   The impact of kidney to background ratio on the interobserver agreement was also assessed by   measuring the interobserver agreement when the kidney to background ratio was ≤2 and >2.   The interobserver and intraobserver agreements were analyzed in Stata Version 14.0 (Statacorp,   College Station TX). The inter-observer agreement was tested using percentage agreement and   Cohen’s kappa statistic for two observers and expressed as a proportion agreement with 95%   confidence interval. The inter-observer agreement between all observers was tested using   percentage agreement and Krippendorff’s reliability coefficient alpha and expressed as a   proportion agreement with 95% confidence intervals. The intraobserver agreement for each   observer comparing the earlier and later readings was tested using percentage agreement and   Krippendorff’s reliability coefficient alpha and expressed as a proportion agreement with 95%   confidence intervals. The levels of agreement were classified according to the classification defined   The cases where there was a difference in agreement between the observers were analyzed to   assess in what number of cases the difference in agreement would have a clinical impact, e.g. in   what number of cases were there a difference between the assessment of certain there was a   The effect of kidney to background ratio on the interobserver agreement was analyzed by   measuring the percentage agreement and the Krippendorff’s alpha coefficient for each kidney   when the kidney to background ratio was ≤ 2 or >2.   In total, 3000 observations were analyzed for 600 kidneys. The 1-2 minute images are routinely   used to calculate the differential renal function(DRF) therefore, the results of the 1-2 minute   images are presented in the text and the remaining results of all the analyzed images, 2-3 minute   and 3-4 minute, are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3.   The interobserver agreement for all patients between the three raters was measured by   percentage agreement and Krippendorff’s alpha coefficient. For the 1-2 minute images of the   renogram, the percentage agreement for three raters for the left kidney was 78% (95% CI: 74.8 -   82.7%) for the right kidney it was 79.7% (95% CI: 75.9 - 83.5%). The corresponding Krippendorff’s   alpha was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.45 - 0.58) and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.49 - 0.62), Table 1.

The pro-\nposed method employs a modular design procedure, decomposing\nthe original system into a proxy subsystem and a virtual tracking\nsubsystem that are controlled by the control barrier function\n(CBF)-based and Lyapunov-based controllers, respectively. By\nintegrating these separately designed controllers, the overall sys-\ntem’s safety is ensured. Moreover, a new filter-based disturbance\nobserver is utilized to design a PCBF-based safe controller for\nstrict-feedback systems subject to mismatched disturbances. This\napproach broadens the class of systems to which CBF-based\nmethods can be applied and significantly simplifies CBF construc-\ntion by requiring only the model of the proxy subsystem. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through\nnumerical simulations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\nI. INTRODUCTION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nControl Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a pow-\nerful tool for designing controllers that ensure safety in the\nform of set invariance [1], [6], [11], [13], [17], [18], [20],\n[21], [24]. When the reference trajectory is outside the safe\nregion (e.g., the dynamic obstacle is unknown to the offline\nmotion planning algorithm) or the nominal controller can lead\nto unsafe behaviors, CBFs can be employed as safety filters to\nalter control inputs in a minimally invasive manner. Compared\nwith Lyapunov-based safe control methods such as Barrier\nLyapunov Functions (BLFs) [22] and Prescribed Performance\nControl (PPC) [2], CBF-based methods offer several advan-\ntages, including less structural restrictions on constraints and\na decoupled design of the control objective (via the nominal\ncontroller) and safety specification (via the CBF). However,\ndespite many recent advances, there are certain systems that\nCBFs cannot handle but have been extensively studied by\nLyapunov-based methods in the context of stabilizing control\ndesign, such as systems with unknown control directions.\nThis limitation is partly because CBFs lack some favorable\nstructural properties of Lyapunov functions, such as positive\ndefiniteness. Therefore, expanding the system class applicable\nto CBF-based safe control design methods warrants further\ninvestigation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nConstructing valid CBFs remains a challenging problem,\nespecially for complex, high-dimensional systems or when\ndisturbances and uncertainties are present. One promising\nsolution is to construct CBFs based on a Reduced Order\nModel (ROM) of the full-order system, which can significantly\nsimplify the CBF construction and the safe control design\nprocess [6], [17], [21]. However, existing approaches either\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nY. Wang and X.

Specifically,\na proxy subsystem and a virtual\nthe\nproxy subsystem generates a safe (virtual) reference tra-\njectory and is controlled by a CBF-based controller, while\nthe virtual tracking subsystem is controlled by a Lyapunov-\nbased output-constrained controller to ensure the boundedness\nof the tracking error (see Fig. 1). The modularity of the\nproposed PCBF method offers enhanced flexibility in control\ndesign, effectively combining the strengths of both CBF-based\nand Lyapunov-based approaches. By utilizing Lyapunov-based\ntools, the PCBF method extends applicability to systems that\nexisting CBF-based methods cannot handle, particularly those\nwith unknown dynamics. Furthermore, the CBF design process\nin the PCBF method is notably simplified, as the validity of\nthe CBF does not depend on the full system dynamics, which\nallows systems with the same proxy subsystems to share a\ncommon CBF design. Compared to Lyapunov-based output-\nconstrained control techniques (e.g., BLF and PPC), the PCBF\nmethod retains the advantages of CBF approaches, enabling\na decoupled design of control objectives and safety specifi-\ncations while accommodating more flexible safety constraint\nstructures.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe contribution of this paper is twofold: (i) A PCBF con-\ntrol design scheme that integrates CBF-based and Lyapunov-\nbased methods is proposed for strict-feedback systems with\npotentially unknown models; (ii) A PCBF-based control ap-\nproach is developed for strict-feedback systems with mis-\nmatched disturbances using a new filter-based Disturbance\nObserver (DOB).

MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nA. Motivation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nConsider a control affine system ˙x = f (x) + g(x)u, where\nx ∈ Rn is the state, u ∈ Rm is the control input, and f : Rn →\nRn and g : Rn → Rn×m are known and locally Lipchitz\ncontinuous functions. Define a safe set C = {x ∈ Rn : h(x) ≥\n0}, where h : Rn → R is a sufficiently smooth function.\nThe function h is called a CBF of (input) relative degree 1 if\nsupu∈Rm [Lf h + Lghu + γh] ≥ 0 holds for all x ∈ Rn, where\nγ > 0 is a given positive constant, and Lf h = ∂h\n∂x f and Lgh =\n∂h\n∂x g are Lie derivatives [1]. When the CBF condition Lf h +\nLghu+γh ≥ 0 is incorporated into a Quadratic Program (QP),\nthe resulting CBF-QP-based controller can formally ensure the\nsafety (i.e., h(x(t)) ≥ 0 for any t ≥ 0) of the closed-loop\nsystem.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nPartly because CBFs lack favorable structural properties\nof Lyapunov functions (e.g., positive definiteness), there are\ncertain systems that CBFs cannot handle but have been ex-\ntensively studied by Lyapunov-based methods in the context\nof stabilizing control design. Consider the following Norrbin\nmodel for ship steering [9]:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n˙x1 = x2,\n˙x2 = bu + θ⊤φ(x2),\n(1b)\nwhere x1 = ψ ∈ R is the yaw angle, x2 = ˙ψ ∈ R is the\nyaw rate, u ∈ R is the rudder angle as the control input,\nθ = [− 1\nT , K > 0 is the\ngain constant, T is the time constant that can be either positive\nor negative, and α is the Norrbin coefficient determined via\na spiral test. If an uncontrolled ship (when u = 0) exhibits\nstraight-line stability (i.e., it moves along a straight path), then\nT > 0; otherwise T < 0 (see [9] and [10, Section 5.5] for more\ndetails). Thus, θ and b are considered as unknown parameters,\nand the sign of b is unknown.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nSuppose that the goal is to design a safe controller for sys-\ntem (1) with respect to a given safe set C = {x1 : h(x1) ≥ 0}\nwith h a continuously differentiable function. To the best\nof our knowledge, CBF-based control strategies are not yet\ndeveloped for systems with unknown control coefficients; if\nrobust CBF methods (e.g., [18]) are applied, the resulting QP\ncould be infeasible since the sign of b is unknown. On the\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nother hand, the Nussbaum-gain-based adaptive control meth-\nods have been developed to stabilize systems with unknown\ncontrol coefficients [16]. Then, one natural question is: can\nwe combine CBF-based safe control methods and Lyapunov-\nbased stabilizing control methods, such that we can bring the\nbest from both worlds to design a safe controller?\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nObserving the structure of system (1), one may consider\nthe system as two subsystems with x2 as the input in (1a).\nTo design a safe controller, one potential idea is to design a\nCBF-based control law for (1a) to generate a safe reference\ntrajectory for x2 that ensures h(x(t)) ≥ 0 for any t ≥ 0,\nand a Lyapunov-based output-constrained controller for (1b) to\nensure the boundedness of the tracking error. In this work, we\nwill systematize this idea and propose a modular safe control\ndesign method for strict-feedback systems with theoretical\nguarantees.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nB.

Define a safe set C as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\nC = {x ∈ Rp : h(x) ≥ 0}\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhere h : Rp → R is a sufficiently smooth function.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe problem investigated in this paper is stated as follows.\nProblem 1: Given the system shown in (2) and the safe set\nC defined in (3), design a controller u such that the closed-loop\nsystem is safe with respect to C, i.e., h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe main challenge in solving Problem 1 lies in the presence\nof unknown functions fi and gi, i ∈ [n]. To the best of our\nknowledge, no safe control design method exists for system\n(2) if fi and gi are completely unknown. For the special case\nwhere fi or gi is the sum of a known function and an unknown\ndisturbance, most existing methods tend to be conservative\nbecause the “worst-case” of the disturbance is considered.\nThe PCBF method proposed in this paper is based on a\nmodular design scheme that not only can solve safe control\ndesign problems for a more general class of systems but\nalso offer better control performance than existing methods.\nFurthermore, for many practical systems, it is reasonable to\nassume exact knowledge of f0 and g0 (e,g., for Euler-Lagrange\nsystems, f0 = 0 and g0 = 1). This assumption can be relaxed,\nwhich will be investigated in our future work.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\nIII. PCBF-BASED CONTROL DESIGN\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe PCBF method follows a modular design scheme and\nconsists of three parts: (i) decompose system (2) into a proxy\nsubsystem and a virtual tracking subsystem, (ii) design a CBF-\nbased controller for the proxy subsystem to generate a (virtual)\nsafe trajectory, and (iii) design a Lyapunov-based tracking\ncontroller for the virtual tracking subsystem to ensure the\nboundedness of the tracking error. Because the CBF-based\nand Lyapunov-based control design are decoupled, the PCBF\nmethod offers flexibility for safe control design as will be\nshown below.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nA.

Suppose that the proxy subsystem is\nselected as ˙x = f0 + g0ν + g0e without integrators where ν is\nthe virtual control and e = z1−ν. In this setup, the CBF design\nrequires the constraint ρ(0) > ∥e(0)∥ = ∥z1(0) − ν(x(0), 0)∥\nto be imposed on ν, as Lyapunov-based output-constrained\ncontrol necessitates that the initial state remains within the\noutput constraint. Since ρ(t) is used in designing ν(x, t), ν\nmust first be constructed to ensure the safety of the proxy\nsubsystem, followed by verification of whether the constraint\nρ(0) > ∥e(0)∥ is satisfied. This iterative process complicates\nthe control design and may lead to scenarios where no control\nlaw simultaneously meets both the safety requirements and the\nconstraint ρ(0) > ∥e(0)∥. Moreover, the differentiability of ν,\nwhich is required by most Lyapunov-based methods for the\ncontrol design of the virtual tracking subsystem, is difficult to\nguarantee as ν is the solution of a QP. Although this issue\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\ncan be mitigated by using smoothing techniques as part of\nthe ROM-based method, such controllers tend to be more\nconservative than QP-based controllers and are challenging\nto construct when multiple safe constraints exist [7], [19]. In\ncontrast, the proposed proxy subsystem formulation (4) can\navoid these issues.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nRemark 3: In contrast to the modular PCBF design method,\nthe ROM-based methods involve coupled ROM safe control\ndesign and tracking control design [6], [21]. In these methods,\nthe tracking controller must satisfy specific Lyapunov condi-\ntions (refer to [6, Section 6.1]), which can be challenging to\nachieve; for instance, the Lyapunov condition shown in [6, eqn.\n(71)] is not satisfiable by either the approximation-free PPC\nin Proposition 1 or the Nussbaum-based adaptive controller\nin Example 1. Furthermore, although the proxy subsystem\nincludes additional integrators, verifying the validity of h (i.e.,\nCondition (i) in Theorem 1) is simpler compared to ROM-\nbased methods (such as the equation above [6, eqn. (38)])\nbecause f0 is not involved.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nRemark 4: Although input constraints are not explicitly\naddressed in this work, they could be incorporated into the\ndesign process using techniques from input-constrained CBFs\n[4], BLFs [15], and robust control [26]. Specifically, for\nproxy subsystems with polynomial dynamics, sum-of-squares\noptimization offers a potential approach for designing CBFs\nthat account for input constraints [27].

In practice, choosing smaller ρ0 and ρ∞, along\nwith a larger λρ, reduces the conservatism of the CBF-QP\ncontroller; however, this may lead to larger control inputs\nfor the PPC/BLF-based controllers. Therefore, the choice of\nρ(t) should carefully balance the trade-off between improving\ncontrol performance and limiting the magnitude of the control\ninputs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nExample 1: Consider system (1) with parameters T =\n31, K = 0.5, α = 0.4 as in [9].

The safe set is given\nas C = {ψ : π2\n81 − ψ2 ≥ 0} that aims to keep |ψ| ≤ 20◦; the\nreference trajectory is xd = 30 sin(0.02t) in degrees. We select\nρ(t) = 0.02 and decompose the system into (4)-(5) where the\nproxy subsystem is ˙x = µ1 + e,\n˙µ1 = ν, and the virtual\ntracking subsystem is ˙e = bu + θ⊤φ − ν. With parameters\nλ1 = 6, λ2 = 1, β1 = 20, ξ = π2\n81 , one can verify that all\nconditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, so that ν is obtained by\nsolving CBF-QP (11).

We\naim to design a controller u for system (12) such that the\nclosed-loop system is safe with respect to the set C defined\nin (3), i.e., h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0. Note that fi and gi, i ∈ [n]\nin system (12) can be considered as the known part of the\nmodel with di as the unknown part - this is different from the\n“model-free” problem setting in Proposition 1 where functions\nfi and gi, i ∈ [n], in system (2) are assumed to be unknown.\nRobust CBF methods that consider the “worst-case” of dis-\nturbances have been developed for disturbed systems, but their\nperformance tends to be conservative [11], [18]. To mitigate\ntheir unnecessary conservativeness, several DOB-CBF-based\ncontrol schemes that precisely estimate and compensate for\ndisturbances are proposed [8], [23], [25]. However, for systems\nwhose disturbance relative degree is lower than the input\nrelative degree (e.g., system (12)), results on DOB-CBF-based\ncontrol are still limited. For example, the method in [23] is\noverly conservative when the system dimension is greater than\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n2, and the method in [8] is not applicable to systems whose\ninput and disturbance relative degrees differ more than one.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo design a safe controller for (12), we will propose a new\nfilter-based DOB and the corresponding DOB-PCBF-based\nsafe control strategy.

While choosing suf-\nficiently large bounds can ensure safety, it may lead to overly\nconservative control performance.

         " Yujie Wang and Xiangru Xu   Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a pow- erful tool for designing controllers that ensure safety in the form of set invariance [1], [6], [11], [13], [17], [18], [20], [21], [24]. When the reference trajectory is outside the safe region (e.g., the dynamic obstacle is unknown to the offline motion planning algorithm) or the nominal controller can lead to unsafe behaviors, CBFs can be employed as safety filters to alter control inputs in a minimally invasive manner. Compared with Lyapunov-based safe control methods such as Barrier Lyapunov Functions (BLFs) [22] and Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) [2], CBF-based methods offer several advan- tages, including less structural restrictions on constraints and a decoupled design of the control objective (via the nominal controller) and safety specification (via the CBF). However, despite many recent advances, there are certain systems that CBFs cannot handle but have been extensively studied by Lyapunov-based methods in the context of stabilizing control design, such as systems with unknown control directions. This limitation is partly because CBFs lack some favorable structural properties of Lyapunov functions, such as positive definiteness. Therefore, expanding the system class applicable to CBF-based safe control design methods warrants further investigation.   Constructing valid CBFs remains a challenging problem, especially for complex, high-dimensional systems or when disturbances and uncertainties are present. One promising solution is to construct CBFs based on a Reduced Order Model (ROM) of the full-order system, which can significantly simplify the CBF construction and the safe control design process [6], [17], [21]. However, existing approaches either   Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed PCBF control scheme.

Specifically, a proxy subsystem and a virtual the proxy subsystem generates a safe (virtual) reference tra- jectory and is controlled by a CBF-based controller, while the virtual tracking subsystem is controlled by a Lyapunov- based output-constrained controller to ensure the boundedness of the tracking error (see Fig. 1). The modularity of the proposed PCBF method offers enhanced flexibility in control design, effectively combining the strengths of both CBF-based and Lyapunov-based approaches. By utilizing Lyapunov-based tools, the PCBF method extends applicability to systems that existing CBF-based methods cannot handle, particularly those with unknown dynamics. Furthermore, the CBF design process in the PCBF method is notably simplified, as the validity of the CBF does not depend on the full system dynamics, which allows systems with the same proxy subsystems to share a common CBF design. Compared to Lyapunov-based output- constrained control techniques (e.g., BLF and PPC), the PCBF method retains the advantages of CBF approaches, enabling a decoupled design of control objectives and safety specifi- cations while accommodating more flexible safety constraint structures.   The contribution of this paper is twofold: (i) A PCBF con- trol design scheme that integrates CBF-based and Lyapunov- based methods is proposed for strict-feedback systems with potentially unknown models; (ii) A PCBF-based control ap- proach is developed for strict-feedback systems with mis- matched disturbances using a new filter-based Disturbance Observer (DOB). A preliminary version of the paper ap- peared in [24] which only considered Euler-Lagrange systems. This paper extends [24] by studying the more general strict-   feedback systems and the mismatched disturbance case.   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the motivation and problem formulation are given in Sec. II, the PCBF scheme is presented in Sec. III, the DOB-PCBF- based control strategy is presented in Sec. IV, and finally, the conclusion is drawn in Sec. V.   Notation: Given a positive integer i, [i] = {1, 2, · · · , i}. Given zi ∈ Rni for i ∈ [m], ¯zm = [z⊤ m]⊤ ∈ Rn1+···+nm. Given x ∈ Rn, ∥x∥ represents its 2-norm. Given a function f : R → R, f (i) represented its i-th derivative. For a square matrix A, λmax(A) and λmin(A) denote the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of A, respectively. Define ∂x ∈ Rn×1 R≥0 = {x ∈ R : x ≥ 0}. Consider the gradient ∂h as a row vector, where x ∈ Rn and h : Rn → R is a function with respect to x. Denote In as the identity matrix of size n.   Consider a control affine system ˙x = f (x) + g(x)u, where x ∈ Rn is the state, u ∈ Rm is the control input, and f : Rn → Rn and g : Rn → Rn×m are known and locally Lipchitz continuous functions. Define a safe set C = {x ∈ Rn : h(x) ≥ 0}, where h : Rn → R is a sufficiently smooth function. The function h is called a CBF of (input) relative degree 1 if supu∈Rm [Lf h + Lghu + γh] ≥ 0 holds for all x ∈ Rn, where γ > 0 is a given positive constant, and Lf h = ∂h ∂x f and Lgh = ∂h ∂x g are Lie derivatives [1]. When the CBF condition Lf h + Lghu+γh ≥ 0 is incorporated into a Quadratic Program (QP), the resulting CBF-QP-based controller can formally ensure the safety (i.e., h(x(t)) ≥ 0 for any t ≥ 0) of the closed-loop system.   Partly because CBFs lack favorable structural properties of Lyapunov functions (e.g., positive definiteness), there are certain systems that CBFs cannot handle but have been ex- tensively studied by Lyapunov-based methods in the context of stabilizing control design. Consider the following Norrbin model for ship steering [9]:   ˙x1 = x2, ˙x2 = bu + θ⊤φ(x2), (1b) where x1 = ψ ∈ R is the yaw angle, x2 = ˙ψ ∈ R is the yaw rate, u ∈ R is the rudder angle as the control input, θ = [− 1 T , K > 0 is the gain constant, T is the time constant that can be either positive or negative, and α is the Norrbin coefficient determined via a spiral test. If an uncontrolled ship (when u = 0) exhibits straight-line stability (i.e., it moves along a straight path), then T > 0; otherwise T < 0 (see [9] and [10, Section 5.5] for more details). Thus, θ and b are considered as unknown parameters, and the sign of b is unknown.   Suppose that the goal is to design a safe controller for sys- tem (1) with respect to a given safe set C = {x1 : h(x1) ≥ 0} with h a continuously differentiable function. To the best of our knowledge, CBF-based control strategies are not yet developed for systems with unknown control coefficients; if robust CBF methods (e.g., [18]) are applied, the resulting QP could be infeasible since the sign of b is unknown. On the   other hand, the Nussbaum-gain-based adaptive control meth- ods have been developed to stabilize systems with unknown control coefficients [16]. Then, one natural question is: can we combine CBF-based safe control methods and Lyapunov- based stabilizing control methods, such that we can bring the best from both worlds to design a safe controller?   Observing the structure of system (1), one may consider the system as two subsystems with x2 as the input in (1a). To design a safe controller, one potential idea is to design a CBF-based control law for (1a) to generate a safe reference trajectory for x2 that ensures h(x(t)) ≥ 0 for any t ≥ 0, and a Lyapunov-based output-constrained controller for (1b) to ensure the boundedness of the tracking error. In this work, we will systematize this idea and propose a modular safe control design method for strict-feedback systems with theoretical guarantees.   Consider a strict-feedback system described as follows:   ˙x = f0(x) + g0(x)z1, ˙z1 = f1(x, z1) + g1(x, z1)z2,   ˙zn−1 = fn−1(x, z1, . . . , zn−1) + gn−1(x, z1, . . . , zn−1)zn,   ˙zn = fn(x, z1, . . . , zn) + gn(x, z1, . . . , zn)u,   where x ∈ Rp, zi ∈ Rpi, i ∈ [n], are state variables, u ∈ Rq is the control input, f0 and g0 are sufficiently smooth and known functions, and fi, gi, i ∈ [n], are sufficiently smooth functions that are possibly unknown. Define a safe set C as follows:   C = {x ∈ Rp : h(x) ≥ 0}   where h : Rp → R is a sufficiently smooth function.   The problem investigated in this paper is stated as follows. Problem 1: Given the system shown in (2) and the safe set C defined in (3), design a controller u such that the closed-loop system is safe with respect to C, i.e., h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0.   The main challenge in solving Problem 1 lies in the presence of unknown functions fi and gi, i ∈ [n]. To the best of our knowledge, no safe control design method exists for system (2) if fi and gi are completely unknown. For the special case where fi or gi is the sum of a known function and an unknown disturbance, most existing methods tend to be conservative because the “worst-case” of the disturbance is considered. The PCBF method proposed in this paper is based on a modular design scheme that not only can solve safe control design problems for a more general class of systems but also offer better control performance than existing methods. Furthermore, for many practical systems, it is reasonable to assume exact knowledge of f0 and g0 (e,g., for Euler-Lagrange systems, f0 = 0 and g0 = 1). This assumption can be relaxed, which will be investigated in our future work.   The PCBF method follows a modular design scheme and consists of three parts: (i) decompose system (2) into a proxy subsystem and a virtual tracking subsystem, (ii) design a CBF- based controller for the proxy subsystem to generate a (virtual) safe trajectory, and (iii) design a Lyapunov-based tracking controller for the virtual tracking subsystem to ensure the boundedness of the tracking error. Because the CBF-based and Lyapunov-based control design are decoupled, the PCBF method offers flexibility for safe control design as will be shown below.   We decompose the strict-feedback system shown in (2) into   the proxy subsystem:   ˙x = f0(x) + g0(x)µ1 + g0(x)e, ˙µ1 = µ2, ... ˙µm−1 = µm, ˙µm = ν,   and the virtual tracking subsystem:   ˙e = f1(x, e + µ1) + g1(x, e + µ1)z2 − µ2, z2 = f2(x, e + µ1, z2) + g2(x, e + µ1, z2)z3,   ˙zn−1 = fn−1(x, e + µ1, z2, . . . , zn−1)   + gn−1(x, e + µ1, z2, . . . , zn−1)zn,   ˙zn = fn(x, e + µ1, z2, . . . , zn)   + gn(x, e + µ1, z2, . . . , zn)u,   where e = z1 − µ1 is the virtual tracking error, ν ∈ Rp1 is the virtual control input to be designed, and µ1, µ2, · · · , µm ∈ Rp1 are virtual states with the number m ≤ n a positive integer to be determined. The initial conditions of the virtual states are selected as µ1(0) = z1(0) and µi(0) = 0 for i = 2, · · · , m.   the virtual   The proxy subsystem (4) consists of dynamics of x and a chain of integrators, which mainly serve to provide the explicit forms of the derivatives of µ1 as will be explained later; tracking subsystem (5) consists of error dynamics of e, which is derived from (2b) and (4b), and equations of z3, z4, . . . , zn. The state variables x, z1, · · · , zn evolve identically in the original system (2) and subsystems (4)-(5) when given the same control input u.   Given the system decomposition shown in (4)-(5), the safe control design problem for system (2) will be solved by accomplishing the following two tasks:   • Design a CBF-based control law ν for the subsystem (4) to ensure h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0, under the assumption   where ρ : R≥0 → R>0 is a predefined smooth bounded function whose derivatives up to n-th order are bounded. • Design a Lyapunov-based control law u for the subsystem   (5) to ensure (6) holds.   As will be explained in the next three subsections, these two tasks can be accomplished separately, and the controllers constructed for the two subsystems together provide a solution to Problem 1.   The main difficulty of designing a CBF-based controller for the proxy subsystem (4) lies in the existence of e, which is considered as a mismatched disturbance to be rejected and has a relative degree lower than that of the virtual input ν, implying it is difficult to completely decouple e [28]. To address this issue, we define a set of functions as follows:   bi(¯µi, ¯yi, y0, x, t) = Mi(f0 + g0µ1) −   ξ, βi, λi for i ∈ [m] are positive constants, y0 = χ(h/ξ), yi = χ(i)(h/ξ) for i ∈ [m], and b0 = y0. Here, χ : R → R is a (m + 1)-th order differentiable function satisfying χ(0) = 0, χ(τ ) = 1 for τ ≥ 1, and dχ   dτ > 0 for τ < 1 [20].   With these notations, the following theorem presents a CBF- based control design method for proxy subsystem (4) to ensure h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0, under condition (6). The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.   Theorem 1: Consider the proxy subsystem (4) and the safe set C defined in (3). Suppose that condition (6) holds, and there exist ξ > 0, λi > 0, i ∈[m+1], and βi > 0, i ∈ [m], such that (i) for any x ∈ C, Lg0h = 0 ⇒ h ≥ ξ holds; (ii) for any t ≥ 0, m+1 j=2 ρ(t)2 ≤ Πm+1 j=1 λj holds; (iii) y0(0) > 0 and bi(¯µi(0), ¯yi(0), y0(0), x(0), 0) > 0 for i ∈ [m] where bi is defined in (7). Then, for any x ∈ C and µ1, · · · , µm ∈ Rp1, the set   KBF = {v ∈ Rp1 : ψ0 + ψ1v ≥ 0}   is non-empty, where   µj+1 + Mm+1(f0 + g0µ1)   +λm+1bm − ∥Mm+1g0∥ρ, ∂bm ∂µm   with Mm+1 defined in (8). Moreover, any Lipschitz continu- ous controller ν ∈ KBF ensures h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0.   Remark 1: The function bi in (7) is specifically designed to ensure both the non-emptiness of KBF and ˙bi−1 +λibi−1 ≥ bi   for i ∈ [m]. This guarantees the implication bi ≥ 0 ⇒ bi−1 ≥ 0 for i ∈ [m]; consequently, ν ∈ KBF ⇒ bm ≥ 0 ⇒ b0 ≥ 0 ⇔ h ≥ 0. The construction of bi is achieved by computing ˙bi−1 by using the chain rule and accounting for the worst- case scenario of the virtual tracking error e. Detailed steps can be found in the proof. In practice, the explicit expression of bi can be derived using symbolic computation tools. For the special case where Lg0h ̸= 0 for any x ∈ C, the conclusion of Theorem 1 remain valid by dropping Condition (i) and (ii) and without using the function χ (i.e., replace functions y0 and yi in (7) with h and 0, respectively). The details are omitted due to the page limitation.   The safe control law ν in Theorem 1 is obtained by solving   the following convex CBF-QP:   (i = 2, · · · , n), and ρi (i = 2, · · · , n) smooth positive functions satisfying limt→∞ ρi(t) > 0 and ρi(0) > |zi(0) − ηi−1(¯zi−1(0), µ1(0), 0)|.   The control law in Proposition 1 is robust since it does not rely on the information of fi and gi, i ∈ [n]. Furthermore, because the reference signal in PPC is only required to be continuously differentiable [3, Assumption 4], one may select m = 1 for the proxy subsystem, which will result in a simple control design in Subsection III-B. However, in this case, the PPC controller tends to yield large and oscillating control input; see the simulation results in Example 2. In addition, although we assume pi = 1 and q = 1, the approximation- free PPC can be readily extended to multi-input multi-output systems (i.e., pi, q > 1), as discussed in [3, Remark 2].   min ν s.t. ψ0 + ψ1ν ≥ 0   where ψ0, ψ1 are given in (10), νd is any nominal control law that is possibly unsafe. Note that this QP is always feasible by the non-emptiness of the set KBF . Since ν serves as the control input to the proxy subsystem rather than the original system (2), the nominal controller νd is typically not provided directly. The following result offers a method for designing νd. The proof of this Corollary is given in Appendix B.   Corollary 1: Consider the proxy subsystem (4) and the safe set C defined in (3). Suppose that the right inverse of g0 exists for any x ∈ C, condition (6) holds, and xd(t) is a reference trajectory that is (m + 1)-th order differentiable. Then the control law ν given as ν = αm+1, which cor- responds to the nominal controller νd in (11), will ensure the tracking error x − xd is globally Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB), where αm+1 is defined recursively according 0(k0ϵ0 + f0 − ˙xd) − g⊤ 0 ϵ0 to α1 = −g† , α2 = ∂α1 ∂x (f0 + 2c0    0 ϵ0 −k1ϵ1, αi = ∂αi−1 g0µ1)− ϵ1  ∂α1 −g⊤ ∂x (f0 + ∂x g0  2c1 g0µ1)+i−2 µj+1−ϵi−2− ϵi−1 ∂αi−1 ∂αi−1 ∂x g0 −ki−1ϵi−1 2ci−1 ∂µj for i = 3, · · · , m + 1, with ϵ0 = x − xd, ϵi = µi − αi for i ∈ [m], and positive constants ki, ci > 0 for i = 0, 1, · · · , m.   Control design for the virtual tracking subsystem (5) can be accomplished by any Lyapunov-based method that ensures (6) holds, such as BLF [12], [16], [22] and PPC [2], [3]. This flexibility demonstrates modularity of our proposed approach. In particular, by leveraging the approximation-free PPC technique shown in [3, Theorem 2], a “model-free” control law without the information of fi and gi can be designed, as presented in the following result whose proof is similar to [3, Theorem 2] and omitted due to page limit.   Proposition 1: Consider the virtual tracking subsystem (5) with q = 1 and pi = 1, i ∈ [n]. Suppose that (i) the sign of gi is known and |gi| ≥ bi, i ∈ [n], where bi > 0 is an unknown constant, and (ii) when m > 1, µ1 and µ2 (or µ1 and ν when m = 1) are bounded with possibly unknown bounds. Then, the control law designed as u = ηn will ensure |e(t)| ≤ ρ(t) where   1+ξi ηn is defined recursively according to ηi = −ki log , 1−ξi i ∈ [n], with ki a positive constant, ξ1 = z1−µ1 , ξi =   D. Safety Guarantee of the Overall System   The safety of system (2) can be ensured by combining the controllers separately designed for the proxy subsystem and the virtual tracking subsystem in the preceding subsections, as shown in the following result.   Corollary 2: Consider system (2), the safe set defined in (3), and the decomposition shown in (4)-(5). Suppose that all conditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, such that a Lipschitz continuous controller ν ∈ KBF is given by the CBF-QP (11). Then, any Lipschitz continuous control law u that ensures ∥e(t)∥ ≤ ρ(t) for the virtual tracking subsystem (5) will guarantee h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0, for system (2).   The modular safe control design method offers several advantages: i) By leveraging both CBF-based and Lyapunov- based tools, the proposed method can design safe controllers for a general class of systems shown in (2) that cannot be tack- led by either tool separately; ii) Because the proxy subsystem (4) is more structured than the original system (2), validity of the CBF h can be verified by a simple condition (i.e., Condition (i) of Theorem 1), which significantly simplifies the CBF construction and guarantees feasibility of the CBF- QP shown in (11) as KBF is non-empty; iii) Different systems (e.g., Euler-Lagrange systems) with the same proxy subsystem share an identical CBF design, which simplifies the whole safe control design process.   Remark 2: Including a chain of integrators in the proxy subsystem is crucial. Suppose that the proxy subsystem is selected as ˙x = f0 + g0ν + g0e without integrators where ν is the virtual control and e = z1−ν. In this setup, the CBF design requires the constraint ρ(0) > ∥e(0)∥ = ∥z1(0) − ν(x(0), 0)∥ to be imposed on ν, as Lyapunov-based output-constrained control necessitates that the initial state remains within the output constraint. Since ρ(t) is used in designing ν(x, t), ν must first be constructed to ensure the safety of the proxy subsystem, followed by verification of whether the constraint ρ(0) > ∥e(0)∥ is satisfied. This iterative process complicates the control design and may lead to scenarios where no control law simultaneously meets both the safety requirements and the constraint ρ(0) > ∥e(0)∥. Moreover, the differentiability of ν, which is required by most Lyapunov-based methods for the control design of the virtual tracking subsystem, is difficult to guarantee as ν is the solution of a QP. Although this issue   can be mitigated by using smoothing techniques as part of the ROM-based method, such controllers tend to be more conservative than QP-based controllers and are challenging to construct when multiple safe constraints exist [7], [19]. In contrast, the proposed proxy subsystem formulation (4) can avoid these issues.   Remark 3: In contrast to the modular PCBF design method, the ROM-based methods involve coupled ROM safe control design and tracking control design [6], [21]. In these methods, the tracking controller must satisfy specific Lyapunov condi- tions (refer to [6, Section 6.1]), which can be challenging to achieve; for instance, the Lyapunov condition shown in [6, eqn. (71)] is not satisfiable by either the approximation-free PPC in Proposition 1 or the Nussbaum-based adaptive controller in Example 1. Furthermore, although the proxy subsystem includes additional integrators, verifying the validity of h (i.e., Condition (i) in Theorem 1) is simpler compared to ROM- based methods (such as the equation above [6, eqn. (38)]) because f0 is not involved.   Remark 4: Although input constraints are not explicitly addressed in this work, they could be incorporated into the design process using techniques from input-constrained CBFs [4], BLFs [15], and robust control [26]. Specifically, for proxy subsystems with polynomial dynamics, sum-of-squares optimization offers a potential approach for designing CBFs that account for input constraints [27]. We plan to explore this problem in future work.   Remark 5: Similar to PPC [2], the function ρ(t) can be defined as an exponentially decaying function ρ(t) = (ρ0 − ρ∞)e−λρt + ρ∞ where ρ0, ρ∞, λρ are positive constants with ρ0 > ρ∞. In practice, choosing smaller ρ0 and ρ∞, along with a larger λρ, reduces the conservatism of the CBF-QP controller; however, this may lead to larger control inputs for the PPC/BLF-based controllers. Therefore, the choice of ρ(t) should carefully balance the trade-off between improving control performance and limiting the magnitude of the control inputs.   Example 1: Consider system (1) with parameters T = 31, K = 0.5, α = 0.4 as in [9]. Recall that θ and b are both unknown parameters, which makes the problem unsolvable by existing CBF methods. The safe set is given as C = {ψ : π2 81 − ψ2 ≥ 0} that aims to keep |ψ| ≤ 20◦; the reference trajectory is xd = 30 sin(0.02t) in degrees. We select ρ(t) = 0.02 and decompose the system into (4)-(5) where the proxy subsystem is ˙x = µ1 + e, ˙µ1 = ν, and the virtual tracking subsystem is ˙e = bu + θ⊤φ − ν. With parameters λ1 = 6, λ2 = 1, β1 = 20, ξ = π2 81 , one can verify that all conditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, so that ν is obtained by solving CBF-QP (11). We design a Nussbaum-based adaptive controller u = N (ζ)α [16], where α = ke−ν+ˆθ⊤φ, N (·) is a Nussbaum-type function, ζ and ˆθ are governed by adaptive laws ˙ζ = eα ˆθ, respectively,  and γ1 = 10, γ2 = 2, k = 2. By Corollary 2, the safety of the closed-loop system is satisfied. From the simulation result shown in Fig. 2, one can see that the trajectory of ψ indeed stays within the safe region, while the desired tracking performance is well preserved inside C.   Figure 2: Simulation results of Example 1. The safety is always respected as the trajectory of ψ stays inside the safe region whose boundary is represented by the dashed red line.   In this section, we introduce a novel filter-based DOB and integrate it into the PCBF framework, enabling a DOB-PCBF- based safe control design scheme that addresses limitations of existing DOB-CBF methods in handling strict-feedback systems with mismatched disturbances. The system under consideration is described as   ˙x = f0(x) + g0(x)z1, ˙z1 = f1(x, z1) + g1(x, z1)z2 + d1, z2 = f2(x, z1, z2) + g2(x, z1, z2)z3 + d2,   ˙zn = fn(x, z1, . . . , zn) + gn(x, z1, . . . , zn)u + dn,   where x ∈ Rp, z1 ∈ Rp1, . . . , zn ∈ Rpn are state variables, f0, f1, . . . , fn and g0, g1, . . . , gn are all known sufficiently smooth functions, d1, . . . , dn represent lumped unknown dis- turbances/uncertainties, and u ∈ Rq is the control input. We aim to design a controller u for system (12) such that the closed-loop system is safe with respect to the set C defined in (3), i.e., h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0. Note that fi and gi, i ∈ [n] in system (12) can be considered as the known part of the model with di as the unknown part - this is different from the “model-free” problem setting in Proposition 1 where functions fi and gi, i ∈ [n], in system (2) are assumed to be unknown. Robust CBF methods that consider the “worst-case” of dis- turbances have been developed for disturbed systems, but their performance tends to be conservative [11], [18]. To mitigate their unnecessary conservativeness, several DOB-CBF-based control schemes that precisely estimate and compensate for disturbances are proposed [8], [23], [25]. However, for systems whose disturbance relative degree is lower than the input relative degree (e.g., system (12)), results on DOB-CBF-based control are still limited. For example, the method in [23] is overly conservative when the system dimension is greater than   2, and the method in [8] is not applicable to systems whose input and disturbance relative degrees differ more than one.   To design a safe controller for (12), we will propose a new filter-based DOB and the corresponding DOB-PCBF-based safe control strategy. The following assumption is standard.   Assumption 1: The derivatives of disturbances di, i ∈ [n], are bounded, i.e., ∥ ˙di∥ ≤ ωi, where ωi is an unknown constant.   The DOB we use has the following form [5]:   ˆdi = si + αizi,    −αi(fi + gizi+1 + ˆdi), −αn(fn + gnu + ˆdn),   if i ∈ [n − 1], if i = n,   where ˆdi is the estimation of di, αi is a positive constant, and si is the internal state of the DOB, for i ∈ [n]. With a d,ied,i, where ed,i = ˆdi − di, one Lyapunov function V d i where κi = αi − νi i + ωd can verify that 2 , νi < 2αi is a positive constant, and ωd . Thus, ed,i is globally UUB.   i = 1 ˙V d i ≤ −2κiV d   Following the system decomposition scheme developed in Section III, system (12) can be decomposed into the proxy subsystem shown in (4) with m = n and the following virtual tracking subsystem:   ˙e = f1 + g1z2 + d1 − µ2, ˙z2 = f2 + g2z3 + d2,   ˙zn = fn + gnu + dn,   where e = z1 − µ1 and µi, i ∈ [m], are defined in (4). The CBF-based control design for the proxy subsystem follows Theorem 1 under condition (6). We will propose a new DOB- based control approach for the subsystem (14) to ensure (6) holds.   The high-order derivatives of ˆdi, i ∈ [n − 1], are indispens- able for control design because di is a mismatched disturbance. ˙ˆdi = −αied,i and ed,i relies However, on di. To address this issue, we propose a filter-based DOB, which can generate alternative disturbance estimation signals that are close to di and have known derivatives, as follows:   ˙ˆdi is unknown because   ˙ˆdf i,j = −Ti,j( ˆdf   where j ∈ [n − i], i ∈ [n − 1], ˆdf i,j is the filtered disturbance estimation, and Ti,j > 0 is a positive constant. The following lemma shows the convergence of the filter.   Lemma 1: Consider the DOB given in (13) and the filter presented in (15). Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. Then the filtered disturbance estimation error δi = ˆdf i,n−i − di, i ∈ [n − 1], is globally UUB.   The proof of the lemma is given in Appendix C. From Lemma 1 one can see that ˆdf i,n−i, whose derivatives up to the (n − i)-th order are explicitly given, is close to di in the sense that ∥δi∥ is bounded by a known decaying function, implying that one can replace ˆdi with ˆdf i,j in DOB design. Note that the ultimate bound of δi can be made arbitrarily small by selecting appropriate parameters.   The following theorem provides a filtered-DOB-based con- troller for the virtual tracking subsystem (14) to ensure ∥e∥ ≤ ρ. The control design follows backstepping [14], and the filtered disturbance estimation error δi is compensated by virtual control signals.   Theorem 2: Consider system (12), the safe set defined in (3), and the decomposition given by (4) and (14) with m = n. Suppose that all conditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, such that a Lipschitz continuous controller ν is given by the CBF- QP (11). Suppose that Assumption 1 holds, the right inverse of gi exists for any x ∈ C and z1 ∈ Rp1, · · · , zi ∈ Rpi (i ∈ [n]), the DOB is given in (13), and the filter is given in (15). If   (n−j +1)ϵn 4γf j   ϵn 4(κn − σn)   where  ˙ρ τ1 = g†  ρ   e−k1e− ˆdf   j=1 (n−i+1)ϵi 4(γf i −σi)   are virtual control signals designed by following backstepping, κn is defined after (13), ki > 0 (i ∈ [n]), γf i > 0 (i ∈ [n−1]), 0 < σi < γf (i ∈ [n − 1]), 0 < σn < κn, ϵ1 = e, i ρ2−∥e∥2 , li = ϵi−1 ϵi = zi − τi−1 (i = 2, · · · , n), l2 = ∂t + i−1 (i = 3, · · · , n), Ni = ∂τi−1 (fj + gjzj+1) + i−1 i j,n−m − m=j ∂ ˆdf ∂x (f0+g0z1) for i = 2, · · · , n, and µn+1 = ν,   ∂τi−1 ∂µj ˆdf j,n−m−1)+ ∂τi−1 then (6) holds.   The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix D. Safety of the closed-loop system (12) with the controller u follows from Corollary 2 because of modularity of the proposed method.   Remark 6: The DOB-CBF-QP controllers developed in [8], [23] do not compensate for all uncertain terms, and their performance heavily depends on the availability of accurate bounds for the disturbances or their derivatives, which are often difficult to determine in practice. While choosing suf- ficiently large bounds can ensure safety, it may lead to overly conservative control performance. In contrast, the method pre- sented in Theorem 2 compensates for all unknown terms using the filters and does not rely on the bounds of the disturbances or their derivatives - this highlights the effectiveness of the modular PCBF control framework.   Example 2: Consider the following electromechanical sys-   tem with mismatched disturbances adopted from [29]:   ˙x = z1, ˙z1 = f1(x, z1) + g1z2 + d1, ˙z2 = f2(x, z1, z2) + g2u + d2,   where f1 = −(Bz1 + N0 sin(x))/M0, g1 = 1/M0, f2 = −(Kbz1 + Rmz2)/Lm, g2 = 1/Lm, d1, d2 are external distur- bances, and M0, B, N0, Lm, Rm, Kb are physical parameters whose values are the same as those in [29]. The safe set is C = {x ∈ Rn : −0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.3}, so we select two CBFs h1 = x + 0.5 and h2 = −x + 0.3. For comparison, three methods in simulation: (i) the DOB- we implement PCBF method by utilizing Corollary 1, Corollary 2, and Theorem 2; (ii) the model-free PCBF-based control law by using Corollary 1, Corollary 2, and Proposition 1; and (iii) the DOB-CBF-QP proposed in [23]. The disturbances are selected as d1 = d2 = sin(t) + 0.2 sin(2t) − 0.5 cos(5t) + cos(3t), from which one can verify that Assumption 1 holds with ω1 = ω2 = 6; the reference trajectory is xd = sin(t); and the control parameters for the DOB-PCBF method are β1 = β2 = 0.05, ρ(t) = 0.8e−10t + 0.05, λ1 = λ2 = 10, λ3 = 15, α1 = α2 = 30, γ1 = 50, θ1 = 10, T1,1 = 100, k1 = k2 = 10, σ1 = σ2 = 15, ν1 = ν2 = 1. The Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB is used to compute ψ0, ψ1 in (10), as well as u in (16) and (17). The simulation results are presented in Fig. 3, which demonstrates that all three methods can ensure safety but their tracking performance and control input profiles are different: the DOB-PCBF method has perfect tracking performance with the smoothest control input profile; the model-free PCBF approach generates almost identical tracking performance as the DOB-PCBF method but its control input profile is more oscillatory; the DOB-CBF- QP approach has a poor tracking performance compared with other two methods.   Figure 3: Simulation results of Example 2. All three methods can ensure safety but the DOB-PCBF method has the best tracking performance and the smoothest control profile.   A PCBF safe control design scheme that   integrates Lyapunov-based and CBF-based control approaches is pro- posed for strict-feedback systems with potentially unknown   dynamics. Moreover, a DOB-PCBF-based controller is pre- sented for systems with mismatched disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Future work includes conducting experimental studies and taking input constraints into account.   A. Proof of Theorem 1   The proof consists of four steps. We will first show bi in (7) can be expressed as the sum of three functions, and then the non-emptiness of KBF . After that we will show bm ≥ 0, and bi ≥ 0 =⇒ bi−1 ≥ 0 holds for i ∈ [m]. Finally, we can see b0 ≥ 0 ⇔ h ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0 from the definition of b0 and the function χ under (8).   (i) Expression of bi. We claim that bi in (7) can be expressed   as the sum of three functions. Claim. The function bi defined in (7) can be expressed in the following form for any i ∈ [m]:   bi = si(x, ¯µi, ¯yi) + li(y0) + Ti(t)   i (x, ¯µi)¯yαk   where si = ni is a polynomial function of ¯yi for fixed x, ¯µi, li = i j=1 λjy0 is a linear function of y0,  ◦ βj−1 and Ti = − βi  ρ(t)2 is a time-varying function. In the expression of si, ni is a non-negative integer, φk is a function whose form can i be uniquely determined, ¯yαk . . . yαk i where ¯yi = ii]⊤ is a vector i2 . . . αk [y1 y2 · · · yi]⊤ and αk of non-negative integers satisfying ∥αk i ∥1 ≥ 1, which implies that φk   can not be a constant for fixed x and ¯µi.   i (x, ¯µi)¯yαk   We will prove the claim using mathematical induction. For   i = 1, from (7) we can rewrite b1 as follows:   (Lf0h+Lg0hµ1)y1 −   which implies that (19) holds when i = 1.   Now assume that   We only have to prove that 1. From (8), we have Md+1 =   i = d ≥ 1. (19) holds for i = d + d y1 +   d . It is clear ξ that every term in any entry of Md+1 (note that Md+1 is a vector) can be expressed in the form of φk and it can not be a constant also easy to verify that each term in d ∂bd j=1 ∂µj αk be expressed in the form of φk d+1(x, ¯µd+1)¯y because d+1  ¯yαk µj+1 = nd ∂bd d . Hence, Md+1(f0 + ∂µj g0µ1) − ∥Md+1g0∥2 µj+1, which is included as part of bd+1, can be expressed in the form of sd+1.   for fixed x, ¯µd+1.   In addition, since ∂bd   2 ρ2, which are the rest d +d+1 terms in bd+1, are equal to nd j=1 λjy0 − ◦ρ2, one can 2 ρ2 −d+1 βd+1 express the first summation term in the form of sd+1, consider the second term d+1 j=1 λjy0 as ld+1 and the sum of the rest two terms as Td+1. Hence, bd+1 can be expressed as (19), which completes the proof of the claim.   (ii) Non-emptiness of KBF . We will show the non-emptiness of KBF by proving that ψ1 = 0 =⇒ ψ0 ≥ 0 holds for any x ∈ C and µ1, · · · , µm ∈ Rp1. First we claim that ∂bi = ∂µi y1 ξ Lg0 h for i ∈ [m]. For i = 1, this claim is clear from b1 given in (20). Assume that the claim is true for i = d where d ≥ 1, then, because the only term in bd+1 including µd+1 is µd+1, implying that ∂bd+1 ∂bd ξ Lg0 h and thus the ∂µd+1 ∂µd claim is true for i = d + 1. Hence, the claim is proved.   Next, invoking (10b), one can see ψ1 = y1   ξ Lg0h. Now we assume ψ1 = 0, which implies y1 = 0 or Lg0 h = 0. If y1 = 0, one can see that h ≥ ξ from the definition of χ. Meanwhile, from Condition (i) one can see that Lg0h = 0 indicates h ≥ ξ for any x ∈ C. Note that h ≥ ξ implies y0 = 1 and y1 = y2 = · · · = ym+1 = 0, according to their definitions shown below (7). Hence, from (19) one can ◦· · ·◦ conclude bm = m  d  ◦ ρ2 because sm is a polynomial of ¯ym for fixed x dt + λm and ¯µm (with no constant terms), meaning that it equals 0 as yi = 0, i ∈ [m]. Moreover, invoking (19), one can readily ∂x = 0 and m yj+1 ∂bm verify that ∂bm ξ = 0, j=0 ∂yj implying that Mm+1 = 0. Similarly, it can be shown m−1 µj+1 = 0. Thus, according to (10a) and (19), j=1 one can see ψ0 = ∂bm ∂t + λm+1bm =  ◦ ρ2. m+1 j=1 λj − m+1 βj−1 dt + λm+1  From Condition (ii), ψ0 ≥ 0, meaning that KBF ̸= ∅.   ∂t + λm+1bm = ∂Tm  ◦ · · · ◦  d   (iii) ν ∈ KBF =⇒ bm ≥ 0. One can see ˙bm + λm+1bm = ∂x ˙x+m−1 ∂bm ∂t + ∂bm ∂h ∂x ˙x+ ∂µm λm+1bm ≥ Mm+1(f0 + g0µ1) + m−1 ∂t + ∂bm ν +λm+1bm −∥Mm+1g0∥ρ = ψ0 +ψ1ν. Hence, selecting ∂µm ν ∈ KBF implies ˙bm + λm+1bm ≥ 0, and thus bm ≥ 0 as Condition (iii) holds.   ∂x g0e ≤ −k0∥ϵ0∥2 − k1∥ϵ1∥2 + ϵ⊤   Indeed, (22) holds for i = 1 as ˙V1 = ˙V0+ϵ⊤ 0 ϵ0−k1ϵ1−  ϵ1 1 ϵ2 + ∂x g0 2c1 c0+c1 ¯ρ2. Now assume that (22) holds for i = k − 1 where    k ≥ 2. Since ˙Vk = ˙Vk−1 + ϵ⊤ −  k kkϵk − ∂αk j=0 cj, (22) holds for i = k. Hence, by mathematical induction, (22) holds for all i ∈ [m − 1].   Note that   cj +ϵm(νd − ˙αm)   where χ = 2 min{k0, k1, · · · , km}. Using the standard Lya- punov argument, one can see that ϵ0 is globally UUB.   C. Proof of Lemma 1 i = [ef ⊤   d,i]⊤ where ed,i is defined after (13) and ef i,j−1 for j ∈ [n − i] and i ∈ [n − 1]. We will demonstrate that δi is globally UUB by establishing the boundedness of Ef i .   · · · ef ⊤ i,j − ˆdf   From (15) we have   where Bi = [0 · · · 0 − Ipi]⊤ and   (iv) bi ≥ 0 ⇒ bi−1 ≥ 0 for any i ∈ [m]. Note that   j=1 +Mi(f0 + g0µ1) = bi − λibi−1.   Thus, bi ≥ 0 indicates ˙bi−1 + λibi−1 ≥ 0, which implies bi−1 ≥ 0 as bi−1(¯µi−1(0), ¯yi−1(0), y0(0), x(0), 0) > 0. Hence, b0 ≥ 0, which indicates that h(x(t)) ≥ 0, ∀t ≥ 0.   B. Proof of Corollary 1   This proof follows the backstepping technique [14]. We j ϵj where i ∈ [m]   define V0 = 1 and consider the worst-case of e in virtual control design.   ˙V0 = ϵ⊤ 0 g0e − ∥g⊤ ≤ −k0∥ϵ0∥2 +ϵ⊤   0 (f0 + g0(α1 + ϵ1 + e) − ˙xd) = −k0∥ϵ0∥2 + 0 g0ϵ1 + ∥ϵ⊤ 0 g0∥ρ − 0 g0ϵ1 + c0 2 ¯ρ2, where ¯ρ = supt≥0 ρ(t). We claim the following inequality holds for any i ∈ [m − 1]:   It is easy to check that all eigenvalues of Ai are negative, so for any γi > 0, there exists a positive definite matrix Pi satisfying A⊤ i Pi + PiAi = −γiIpi(n−i+1). Define a candidate Lyapunov function as   whose derivative satisfies   (A⊤ i ≤ −γi∥Ef i ∥Ef ≤ −γf   i Pi +PiAi)Ef √ i ∥2 + 2 i ∥2 + ωf   i + ˙d⊤ i PiEf i B⊤ piωi∥Pi∥∥Ef i ∥   where 0 < θi < γi, γf From (26) one can conclude that Ef i indicates that δi is also globally UUB since   i = γi − θi > 0, and ωf   i = piω2 . is globally UUB, which   Note that for i ∈ [n − 1], τi is a function of x,¯zi,¯µi+1,t, ˆdf j,n−j,. . . , ˆdf 2, · · · , n) as   j,n−i (j ∈ [i]). Define candidate BLFs Vi(i =   Vi(e, ¯ϵi, ¯Ef   i ) = Vi−1(e, ¯ϵi−1, ¯Ef   2 log n = V d   + V f where V1(e, Ef (i ∈ [n − 1]) are defined in (25), V f n is defined after (13). The control design follows the BLF backstepping technique [22], and the disturbances are compensated by their estimates presented in (13) and (15).   Clearly ˙V1 in the open set Z(t) = {e ∈ R : ∥e∥ < ρ} ρ e − 1 ∥2 −   4(γf n∥e∥∥Ef e⊤g1ϵ2 1 ∥ ρ2−∥e∥2 − σ1∥Ef ρ2−∥e∥2 + 1 ∥2 ≤ − k1e2 (γf we will show for any i = 2, · · · , n − 1,   ˙V2 = ˙V1 + ϵ⊤ One can verify that f2 + g2τ2 + g2ϵ3 + d2 − ∂τ1 ˙V f 2 = ˙V1 + ϵ⊤ ˙ˆdf  + ˙V f 2 µj+1 − ∂τ1 ∂τ1 1,n−1 − ∂τ1 j=1 ∂t ∂µj − k1∥e∥2 1 ∥2 − σ2∥Ef ρ2−∥e∥2 − k2∥ϵ2∥2 − σ1∥Ef √ ωf n − 1∥Ef 2 − (γf 2 ∥2 + ∥ϵ2∥ γf n∥Ef 1 ∥Ef − k1∥e∥2 ρ2−∥e∥2 − k2∥ϵ2∥2 − σ1∥Ef 2 + ϵ⊤ 2 g2ϵ3, so (29) holds for i = 2.

While data exist that support this hypothesis and cognitive models of psychotic\nsymptoms broadly,3,20–27 these studies are somewhat limited by general-population sampling and\ncross-sectional designs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIndirect evidence from the putatively prodromal Clinical High-Risk state for psychosis (CHR-P)\nindicates that hallucinations and delusions may not emerge at the same time: they co-occur much\nmore frequently after the onset of threshold-level psychosis.1,2,5 Additionally, delusional ideation is\npresent in nearly all participants with perceptual abnormalities, but perceptual abnormalities are\npresent in only some individuals with delusional ideation.5,28 However, no known studies have\ndirectly examined the relative timing of symptom onset during and directly following symptom\nemergence. Ideally, longitudinal data would be obtained from large, naturalistically followed\nsamples of individuals when positive symptoms are actively and acutely emerging. Doing so would\nallow for a more detailed and accurate understanding of symptom emergence and evolution within\nthe natural history of psychosis.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe examined the onset and evolution of delusions and hallucinations over time in two large\nprospective CHR-P cohorts (N = 719 and 699) and one large retrospective (follow-back) first\nepisode psychosis (FEP) cohort (N = 694). We investigated these questions across stages of\nillness in order to identify consistencies that may be present before and after psychosis onset.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAll participants provided written informed consent after receiving a complete description of the\nconstituent studies, which were approved by local ethics committees.

The final CHR-P samples included 719\nparticipants from NAPLS 2 and 699 from NAPLS 3.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe PEPP sample consisted of 694 consecutive patients in their first episode of psychosis who\nwere deemed eligible and consented to participate. For eligibility, participants were required not to\nhave taken antipsychotic medication for greater than 30 days prior to referral. Patients with IQ <\n70, psychotic illness solely related to substance use, or non-psychiatric causes of mental disorder\nwere not enrolled in PEPP.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS)34 was administered to evaluate for\na psychosis-risk syndrome by certified personnel at each site. For the purposes of brevity in this\npaper, we will discuss hallucination- and delusion-spectrum symptoms (e.g. attenuated psychotic\nsymptoms) as hallucinations and delusions, respectively. As has been done previously,20 CHR-P-\nlevel P1 (unusual thoughts) and P2 (suspiciousness) ratings (3-5) were taken as signifying the\npresence of early delusional ideation. P1 and P2 intensity has been shown to predict delusion\nformation20 and progression of illness to psychosis.28,35,36 CHR-P-level P4 (perceptual\nabnormalities) ratings (3-5) were taken as ratings of early hallucinatory phenomena. The maximum\nscore for either P1 or P2 was used for subsequent analyses. Based on these ratings, participants\nwere characterized as having only delusions, only hallucinations, both, or neither at each\ntimepoint. Because the SIPS also elicits information on the timing of symptoms onset prior to\nbaseline assessment, we were able to obtain information on the relative timing of onset of\nhallucinations and delusions even in those who presented with both symptoms at baseline. If the\ndifference between the onset times of delusions and hallucinations was less than one month, we\nconsidered the participant to be in the combined-onset group. To further delineate participant\ntrajectories, we identified those participants who ultimately entered remission from those who did\nnot; participants with scores lower than 3 in P1, P2, and P4 during their last available visit were\nclassified as remitters.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nPatients in the PEPP sample were assessed at baseline using the Circumstances of Onset and\nRelapse Schedule (CORS)37, which allowed for retrospective determination of pre-onset\n(prodromal) and initial psychotic symptoms (the first prodromal symptom contiguous with\npsychosis onset), the first psychotic symptom, and the first psychotic symptom lasting longer than\none week). For this analysis, and similar to CHR-P samples, CORS symptoms related to altered\nbeliefs (odd beliefs, delusions, paranoia/suspiciousness) were considered on the delusion\nspectrum; altered perceptions and hallucinations were considered on the hallucination spectrum. In\naddition to the retrospective symptom reports, patients were prospectively assessed for psychotic\nsymptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)38 at intake and then\nat months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24, for a total of 12 timepoints. For the purposes of this study,\nthe presence or absence of hallucinations and delusions in the prospective sample was\nestablished using SAPS questions 7 (global assessment of hallucinations) and 20 (global\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nassessment of delusions); scores of 0 (none) and 1 (questionable) were coded as ‘absent’ and\nscores of 2 (mild) and above were coded as present. As not all subjects had data at each\ntimepoint, analysis at each timepoint was based on the subjects who had provided data at that\ntime.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDifferent pathways en route to a condition can influence the timing and variability of symptom\nexpression41. We sought to determine if hallucinations and delusions exhibited different patterns of\nvariability over time, which could support the possibility of different pathways toward symptom\nexpression. First, we analyzed variability in the severity scores of delusions and hallucinations\nacross subjects over time. The standard deviation of individual symptom scores over time was\ncomputed and then compared using a t-test for independent samples (Fig. 2a,d,g). Next, we\nexamined variability in the pattern of occurrence of delusions and hallucinations separately over\ntime (regardless of severity) using Lempel-Ziv complexity  (LZC)42; see Supplemental Materials for\ndetails. Because our objective was to compare variability of symptom presence over time, we\nexcluded participants with fewer than 3 timepoints and those who never experienced the\nsymptoms of interest. Mean LZC, computed separately for delusions and hallucinations, was\ncompared using independent-samples t-tests (Fig. 2b,e,h; Table S23). Finally, after analyzing\nvariability both in the graded severity and binary pattern of occurrence of each symptom\nseparately, we examined the probability of transitioning between symptom states (having\ndelusions, hallucinations, neither, or both) over time (Fig. 2c,f,i). Symptom states were defined by\nthe presence or absence of each individual symptom.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIf onset of hallucination emergence is a marker of worsening clinical condition in those who already\nhave delusions, we would expect that delusion severity would also increase along with\nhallucination onset. Alternatively, if the mechanisms driving hallucinogenesis are a compensatory\nresponse to the mechanisms driving delusion formation, we might expect a decrease in delusion\nseverity with hallucination onset. We examined differences in symptom severity across symptom\nonset timepoints by aligning to hallucination onset and testing for differences across that timepoint\nusing pairwise t-tests.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn all samples studied, participants were more likely to present at baseline assessment with only\ndelusions than with only hallucinations (Fig. 1, Tables S2, S6 and S11; NAPLS 2: OR = 5.6, CI95\n3.52 - 7.27; NAPLS 3: OR = 11.11, CI95: 6.97 - 17.71; PEPP: OR = 42.75, CI95: 18.81 - 97.19). On\nexamination of retrospective reports, delusions also occurred as a first symptom more frequently\nthan hallucinations across all samples (Fig. 1, dotted line; NAPLS 2: OR = 4.09, CI95 3.20 - 5.23;\nNAPLS 3 OR = 4.14, CI95 3.24-5.28; PEPP Z = 7.01, P < 0.001 (first prodromal symptom) = 4.04,\nCI95 2.77 - 5.90). Elapsed time between first and second symptom onset did not differ significantly\nbetween groups (see Supplemental Results, Table S22).\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAs  shown  in  Figure  1,  participants’  symptom  profiles  evolved  in  both  prospective  datasets,  with\nsymptoms appearing, resolving, and re-emerging over time (Tables S18 to S20). We investigated\nthese patterns in all samples (Fig. 2).\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe first examined the variance in symptom scores over time for delusions and hallucinations.\nHallucinations exhibited a higher mean standard deviation over time than delusions in both CHR-P\nsamples (Fig. 2a,d; NAPLS 2: T718 = 4.836, NAPLS 3: T559 = 3.397, Ps < 0.001). Delusions\nexhibited a higher mean standard deviation over time in the first-episode psychosis sample (Fig.\n2g; PEPP: T1069 = 2.884, P = 0.004); this may have been influenced by a floor effect in\nhallucination ratings in this sample (Fig. S3).\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNext, we examined the complexity of patterns of delusion and hallucination occurrence–how much\neach symptom appeared and disappeared over time, measured by Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC).\nWe found that the LZC of the symptom expression pattern was significantly higher in hallucinations\ncompared to delusions in both CHR-P samples (Fig. 2b, NAPLS 2: T718 = 2.175, P = 0.029; Fig.\n2e, NAPLS 3 T559 = 2.113, P = 0.035) but not in the first-episode sample (T1069 = 0.6118, P =\n0.0541, Fig. 2h, Table S23).\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHallucinations tend to re-emerge after re-emergence of delusions and resolve more quickly.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nInitial emergence of hallucinations and delusions can only be observed once per participant.\nHowever, because participants in all samples were followed over time, it was possible to determine\nwhether patterns of symptom re-emergence across the whole sample recapitulated initial patterns\nof emergence.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe order of re-emergence and resolution of symptoms over time echoed patterns seen on initial\nsymptom emergence. In all samples’ prospective data, participants were more likely to transition\nfrom a state of having no symptoms to having delusions alone compared to hallucinations alone\n(Fig. 2c; Z NAPLS 2 = 2.2692, P = 0.023, Fig. 2f; Z NAPLS 3  = 3.008, P = 0.003, Fig. 2i; Z PEPP =\n9.9216, P < 0.001, Table 21). In the opposite direction, hallucination resolution was also more\nlikely than delusion resolution from a state of having both delusions and hallucinations (Z NAPLS 2\n=6.7021, ZNAPS 3  = 7.0841, ZPEPP = 5.0529, Ps < 0.001).\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe next examined the relationship between symptoms at time of initial hallucination onset among\nCHR-P individuals who developed hallucinations while being followed prospectively (Fig. 3).\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe initial emergence of hallucinations was found to be preceded by a period of supra-threshold\ndelusion intensity, followed by a decrease in both delusion and hallucination intensity after\nhallucination onset in both the NAPLS 2 (Fig. 3a) and NAPLS 3 (Fig. 3b) samples (combined\nNAPLS 2 and NAPLS 3 samples, pairwise T43 = 2.831, P = 0.007). This pattern was observed in\nthose whose symptoms ultimately remitted  (T15 = 3.727, P = 0.002) but not in those whose\nsymptoms persisted or worsened over time (T24 = .492, P = 0.627; Fig. S1).\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nExamining the temporal order of psychotic symptom emergence has the potential to deepen our\nunderstanding of both phenomenology and the mechanisms driving those symptoms. Consistent\npatterns of emergence and resolution may help to establish a pathophysiological model for\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsymptom development within psychosis,43,44 ultimately shifting the focus of intervention from\nsymptom alleviation to interruption of the pathophysiological processes leading to disease.45–48\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAcross three large samples of individuals in the earliest phases of psychosis, each using\nretrospective and prospective approaches to symptom measurement, delusions emerge before\nhallucinations in the majority of those studied. Delusions similarly re-emerge before hallucinations\nafter initial symptoms have remitted, recapitulating the patterns of initial emergence. Hallucinations\nexhibit a noisier symptom profile, with later emergence and higher symptom volatility over the\nCHR-P period. Lastly, rather than increasing following hallucination onset, the severity of delusions\ndecreases with hallucination onset in both prospective CHR-P samples. Together, these results\nprovide converging evidence that hallucination emergence may be a secondary (i.e.,\ncompensatory) response to the factors driving delusion formation in a majority of individuals in the\nearliest phases of psychosis.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWhile perhaps surprising, this possibility is consistent with emerging work in computational\npsychiatry, which has related the constituent positive symptoms to distinct and opposing\nalterations in learning and perceptual inference:10,49,50 delusions may initially form as the result of\ninappropriate learning spurred by aberrant bottom-up noise driving experiences of aberrant\nsalience or prediction-error signaling,27,50–54 whereas hallucinations have consistently been\nassociated with a top-down dominance of expectations (or priors) in perception,49,55–57 which also\ntracks with symptom severity over time.58 Although these mechanisms appear to be in\ncontradiction, we9 and others10,59 have proposed that they may simply be separated in time:\nhallucinations and top-down dominance may be the result of processes attempting to compensate\nfor the pre-existing bottom-up noise that first drives delusion formation. In this rendering, delusions\nwould be expected to emerge before hallucinations in the majority of those studied, as we find\nhere. The unexpected finding that delusion severity falls with hallucination onset is also consistent\nwith this account, potentially reflecting an adaptive downweighting of noisy sensory information or\na decrease in delusion-related distress with increased confidence in existing beliefs60.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe present findings may also hint at dynamics accompanying transition to a first psychotic\nepisode. Variance in hallucination expression over the CHR-P period is higher than that of\ndelusions. This generally supports the hypothesis that hallucinations are the result of secondary\nprocesses: assuming both symptoms are the result of noisy neurobiological processes, the noise\ninherent in the pathogenesis of two (rather than one) pathophysiological processes may be\nexpected to be additive.61 It is notable that this difference is not present in the FEP sample, in\nwhich we see comparable variability of expression patterns in the two symptoms (Fig. 2h). Within\nour framework, this may denote the development of a steady state between the processes driving\ndelusions and hallucinations, but further work is required to test this idea. Despite these\ndifferences, the probabilities associated with symptom emergence, remission, and re-emergence\nremain the same: delusions emerge and re-emerge before hallucinations. The consistency of this\npattern may reflect consistency in the pathophysiological processes driving symptom formation,\nwhich is ultimately the result of the ways these underlying processes dynamically interact.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nDespite the overall patterns, there is appreciable heterogeneity in symptom onset across all\nsamples. Some individuals develop hallucinations prior to delusions and present for baseline\nascertainment with only hallucinations present. As noted in Tables S1 and S12-14, these\nindividuals may also exhibit distinct clinical features. Most notably, they are younger and have\nmilder illness and higher functioning. Identification of processes that drive differential patterns of\nsymptom emergence and how they might relate to general factors that influence functioning should\nbe a focus of future work. The observational nature of the PEPP sample limits our ability to\nevaluate the impact of antipsychotic medications in that data set, and antipsychotics were not a\nfactor in the NAPLS sample by design. The role of medications should also be better delineated in\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfuture work. Therapeutic implications of these findings may extend beyond antipsychotic use: if\nincoming noise that drives delusion formation is a primary abnormality in most people with\npsychosis, medications and psychotherapies meant to correct or cope with that abnormality before\nhallucinogenesis may be particularly promising62.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOne strength of the current work lies in its use of large samples across the phases of early\npsychosis. Because there are substantive differences between CHR-P and FEP sample\ncharacteristics,63 convergent evidence is particularly valuable. There are also significant limitations\nto our efforts. There is inherent difficulty in using broad, clinically-oriented instruments to relate to\nspecific, fine-grained neural processes driving symptom development, despite the repeatedly-\ndemonstrated utility of these instruments for predicting clinical course.36,64,65 For example, the\nSOPS P4 item includes low-level perceptual distortions in addition to hallucinations; although this\ninclusion makes it even more remarkable that we see delusions emerging before hallucinations\nacross samples, more specificity would be desirable. New consensus instruments66 that separately\nrate distress, interference, and tenacity ratings could aid future analyses. Ongoing efforts to gather\ndetailed phenotypic and neural data over time as psychosis develops offer an unprecedented\nopportunity to replicate our findings and test the hypotheses that arise from them.67\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n1.

Participants from NAPLS 3 were also assessed over two years, with more frequent\nfollow-ups: every two months in the first year and then at 18 and 24 months.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS)6 was administered to evaluate for a\npsychosis-risk syndrome Presence of CHR-P corresponded to: 1) attenuated positive symptoms (APS) or\nfully psychotic positive symptoms occurring within a very brief period of time; and/or 2) decline in global\nfunctioning with schizotypal personality disorder earlier than age 19; and/or 3) a family history of\nschizophrenia-spectrum illness accompanied by a decline in functioning. The final sample consisted of\nonly individuals meeting criteria for APS. The SIPS is accompanied by an instrument, the Scale of\nProdromal Symptoms (SOPS), which assists in the rating of the severity of relevant symptoms on a 7-\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npoint scale ranging from absent (scores from 0 to 2), moderate to severe but not psychotic (CHR-P level,\n3 to 5) and severe and psychotic (score of 6). The SOPS gauges several distinct categories of prodromal\nsymptom domains including positive (unusual thoughts, suspiciousness, grandiosity, perceptual\nabnormalities, disorganized communication) and negative dimensions (social anhedonia, avolition,\nexpression of emotion, experience of emotions and self, ideational richness, occupational functioning).\nRatings of positive symptoms in the range of 3 to 5 are required for designation as being at CHR-P.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAs has been done previously,7 P1 (unusual thoughts) and P2 (suspiciousness) ratings were taken as\nsignifying the presence of early delusional ideation. P1 and P2 intensity has been shown to predict\ndelusion formation7 and progression of illness to psychosis.8–10 P4 (perceptual abnormalities) ratings were\ntaken as ratings of early hallucinatory phenomena. The maximum score for either P1 or P2 was used for\nsubsequent analyses. Those with P1 or P2 scores between 3 and 5 at baseline who did not meet criteria for\nP4 were classified as participants with only delusions. Participants with P4 scores between 3 and 5 at\nbaseline who did not meet criteria on P1 or P2 were categorized as those with only hallucinations. During\nthe analysis, we did not consider grandiose ideas (P3). We made this decision based on the following\nfactors: a) Grandiose ideas occur less frequently than P1 and P2  at baseline (symptoms at baseline in the\nrange of 3 to 5, NAPLS 2, P1 = 82.3%, P2= 67.5%, P3 = 16.3%,  NAPLS 3, P1 = 89.99%, P2 = 72.96%\nand P3 = 17.88%) and they have a significant but not complete overlap with P1, P2, and P4 (96.58% in\nNAPLS 2 and 71, 35% NAPLS 3,  P3 co-occur with P1 or P2, 13.2% in NAPLS 2 and 19.2% in NAPLS\n3 co-occur with P4). b) According to factorial analysis, P3 usually loads on a different factor than P1 and\nP211,12. This indicates that there may be a different delusional process involved in P3 than in P1 and P2. c)\nLastly, grandiose ideas have not been found to predict psychosis strongly and are not coded separately in\nthe PEPP sample using the CORS. Participants who had SOPS scores between 3 and 5 on both P4 and\neither P1 or P2 were categorized as having both delusions and hallucinations. Because the SIPS also\nelicits information on the timing of onset of symptoms that occurred at (and prior to) the baseline\nassessment, we were able to obtain information on the relative timing of onset of hallucinations and\ndelusions even in those who presented with both symptoms at baseline. Thus, we were able to identify\ntwo additional groups, those who started with hallucinations and then developed delusions and those who\ndeveloped delusions and then hallucinations. If the difference between the onset times of delusions and\nhallucinations was less than one month, we considered the participant to be in the combined-onset group.\nTo further delineate participant trajectories, we identified those participants who ultimately entered\nremission from those who did not; participants with scores lower than 3 in P1, P2, and P4 during their last\navailable visit were classified as remitters.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nPatients in the PEPP sample were assessed at baseline using the Circumstances of Onset and Relapse\nSchedule (CORS)13 which allowed for a retrospective determination of prodromal and initial psychotic\nsymptoms (the first prodromal symptom, the first psychotic symptom, and the first psychotic symptom\nlasting longer than one week). For this analysis, and similarly to what was done in the CHR-P samples,\nCORS symptoms related to altered beliefs (odd beliefs, delusions, paranoia) were considered on the\ndelusion spectrum; altered perceptions and hallucinations were considered on the hallucination spectrum.\nNote that the data available for the retrospective timepoints differs from the data collected at later\ntimepoints: the retrospective data asks about the first symptom in a given category, and definitive\ninformation about concurrent symptoms is not available.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn addition to the 3 retrospective timepoints, patients were prospectively assessed for psychotic symptoms\nusing the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)14 at intake and then at months 1, 2, 3, 6,\n9, 12, 18, and 24, for a total of 12 timepoints. For the purposes of this study, the presence or absence of\nhallucinations and delusions in the prospective sample was established using the SAPS questions 7\n(global assessment of hallucinations) and 20 (global assessment of delusions); scores of 0 (none) and 1\n(questionable) were coded as ‘absent’ and scores of 2 (mild) and above were coded as present. While\nremission of symptoms on the SAPS is often considered to be present at mild symptoms and below,15 our\nchoice for binarization was made as we were interested in following subtle changes in symptoms over\ntime that might reflect underlying computational processes. In addition, as this was a treated sample,\nexamining mild symptoms allowed for the assessment of symptoms that were present though\nsymptomatically controlled by medication, which is likely relevant to understanding symptom transitions\nover time.  As not all subjects had data at each point, analysis at each point was based on the subjects who\nhad provided data at that time.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nStatistical Analysis\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nR studio (RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA) and Python were used for all statistical analyses and visualizations,\nutilizing packages networkD3, longCatEDA, and Matplotlib.

However, the PEPP sample also included participants with other types of first\nsymptoms (e.g., disorganization or mood related), and these participants were retained for subsequent\nanalyses16,17. Proportions of participants reporting symptoms of each category as first symptoms were\ncompared using odds ratios, chi-squared tests, z-tests, and post-hoc tests adjusted for multiple\ncomparisons when applicable.

However, recent evidence suggests they may be driven by distinct computational and neural mechanisms. Examining the time course of their emergence may provide insights into the relationship between these underlying mechanisms.   Participants from the second (N = 719) and third (N = 699) iterations of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS 2 and 3) were assessed for timing of CHR-P-level delusion and hallucination onset. Pre-onset symptom patterns in first-episode psychosis patients (FEP) from the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP-Montréal; N = 694) were also assessed. Symptom onset was determined at baseline assessment and the evolution of symptom patterns examined over 24 months.   In all three samples, participants were more likely to report the onset of delusion-spectrum symptoms prior to hallucination-spectrum symptoms (odds ratios (OR): NAPLS 2 = 4.09; NAPLS 3 = 4.14; PEPP, Z = 7.01, P < 0.001) and to present with only delusions compared to only hallucinations (OR: NAPLS 2 = 5.6; NAPLS 3 = 11.11; PEPP = 42.75). Re-emergence of delusions after remission was also more common than re-emergence of hallucinations (Ps < 0.05), and hallucinations more often resolved first (Ps < 0.001). In both CHR-P samples, ratings of delusional ideation fell with the onset of hallucinations (P = 0.007).   Delusions tend to emerge before hallucinations and may play a role in their development. Further work should examine the relationship between the mechanisms driving these symptoms and its utility for diagnosis and treatment.   Hallucinations and delusions frequently co-occur in psychotic illness.1–5 Since they were first described, these two symptoms have been grouped together into what are now known as the positive symptoms of psychosis.6,7 However, emerging evidence suggests that delusions and hallucinations may be driven by distinct but related alterations in learning and inference.8–13 Understanding the dynamic interrelationships between these symptoms could allow for a more nuanced understanding of the distinct mechanisms driving their emergence.   Historically, delusions have been characterized as either primary (e.g. emerging out of delusional mood, a state in which the environment seems to have changed in some unexplainable and potentially aversive way) or as secondary to some other phenomenon (e.g. a delusion arising out of a mood state or perceptual experience).14 Broadly, cognitive models of psychosis describe delusion formation as the result of an individual’s drive to make sense of a confusing or stressful experience.15–18 One such model, the anomalous experience hypothesis, predicts that delusion formation is a response to unusual perceptual experiences or hallucinations and thus represents a (secondary) attempt by the individual to explain or understand their unusual perceptual experience.19 In this view, delusions may be the product of normal reasoning processes used to explain confusing or potentially distressing experiences: a patient who hears a voice saying “Join the FBI” multiple times per day may be more likely to conclude and subsequently believe that the FBI is following her. While data exist that support this hypothesis and cognitive models of psychotic symptoms broadly,3,20–27 these studies are somewhat limited by general-population sampling and cross-sectional designs.   Indirect evidence from the putatively prodromal Clinical High-Risk state for psychosis (CHR-P) indicates that hallucinations and delusions may not emerge at the same time: they co-occur much more frequently after the onset of threshold-level psychosis.1,2,5 Additionally, delusional ideation is present in nearly all participants with perceptual abnormalities, but perceptual abnormalities are present in only some individuals with delusional ideation.5,28 However, no known studies have directly examined the relative timing of symptom onset during and directly following symptom emergence. Ideally, longitudinal data would be obtained from large, naturalistically followed samples of individuals when positive symptoms are actively and acutely emerging. Doing so would allow for a more detailed and accurate understanding of symptom emergence and evolution within the natural history of psychosis.   We examined the onset and evolution of delusions and hallucinations over time in two large prospective CHR-P cohorts (N = 719 and 699) and one large retrospective (follow-back) first episode psychosis (FEP) cohort (N = 694). We investigated these questions across stages of illness in order to identify consistencies that may be present before and after psychosis onset.   All participants provided written informed consent after receiving a complete description of the constituent studies, which were approved by local ethics committees. This study included three main data sources: CHR-P participants recruited through the second and third waves of the multi- site North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS 2 and 3)29,30 and an FEP sample from the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP-Montréal),31 a Canadian   specialized early intervention service. Further sample characteristics may be found in the Supplemental Materials.   NAPLS participants who met criteria for Attenuated Positive Symptom Syndrome (APSS) with CHR-P-level (scores 3-5) on delusional ideation (i.e., SOPS items P1 Unusual Thought Content or P2 Suspiciousness or Persecutory Ideas) and/or hallucinations (SOPS item P4 Perceptual abnormalities and Hallucinations) were included. The final CHR-P samples included 719 participants from NAPLS 2 and 699 from NAPLS 3.   The PEPP sample consisted of 694 consecutive patients in their first episode of psychosis who were deemed eligible and consented to participate. For eligibility, participants were required not to have taken antipsychotic medication for greater than 30 days prior to referral. Patients with IQ < 70, psychotic illness solely related to substance use, or non-psychiatric causes of mental disorder were not enrolled in PEPP.   The Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS)34 was administered to evaluate for a psychosis-risk syndrome by certified personnel at each site. For the purposes of brevity in this paper, we will discuss hallucination- and delusion-spectrum symptoms (e.g. attenuated psychotic symptoms) as hallucinations and delusions, respectively. As has been done previously,20 CHR-P- level P1 (unusual thoughts) and P2 (suspiciousness) ratings (3-5) were taken as signifying the presence of early delusional ideation. P1 and P2 intensity has been shown to predict delusion formation20 and progression of illness to psychosis.28,35,36 CHR-P-level P4 (perceptual abnormalities) ratings (3-5) were taken as ratings of early hallucinatory phenomena. The maximum score for either P1 or P2 was used for subsequent analyses. Based on these ratings, participants were characterized as having only delusions, only hallucinations, both, or neither at each timepoint. Because the SIPS also elicits information on the timing of symptoms onset prior to baseline assessment, we were able to obtain information on the relative timing of onset of hallucinations and delusions even in those who presented with both symptoms at baseline. If the difference between the onset times of delusions and hallucinations was less than one month, we considered the participant to be in the combined-onset group. To further delineate participant trajectories, we identified those participants who ultimately entered remission from those who did not; participants with scores lower than 3 in P1, P2, and P4 during their last available visit were classified as remitters.   Patients in the PEPP sample were assessed at baseline using the Circumstances of Onset and Relapse Schedule (CORS)37, which allowed for retrospective determination of pre-onset (prodromal) and initial psychotic symptoms (the first prodromal symptom contiguous with psychosis onset), the first psychotic symptom, and the first psychotic symptom lasting longer than one week). For this analysis, and similar to CHR-P samples, CORS symptoms related to altered beliefs (odd beliefs, delusions, paranoia/suspiciousness) were considered on the delusion spectrum; altered perceptions and hallucinations were considered on the hallucination spectrum. In addition to the retrospective symptom reports, patients were prospectively assessed for psychotic symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)38 at intake and then at months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24, for a total of 12 timepoints. For the purposes of this study, the presence or absence of hallucinations and delusions in the prospective sample was established using SAPS questions 7 (global assessment of hallucinations) and 20 (global   assessment of delusions); scores of 0 (none) and 1 (questionable) were coded as ‘absent’ and scores of 2 (mild) and above were coded as present. As not all subjects had data at each timepoint, analysis at each timepoint was based on the subjects who had provided data at that time.   Different pathways en route to a condition can influence the timing and variability of symptom expression41. We sought to determine if hallucinations and delusions exhibited different patterns of variability over time, which could support the possibility of different pathways toward symptom expression. First, we analyzed variability in the severity scores of delusions and hallucinations across subjects over time. The standard deviation of individual symptom scores over time was computed and then compared using a t-test for independent samples (Fig. 2a,d,g). Next, we examined variability in the pattern of occurrence of delusions and hallucinations separately over time (regardless of severity) using Lempel-Ziv complexity  (LZC)42; see Supplemental Materials for details. Because our objective was to compare variability of symptom presence over time, we excluded participants with fewer than 3 timepoints and those who never experienced the symptoms of interest. Mean LZC, computed separately for delusions and hallucinations, was compared using independent-samples t-tests (Fig. 2b,e,h; Table S23). Finally, after analyzing variability both in the graded severity and binary pattern of occurrence of each symptom separately, we examined the probability of transitioning between symptom states (having delusions, hallucinations, neither, or both) over time (Fig. 2c,f,i). Symptom states were defined by the presence or absence of each individual symptom.   If onset of hallucination emergence is a marker of worsening clinical condition in those who already have delusions, we would expect that delusion severity would also increase along with hallucination onset. Alternatively, if the mechanisms driving hallucinogenesis are a compensatory response to the mechanisms driving delusion formation, we might expect a decrease in delusion severity with hallucination onset. We examined differences in symptom severity across symptom onset timepoints by aligning to hallucination onset and testing for differences across that timepoint using pairwise t-tests.   In all samples studied, participants were more likely to present at baseline assessment with only delusions than with only hallucinations (Fig. 1, Tables S2, S6 and S11; NAPLS 2: OR = 5.6, CI95 3.52 - 7.27; NAPLS 3: OR = 11.11, CI95: 6.97 - 17.71; PEPP: OR = 42.75, CI95: 18.81 - 97.19). On examination of retrospective reports, delusions also occurred as a first symptom more frequently than hallucinations across all samples (Fig. 1, dotted line; NAPLS 2: OR = 4.09, CI95 3.20 - 5.23; NAPLS 3 OR = 4.14, CI95 3.24-5.28; PEPP Z = 7.01, P < 0.001 (first prodromal symptom) = 4.04, CI95 2.77 - 5.90). Elapsed time between first and second symptom onset did not differ significantly between groups (see Supplemental Results, Table S22).   As  shown  in  Figure  1,  participants’  symptom  profiles  evolved  in  both  prospective  datasets,  with symptoms appearing, resolving, and re-emerging over time (Tables S18 to S20). We investigated these patterns in all samples (Fig. 2).   We first examined the variance in symptom scores over time for delusions and hallucinations. Hallucinations exhibited a higher mean standard deviation over time than delusions in both CHR-P samples (Fig. 2a,d; NAPLS 2: T718 = 4.836, NAPLS 3: T559 = 3.397, Ps < 0.001). Delusions exhibited a higher mean standard deviation over time in the first-episode psychosis sample (Fig. 2g; PEPP: T1069 = 2.884, P = 0.004); this may have been influenced by a floor effect in hallucination ratings in this sample (Fig. S3).   Next, we examined the complexity of patterns of delusion and hallucination occurrence–how much each symptom appeared and disappeared over time, measured by Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC). We found that the LZC of the symptom expression pattern was significantly higher in hallucinations compared to delusions in both CHR-P samples (Fig. 2b, NAPLS 2: T718 = 2.175, P = 0.029; Fig. 2e, NAPLS 3 T559 = 2.113, P = 0.035) but not in the first-episode sample (T1069 = 0.6118, P = 0.0541, Fig. 2h, Table S23).   Hallucinations tend to re-emerge after re-emergence of delusions and resolve more quickly.   Initial emergence of hallucinations and delusions can only be observed once per participant. However, because participants in all samples were followed over time, it was possible to determine whether patterns of symptom re-emergence across the whole sample recapitulated initial patterns of emergence.   The order of re-emergence and resolution of symptoms over time echoed patterns seen on initial symptom emergence. In all samples’ prospective data, participants were more likely to transition from a state of having no symptoms to having delusions alone compared to hallucinations alone (Fig. 2c; Z NAPLS 2 = 2.2692, P = 0.023, Fig. 2f; Z NAPLS 3  = 3.008, P = 0.003, Fig. 2i; Z PEPP = 9.9216, P < 0.001, Table 21). In the opposite direction, hallucination resolution was also more likely than delusion resolution from a state of having both delusions and hallucinations (Z NAPLS 2 =6.7021, ZNAPS 3  = 7.0841, ZPEPP = 5.0529, Ps < 0.001).   We next examined the relationship between symptoms at time of initial hallucination onset among CHR-P individuals who developed hallucinations while being followed prospectively (Fig. 3).   The initial emergence of hallucinations was found to be preceded by a period of supra-threshold delusion intensity, followed by a decrease in both delusion and hallucination intensity after hallucination onset in both the NAPLS 2 (Fig. 3a) and NAPLS 3 (Fig. 3b) samples (combined NAPLS 2 and NAPLS 3 samples, pairwise T43 = 2.831, P = 0.007). This pattern was observed in those whose symptoms ultimately remitted  (T15 = 3.727, P = 0.002) but not in those whose symptoms persisted or worsened over time (T24 = .492, P = 0.627; Fig. S1).   Examining the temporal order of psychotic symptom emergence has the potential to deepen our understanding of both phenomenology and the mechanisms driving those symptoms. Consistent patterns of emergence and resolution may help to establish a pathophysiological model for   symptom development within psychosis,43,44 ultimately shifting the focus of intervention from symptom alleviation to interruption of the pathophysiological processes leading to disease.45–48   Across three large samples of individuals in the earliest phases of psychosis, each using retrospective and prospective approaches to symptom measurement, delusions emerge before hallucinations in the majority of those studied. Delusions similarly re-emerge before hallucinations after initial symptoms have remitted, recapitulating the patterns of initial emergence. Hallucinations exhibit a noisier symptom profile, with later emergence and higher symptom volatility over the CHR-P period. Lastly, rather than increasing following hallucination onset, the severity of delusions decreases with hallucination onset in both prospective CHR-P samples. Together, these results provide converging evidence that hallucination emergence may be a secondary (i.e., compensatory) response to the factors driving delusion formation in a majority of individuals in the earliest phases of psychosis.   While perhaps surprising, this possibility is consistent with emerging work in computational psychiatry, which has related the constituent positive symptoms to distinct and opposing alterations in learning and perceptual inference:10,49,50 delusions may initially form as the result of inappropriate learning spurred by aberrant bottom-up noise driving experiences of aberrant salience or prediction-error signaling,27,50–54 whereas hallucinations have consistently been associated with a top-down dominance of expectations (or priors) in perception,49,55–57 which also tracks with symptom severity over time.58 Although these mechanisms appear to be in contradiction, we9 and others10,59 have proposed that they may simply be separated in time: hallucinations and top-down dominance may be the result of processes attempting to compensate for the pre-existing bottom-up noise that first drives delusion formation. In this rendering, delusions would be expected to emerge before hallucinations in the majority of those studied, as we find here. The unexpected finding that delusion severity falls with hallucination onset is also consistent with this account, potentially reflecting an adaptive downweighting of noisy sensory information or a decrease in delusion-related distress with increased confidence in existing beliefs60.   The present findings may also hint at dynamics accompanying transition to a first psychotic episode. Variance in hallucination expression over the CHR-P period is higher than that of delusions. This generally supports the hypothesis that hallucinations are the result of secondary processes: assuming both symptoms are the result of noisy neurobiological processes, the noise inherent in the pathogenesis of two (rather than one) pathophysiological processes may be expected to be additive.61 It is notable that this difference is not present in the FEP sample, in which we see comparable variability of expression patterns in the two symptoms (Fig. 2h). Within our framework, this may denote the development of a steady state between the processes driving delusions and hallucinations, but further work is required to test this idea. Despite these differences, the probabilities associated with symptom emergence, remission, and re-emergence remain the same: delusions emerge and re-emerge before hallucinations. The consistency of this pattern may reflect consistency in the pathophysiological processes driving symptom formation, which is ultimately the result of the ways these underlying processes dynamically interact.   Despite the overall patterns, there is appreciable heterogeneity in symptom onset across all samples. Some individuals develop hallucinations prior to delusions and present for baseline ascertainment with only hallucinations present. As noted in Tables S1 and S12-14, these individuals may also exhibit distinct clinical features. Most notably, they are younger and have milder illness and higher functioning. Identification of processes that drive differential patterns of symptom emergence and how they might relate to general factors that influence functioning should be a focus of future work. The observational nature of the PEPP sample limits our ability to evaluate the impact of antipsychotic medications in that data set, and antipsychotics were not a factor in the NAPLS sample by design. The role of medications should also be better delineated in   future work. Therapeutic implications of these findings may extend beyond antipsychotic use: if incoming noise that drives delusion formation is a primary abnormality in most people with psychosis, medications and psychotherapies meant to correct or cope with that abnormality before hallucinogenesis may be particularly promising62.   One strength of the current work lies in its use of large samples across the phases of early psychosis. Because there are substantive differences between CHR-P and FEP sample characteristics,63 convergent evidence is particularly valuable. There are also significant limitations to our efforts. There is inherent difficulty in using broad, clinically-oriented instruments to relate to specific, fine-grained neural processes driving symptom development, despite the repeatedly- demonstrated utility of these instruments for predicting clinical course.36,64,65 For example, the SOPS P4 item includes low-level perceptual distortions in addition to hallucinations; although this inclusion makes it even more remarkable that we see delusions emerging before hallucinations across samples, more specificity would be desirable. New consensus instruments66 that separately rate distress, interference, and tenacity ratings could aid future analyses. Ongoing efforts to gather detailed phenotypic and neural data over time as psychosis develops offer an unprecedented opportunity to replicate our findings and test the hypotheses that arise from them.67   1.

Emergence and dynamics of delusions and hallucinations across stages in early psychosis   Sample CHR-P participants met the Criteria of Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (COPS) based on the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS).1 FEP participants from PEPP-Montréal2,3 (hereinafter referred to as PEPP) were admitted to the service for a first episode of affective or non-affective psychosis between 2003 and 2018.   NAPLS 2 was conducted from 2008 to 2013. Participants were between 12 and 35 years old, and 764 met inclusion criteria for CHR-P. NAPLS 3 was conducted from 2014 to 2019. Participants were between 12 and 30 years old, and 710 met diagnostic criteria for a prodromal syndrome rated on the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS). See Addington et al. for more details about the study and sample. 4,5 From NAPLS 2, 45 participants were excluded: 25 were below CHR-P level for these symptoms and 20 scored in the psychotic-level range. From the NAPLS 3 sample, 11 were excluded: 6 scored below CHR-level for these symptoms, and 5 scored in the psychotic-level range and were designated as having Brief Intermittent Psychotic Syndrome (BIPS).   The PEPP program is publicly funded and serves a catchment area of ~300,000 people; patients are drawn from multiple referral sources, including self-referral. In the PEPP dataset, patients were between the ages of 14 and 35 at time of referral. The selected sample consisted of 694 patients at baseline.  PEPP serves as the sole first episode psychosis service in this area.The overall PEPP study received approval from the Douglas Hospital Research Centre’s research ethics board, and participants provided written informed consent to be enrolled in the PEPP cohort. 80.51% of the patients accepted into the PEPP protocol study during this time period accepted to participate in the study.   NAPLS 2 and 3   In both NAPLS 2 and 3, participants were administered various tasks, interviews, and self-report measures. Participants from NAPLS 2 were assessed at baseline and four follow-ups over two years: 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Participants from NAPLS 3 were also assessed over two years, with more frequent follow-ups: every two months in the first year and then at 18 and 24 months.   The Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS)6 was administered to evaluate for a psychosis-risk syndrome Presence of CHR-P corresponded to: 1) attenuated positive symptoms (APS) or fully psychotic positive symptoms occurring within a very brief period of time; and/or 2) decline in global functioning with schizotypal personality disorder earlier than age 19; and/or 3) a family history of schizophrenia-spectrum illness accompanied by a decline in functioning. The final sample consisted of only individuals meeting criteria for APS. The SIPS is accompanied by an instrument, the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS), which assists in the rating of the severity of relevant symptoms on a 7-   point scale ranging from absent (scores from 0 to 2), moderate to severe but not psychotic (CHR-P level, 3 to 5) and severe and psychotic (score of 6). The SOPS gauges several distinct categories of prodromal symptom domains including positive (unusual thoughts, suspiciousness, grandiosity, perceptual abnormalities, disorganized communication) and negative dimensions (social anhedonia, avolition, expression of emotion, experience of emotions and self, ideational richness, occupational functioning). Ratings of positive symptoms in the range of 3 to 5 are required for designation as being at CHR-P.   As has been done previously,7 P1 (unusual thoughts) and P2 (suspiciousness) ratings were taken as signifying the presence of early delusional ideation. P1 and P2 intensity has been shown to predict delusion formation7 and progression of illness to psychosis.8–10 P4 (perceptual abnormalities) ratings were taken as ratings of early hallucinatory phenomena. The maximum score for either P1 or P2 was used for subsequent analyses. Those with P1 or P2 scores between 3 and 5 at baseline who did not meet criteria for P4 were classified as participants with only delusions. Participants with P4 scores between 3 and 5 at baseline who did not meet criteria on P1 or P2 were categorized as those with only hallucinations. During the analysis, we did not consider grandiose ideas (P3). We made this decision based on the following factors: a) Grandiose ideas occur less frequently than P1 and P2  at baseline (symptoms at baseline in the range of 3 to 5, NAPLS 2, P1 = 82.3%, P2= 67.5%, P3 = 16.3%,  NAPLS 3, P1 = 89.99%, P2 = 72.96% and P3 = 17.88%) and they have a significant but not complete overlap with P1, P2, and P4 (96.58% in NAPLS 2 and 71, 35% NAPLS 3,  P3 co-occur with P1 or P2, 13.2% in NAPLS 2 and 19.2% in NAPLS 3 co-occur with P4). b) According to factorial analysis, P3 usually loads on a different factor than P1 and P211,12. This indicates that there may be a different delusional process involved in P3 than in P1 and P2. c) Lastly, grandiose ideas have not been found to predict psychosis strongly and are not coded separately in the PEPP sample using the CORS. Participants who had SOPS scores between 3 and 5 on both P4 and either P1 or P2 were categorized as having both delusions and hallucinations. Because the SIPS also elicits information on the timing of onset of symptoms that occurred at (and prior to) the baseline assessment, we were able to obtain information on the relative timing of onset of hallucinations and delusions even in those who presented with both symptoms at baseline. Thus, we were able to identify two additional groups, those who started with hallucinations and then developed delusions and those who developed delusions and then hallucinations. If the difference between the onset times of delusions and hallucinations was less than one month, we considered the participant to be in the combined-onset group. To further delineate participant trajectories, we identified those participants who ultimately entered remission from those who did not; participants with scores lower than 3 in P1, P2, and P4 during their last available visit were classified as remitters.   Patients in the PEPP sample were assessed at baseline using the Circumstances of Onset and Relapse Schedule (CORS)13 which allowed for a retrospective determination of prodromal and initial psychotic symptoms (the first prodromal symptom, the first psychotic symptom, and the first psychotic symptom lasting longer than one week). For this analysis, and similarly to what was done in the CHR-P samples, CORS symptoms related to altered beliefs (odd beliefs, delusions, paranoia) were considered on the delusion spectrum; altered perceptions and hallucinations were considered on the hallucination spectrum. Note that the data available for the retrospective timepoints differs from the data collected at later timepoints: the retrospective data asks about the first symptom in a given category, and definitive information about concurrent symptoms is not available.   In addition to the 3 retrospective timepoints, patients were prospectively assessed for psychotic symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)14 at intake and then at months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24, for a total of 12 timepoints. For the purposes of this study, the presence or absence of hallucinations and delusions in the prospective sample was established using the SAPS questions 7 (global assessment of hallucinations) and 20 (global assessment of delusions); scores of 0 (none) and 1 (questionable) were coded as ‘absent’ and scores of 2 (mild) and above were coded as present. While remission of symptoms on the SAPS is often considered to be present at mild symptoms and below,15 our choice for binarization was made as we were interested in following subtle changes in symptoms over time that might reflect underlying computational processes. In addition, as this was a treated sample, examining mild symptoms allowed for the assessment of symptoms that were present though symptomatically controlled by medication, which is likely relevant to understanding symptom transitions over time.  As not all subjects had data at each point, analysis at each point was based on the subjects who had provided data at that time.   R studio (RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA) and Python were used for all statistical analyses and visualizations, utilizing packages networkD3, longCatEDA, and Matplotlib. We constructed a Sankey diagram to depict the flow of patients to and from our established symptom categories over time using group transition frequencies at each timepoint (Fig. 1). To aid comparison with the other groups, the Sankey diagram for the PEPP sample (Fig. 1c) only included participants with a first reported prodromal symptom of delusions or hallucinations. However, the PEPP sample also included participants with other types of first symptoms (e.g., disorganization or mood related), and these participants were retained for subsequent analyses16,17. Proportions of participants reporting symptoms of each category as first symptoms were compared using odds ratios, chi-squared tests, z-tests, and post-hoc tests adjusted for multiple comparisons when applicable. Differences in clinical features were analyzed using ANOVA.   In the NAPLS 2 and 3 samples, the time elapsed between the first and second symptoms was calculated by subtracting the onset dates of the first and second symptoms. The mean onset times per symptom were compared using an independent samples t-test (Table S22).   We calculated LZC based on the binary time course of delusion and hallucination presence, considering SIPS or SAPS score > 2, as above. LZC is a measure of variability of a binary sequence; small numbers connote fewer observed patterns, while higher numbers connote greater variability in the observed patterns. The probability of discovering additional patterns in a sample is correlated with the number of measurement points taken. As our samples consist of varying measurement time points, we calculated standardized LZC scores to facilitate easy comparison between samples. Missing data points were not considered as patterns in our analysis.   Symptom presentation at Baseline   In NAPLS 2, 95.3% of the participants met the criteria for Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms, while in NAPLS 3, the percentage was 99.4%. The remaining percentages corresponded to Genetic Risk and Functional Decline psychosis-risk syndrome.",

In applica-\ntions of Frobenius manifold to these research subjects some generalizations of this geometric\nstructure arise [1, 2, 19, 26, 30, 31, 38]. Among such generalizations we have the so called\ngeneralized Frobenius manifolds with non-ﬂat unity [30, 31], which satisfy all the axioms of\nDubrovin’s deﬁnition of Frobenius manifold but the ﬂatness condition imposed on the unit\nvector ﬁelds.\nIn this paper, we refer to them simply as generalized Frobenius manifolds.\nExamples of such generalized Frobenius manifolds can be found in [4, 9, 30, 40].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIt is shown in [30] that one can associate with any generalized Frobenius manifold a\nbihamiltonian integrable hierarchy of hydrodynamic type, which is called the Principal Hi-\nerarchy of the generalized Frobenius manifold and is an analogue of the one for a usual\nFrobenius manifold [15]. Such an integrable hierarchy possesses a tau structure, and the\ntau-cover of the Principal Hierarchy admits a family of Virasoro symmetries. The condition\nof linearization of actions of the Virasoro symmetries on the tau function of the Principal\nHierarchy leads to the loop equation of the generalized Frobenius manifold, which is shown\nto have a unique solution under the assumption of semisimplicity [30]. The solution of the\nloop equation yields a quasi-Miura transformation which transforms the Principal Hierar-\nchy of the semisimple generalized Frobenius manifold to its topological deformation.\nIn\n[30, 31, 32] the topological deformations of the Principal Hierarchies of two particular ex-\namples of generalized Frobenius manifolds are studied, it turns out that they contain the\nVolterra hierarchy, the q-deformed KdV hierarchy and the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy, which\nare discrete integrable hierarchies well known in the theory of soliton equation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn the present paper, we study the relationship between the integrable hierarchies as-\nsociated with two generalized Frobenius manifolds which are related by a Legendre-type\ntransformation. Such a kind of transformations for Frobenius manifolds were originally in-\ntroduced by Dubrovin in [10] based on symmetries of the WDVV equations of associativity.\nEach Legendre-type transformation is determined by an invertible ﬂat vector ﬁeld of the\nFrobenius manifold that is under consideration, and it transforms the given Frobenius man-\nifold to another one. As it is shown in [45], these two Frobenius manifolds share the same\nmonodromy data, and their Principal Hierarchies are related by a certain linear reciprocal\ntransformation. Moreover, if these two Frobenius manifolds are semisimple, the topological\ndeformations of their Principal Hierarchies are also related by the same linear reciprocal\ntransformation, and share the same deformed tau structure.\nIn [42], Strachan and Sted-\nman generalized Dubrovin’s Legendre-type transformations of Frobenius manifolds. Such a\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngeneralized Legendre-type transformation is determined by an invertible vector ﬁeld, which\nsatisﬁes a certain set of deﬁning conditions and is called a Legendre ﬁeld.\nIn general, a\nLegendre ﬁeld is non-ﬂat with respect to the ﬂat metric of the Frobenius manifold under\nconsideration, and the associated Legendre-type transformation transforms the Frobenius\nmanifold to a generalized one with non-ﬂat unity, moreover, one can apply such a transfor-\nmation to any generalized Frobenius manifold.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn order to establish a relationship between the integrable hierarchies associated with\ntwo generalized Frobenius manifold that are related by a generalized Legendre-type trans-\nformation (which we will simply call a Legendre-type transformation), we need to extend\nthe Principal Hierarchies of the generalized Frobenius manifolds by some ﬂows that are\nconstructed from the Legendre ﬁeld, and we call these extended integrable hierarchies the\nLegendre-extended Principal Hierarchies of the generalized Frobenius manifolds. We show\nthat these Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies of the generalized Frobenius manifolds\nare related by a linear reciprocal transformation, and they also possess tau-covers and Vi-\nrasoro symmetries. We also show that the corresponding linearization conditions of the\nactions of the Virasoro symmetries on the tau function of the Legendre-extended Principal\nHierarchies lead to the same loop equations that are derived in [31]. In the case when the\ngeneralized Frobenius manifolds are semisimple, we show that the topological deformations of\ntheir Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies are also related by the same linear reciprocal\ntransformation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we recall the notion and main properties\nof Legendre-type transformations introduced in [42]. In Sect. 3, we construct the Legendre-\nextended Principal Hierarchy and its tau structures for a generalized Frobenius manifold, and\nestablish the relationship of the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies of two generalized\nFrobenius manifolds that are related by a Legendre-type transformation. In Sect. 4, we study\nthe Virasoro symmetries and the topological deformations of the Legendre-extended Principal\nHierarchies, and establish the relationships between these integrable hierarchies under the\nIn Sect. 5 and Sect. 6, we present two important examples, one\nsemisimplicity condition.\nrelates the KdV hierarchy with the q-deformed KdV hierarchy, while the other one relates\nthe Toda hierarchy with the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy.

Since Dubrovin introduced the notion of Frobenius manifold in the early1990s [10, 11], this geometric structure has been playing important roles in diﬀerent research subjects of math- ematical physics, such as Gromov-Witten theory, singularity theory and integrable systems, see for example [3, 5, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 33, 41] and references therein. In applica- tions of Frobenius manifold to these research subjects some generalizations of this geometric structure arise [1, 2, 19, 26, 30, 31, 38]. Among such generalizations we have the so called generalized Frobenius manifolds with non-ﬂat unity [30, 31], which satisfy all the axioms of Dubrovin’s deﬁnition of Frobenius manifold but the ﬂatness condition imposed on the unit vector ﬁelds. In this paper, we refer to them simply as generalized Frobenius manifolds. Examples of such generalized Frobenius manifolds can be found in [4, 9, 30, 40].   It is shown in [30] that one can associate with any generalized Frobenius manifold a bihamiltonian integrable hierarchy of hydrodynamic type, which is called the Principal Hi- erarchy of the generalized Frobenius manifold and is an analogue of the one for a usual Frobenius manifold [15]. Such an integrable hierarchy possesses a tau structure, and the tau-cover of the Principal Hierarchy admits a family of Virasoro symmetries. The condition of linearization of actions of the Virasoro symmetries on the tau function of the Principal Hierarchy leads to the loop equation of the generalized Frobenius manifold, which is shown to have a unique solution under the assumption of semisimplicity [30]. The solution of the loop equation yields a quasi-Miura transformation which transforms the Principal Hierar- chy of the semisimple generalized Frobenius manifold to its topological deformation. In [30, 31, 32] the topological deformations of the Principal Hierarchies of two particular ex- amples of generalized Frobenius manifolds are studied, it turns out that they contain the Volterra hierarchy, the q-deformed KdV hierarchy and the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy, which are discrete integrable hierarchies well known in the theory of soliton equation.   In the present paper, we study the relationship between the integrable hierarchies as- sociated with two generalized Frobenius manifolds which are related by a Legendre-type transformation. Such a kind of transformations for Frobenius manifolds were originally in- troduced by Dubrovin in [10] based on symmetries of the WDVV equations of associativity. Each Legendre-type transformation is determined by an invertible ﬂat vector ﬁeld of the Frobenius manifold that is under consideration, and it transforms the given Frobenius man- ifold to another one. As it is shown in [45], these two Frobenius manifolds share the same monodromy data, and their Principal Hierarchies are related by a certain linear reciprocal transformation. Moreover, if these two Frobenius manifolds are semisimple, the topological deformations of their Principal Hierarchies are also related by the same linear reciprocal transformation, and share the same deformed tau structure. In [42], Strachan and Sted- man generalized Dubrovin’s Legendre-type transformations of Frobenius manifolds. Such a   generalized Legendre-type transformation is determined by an invertible vector ﬁeld, which satisﬁes a certain set of deﬁning conditions and is called a Legendre ﬁeld. In general, a Legendre ﬁeld is non-ﬂat with respect to the ﬂat metric of the Frobenius manifold under consideration, and the associated Legendre-type transformation transforms the Frobenius manifold to a generalized one with non-ﬂat unity, moreover, one can apply such a transfor- mation to any generalized Frobenius manifold.   In order to establish a relationship between the integrable hierarchies associated with two generalized Frobenius manifold that are related by a generalized Legendre-type trans- formation (which we will simply call a Legendre-type transformation), we need to extend the Principal Hierarchies of the generalized Frobenius manifolds by some ﬂows that are constructed from the Legendre ﬁeld, and we call these extended integrable hierarchies the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies of the generalized Frobenius manifolds. We show that these Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies of the generalized Frobenius manifolds are related by a linear reciprocal transformation, and they also possess tau-covers and Vi- rasoro symmetries. We also show that the corresponding linearization conditions of the actions of the Virasoro symmetries on the tau function of the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies lead to the same loop equations that are derived in [31]. In the case when the generalized Frobenius manifolds are semisimple, we show that the topological deformations of their Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies are also related by the same linear reciprocal transformation.   The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we recall the notion and main properties of Legendre-type transformations introduced in [42]. In Sect. 3, we construct the Legendre- extended Principal Hierarchy and its tau structures for a generalized Frobenius manifold, and establish the relationship of the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies of two generalized Frobenius manifolds that are related by a Legendre-type transformation. In Sect. 4, we study the Virasoro symmetries and the topological deformations of the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies, and establish the relationships between these integrable hierarchies under the In Sect. 5 and Sect. 6, we present two important examples, one semisimplicity condition. relates the KdV hierarchy with the q-deformed KdV hierarchy, while the other one relates the Toda hierarchy with the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy. In Sect. 7, we give some concluding remarks.   2 The generalized Legendre transformations   2.1 Legendre ﬁelds   Let M be an n-dimensional smooth manifold endowed with a generalized Frobenius manifold (GFM) structure (η, c, e), where η is a ﬂat metric on M , c : T M T M is a tensor ﬁeld of (1, 2)-type, e is a vector ﬁeld on M , and the triple (η, c, e) is required to satisfy the following conditions:   1. For each p   M , (η, c, e) yields a Frobenius algebra structure on TpM with unity e(p).   2. Denote by   ∇ ˜c(X, Y, Z) = notations   the Levi-Civita connection of η, and by ˜c the (0, 3)-tensor deﬁned by ˜c is a symmetric 4-tensor. Here we use the short X h   e = 0 imposed on the unit vector ﬁeld e and the existence Note that the ﬂatness condition of an Euler vector ﬁeld in Dubrovin’s deﬁnition of a Frobenius manifold [10] are not assumed here, and this notion of generalized Frobenius manifold coincides with the one given in [31] except for the existence of an Euler vector ﬁeld E.   In a system of ﬂat coordinates M we have   η = ηαβ dvα   n α=1 of the metric η in a neighborhood of a point }   here and in what follows summation over repeated upper and lower Greek indices with range from 1 to n is assumed, and ∂γ = ∂ ˜c implies that there exists locally a function F (v) such that   ∂vγ . Then the symmetry property of the tensor ﬁeld   ∂vα∂vβ∂vγ , α, β, γ = 1, . . . , n,   and the associativity of the Frobenius algebra is equivalent to the fact that F (v) satisﬁes the WDVV equations   ∂vα∂vβ∂vλ ηλµ ∂3F (v)   ∂vµ∂vγ∂vδ =   ∂vδ∂vβ∂vλ ηλµ ∂3F (v)   ∂vµ∂vγ∂vα ,   for α, β, γ, δ = 1, . . . , n. As it is shown in [10], the WDVV equations possess two types of symmetries. The ﬁrst type of symmetries is given by Legendre-type transformations (see also in [13, 15, 18]), which is generalized in [42]. Another type of symmetries consists of inversion symmetries (see also in [34]), which will not be considered in the present paper.   Deﬁnition 2.1 ([42]). Let M (η, c, e) be a generalized Frobenius manifold. A solution B Vect(M ) to the equation   is called a Legendre ﬁeld.   Taking Y = e in (2.3), we arrive at   for any Legendre ﬁeld B. rewritten as   ∇ In the ﬂat coordinates v1, . . . , vn, the equation (2.3) can be   αγ∂βBγ = cδ cδ for a vector ﬁeld B = Bγ∂γ. These equations are also equivalent to   βγ) = ∂β(Bγcδ   From the above deﬁnition and the equations (2.6) it follows that we have the following two examples of Legendre ﬁelds:   Vect(M ) satisﬁes the condition   ∇ such a Legendre ﬁeld a ﬂat Legendre ﬁeld.   B = 0, then B is a Legendre ﬁeld. We call   2. The unit vector ﬁeld e = eα∂α is a Legendre ﬁeld.   Remark 2.2. Multiplying eδ := ηαδeα on both sides of (2.5), we obtain   ηαγ∂βBγ = ηβγ∂αBβ,   which implies that the Legendre ﬁeld B is locally a gradient ﬁeld, i.e., there locally exists a function ϕ on M such that   B = gradη ϕ :=   ∂vα ηαβ ∂ ∂vβ .   In particular, the unity e is locally a gradient ﬁeld (see also in [31]).   For any vector ﬁeld B on M (η, c, e), introduce a new (0, 2)-tensor ˆη =   We say B is invertible, if there exists a vector ﬁeld B− B is invertible, then   B is non-degenerate. i   1 such that B   1 = e. Note that if   Proposition 2.3 (Generalized Legendre transformation [42]). Suppose B = Bα∂α be an invertible Legendre ﬁeld on a generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e), then the following statements hold true:   1. M (ˆη, c, e) is also a generalized Frobenius manifold, and the Levi-Civita connection ˆ ∇   with respect to the new metric ˆη =   B satisﬁes the relation h i X(B   ˆvα 2. A system of ﬂat coordinates { as a solution to the equations   n α=1 with respect to the new metric ˆη can be chosen }   ∂ˆvα ∂vβ = Bγ(v)cα   βγ(v), α, β = 1, . . . , n.   Moreover, we have   ˆη = ηαβ dˆvα   3. There locally exists a function ˆF = ˆF (ˆv) on M such that   ∂3 ˆF ∂ˆvα∂ˆvβ∂ˆvγ =    and such ˆF (ˆv) can be chosen as a solution to the equation   ∂2 ˆF (ˆv) ∂ˆvα∂ˆvβ = where F (v) is deﬁned as in (2.1).   ∂2F (v) ∂vα∂vβ , α, β = 1, . . . , n,   1 is a Legendre ﬁeld on M (η, c, e), which transforms ˆη back to η.   Note that the diﬀerence between M (η, c, e) and M (ˆη, c, e) lies only in their metrics η and   ˆη, and they share the same Frobenius multiplication c and the unit vector ﬁeld e.   We say that the generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e) is quasi-homogeneous, if there C, called the Euler vector ﬁeld and the exists a vector ﬁeld E = Eα∂α and a constant d charge of M respectively, such that E = 0, and The Lie derivatives of c and η along E satisfy the relations   In other words, M (η, c, e, E) is a generalized Frobenius manifold of charge d in the sense of [31]. We assume in what follows that the Euler vector ﬁeld E is diagonalizable, so that we can choose a system of ﬂat coordinates   of η such that   where µ := diag(µ1, ..., µn) is a part of the monodromy data of M at z = 0 [10, 12, 15, 31], and the constants rα   = 0 only if µα + d   Deﬁnition 2.4 ([13]). Suppose M (η, c, e, E) is a generalized Frobenius manifold of charge d, a Legendre ﬁeld B   Vect(M ) is called quasi-homogeneous if   for a certain constant µB   We note that a ﬂat Legendre ﬁeld B = ∂   ∂vα is quasi-homogeneous, since   and the constant µB coincides with µα. The unit vector ﬁeld e is also quasi-homogeneous, d because of the identity [E, e] = e (see [31]), and µe = 2 which is also denoted by µ0 in [31].   Lemma 2.5. Suppose an invertible vector ﬁeld B on M (η, c, e, E) satisﬁes the relation (2.15), then its inverse ˆB := B−   1 satisﬁes   Proof. Using the identity [E, e] =    i e and (2.13), we have   · Ec)(B, ˆB) + B   from which it follows (2.16). The lemma is proved.   Proposition 2.6. Suppose B is an invertible quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld on the gener- alized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E) of charge d, then M (ˆη, c, e, E) is a generalized Frobe- nius manifold of charge   Proof. By using Lemma 2.7 of [42] we have   Therefore, we only need to verify that E has local form (2.14) in a certain system of ﬂat be the system of coordinate deﬁned by (2.10), then from coordinates (2.11), (2.13) and (2.16) it follows that   of ˆη. Let   L  ∂ ∂vα + ( L ∂ ∂ˆvα =   On the other hand, in the coordinate ˆv1, . . . , ˆvn the Euler vector ﬁeld E = ˆEα ∂ the relation   ∂ ˆvα satisﬁes   ∂ ˆEβ ∂ˆvα   therefore we have   ∂ ˆEβ ∂ˆvα =   ˆvα + ˆrα   for certain constants ˆrα, where ˆµα := µα. If ˆµα + translation ˆvα   ˆvα + const. The proposition is proved.   = 1, we can kill ˆrα by a certain coordinate   Remark 2.7. The relation (2.16) can be rewritten as   in terms of the new charge ˆd given in (2.17) and ˆµ ˆB :=   Given a family of Legendre ﬁelds , we are to show in this section that one can construct from it a hierarchy of pairwise commuting ﬂows, and that the the Principal Hierarchy [15, 31] of a generalized Frobenius manifold can be extended by using such ﬂows.   Deﬁnition 3.1. Suppose B = Bα∂α is a Legendre ﬁeld (not necessarily invertible, quasi- homogeneous) of M (η, c, e), then the Legendre ﬂow ∂   ∂tB generated by B is deﬁned as   ∂vα ∂tB = Bγcα   We note that the relation (2.6) implies that there locally exists functions   If B is invertible, then vα the addition of a constant. In terms of the notation of vα rewritten as   (3.2) B coincides with the coordinate ˆvα that is deﬁned in (2.10) up to B, the Legendre ﬂow (3.1) can be   ∂vα ∂tB = (vα Lemma 3.2. Let B1, B2 be any two given Legendre ﬁelds of M (η, c, e), then the associated ∂ Legendre ﬂows are commutative, i.e., ∂tB2   Proof. From (3.1) and (3.3) it follows that   ∂vα B2 ∂tB1   = ∂x (B2 ·   ∂vα B2 ∂vβ vx))α ,   where vx := vα x plication c imply that   ∂ ∂vα . Therefore the commutativity and associativity of the Frobenius multi-   vα = 0, the lemma is proved.   As a consequence, a family of Legendre ﬁelds j   commutative ﬂows the Principal Hierarchy (see details in [31])   yields a hierarchy of mutually   . An important example of such integrable hierarchies is   of a generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E), where the index set    on M satisfy the relations   gradη θ0,0 = e, α = 1, . . . , n,   gradη θ0,k+1, gradη θα,p   αβ∂γθi,p, α, β = 1, . . . , n, (i, p)   The functions   These functions also satisfy the following quasi-homogeneous conditions   Z, where d is the charge of the generalized Frobenius manifold,   for 1 and   ∈ (Rs)α ≥ is a certain family of constants which satisfy the relations   = 0 only if µα +   [µ, Rs] = sRs, d   = 0 only if q = d, and q is an odd integer, (3.14) 1 coincide with the coeﬃcients rα that appear in the expression (2.14) of the Euler ∂t0,0 deﬁned in (3.4) is given by the translation   and rα vector ﬁeld E. We also note that the ﬂow ∂ along the spatial variable x, i.e.,   ∂vα ∂t0,0 = vα x , so in what follows we will identify the time variable t0,0 with the spatial variable x, i.e.,   Introduce the gradient ﬁelds   then we have   Note that the recursion relations (3.8) imply that   for all (i, p)   Vect(M ), and (3.9), (3.10) imply that   for all 1 ≥ satisfy the following normalization conditions:   Z. The functions θα,p that are constructed in [31] also   = ηαβ, α, β = 1, . . . , n,   Proposition 3.3. The vector ﬁelds ξi,p with (i, p) Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E).   are Legendre ﬁelds of the generalized   Proof. For each X, Y   Vect(M ), from (3.18) it follows that   here ξα,   · ∇ n. Hence B := ξi,p satisﬁes (2.3), the proposition is proved.   As a Legendre ﬁeld, ξi,p may not be quasi-homogeneous in general, because the constants α, rε It is easy to see that the ﬂow ∂   s in (3.19), (3.20) may not vanish.   ∂ti,p in the Principal Hierarchy (3.4) coincides with the In other words, the   Legendre ﬂow ∂ ∂tξi,p that is deﬁned in (3.1) via the vector ﬁeld ξi,p. Principal Hierarchy (3.4) is a hierarchy of Legendre ﬂows generated by   Remark 3.4. The n   n matrices   η := (ηαβ), µ := diag(µ1, µ2, ..., µn), Rs :=   form the monodromy data [10, 12, 15, 31] of the generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E) at z = 0. Let us introduce the n   1 column matrices   and the (n + 2)   (n + 2) matrices    e here we denote Rs = 0 when s   Then the relations (3.12)–(3.14) can be rewritten as   η, µ, and the matrices M ∼= C nius manifold of the Frobenius manifold structure on e e   1) form the monodromy data of an (n + 2)-dimensional Frobe- C that is associated with M at z = 0. The explicit construction M can be found in [31], see also in [39].   Given a Legendre ﬁeld of a generalized Frobenius manifold, we are to construct in this subsection a family of Legendre ﬁelds and extend the Principal Hierarchy by adding to it the associated Legendre ﬂows. To this end, we ﬁrst present the following lemma which is a generalized version of Proposition 2.6 given in [42].   Lemma 3.5. Suppose B is a Legendre ﬁeld on a generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e), then we have   eB is also a Legendre ﬁeld.   2. There locally exists a Legendre ﬁeld B+ satisfying the relation   Proof. We note that the (1, 3)-tensor   c has the symmetry property   X1c(X2, X3). In particular,   ec)(X, Y ) = ( ( ∇ ∇ Y XY ( ∇   Vect(M ). Thus, for a given Legendre ﬁeld B, by using the ﬂatness   − holds true for all X, Y of the Levi-Civita connection   of η and by using (2.4), (3.26), we obtain   Y B + ∇ eB) + [Y, e] eB + (   ec)(Y, ∇ Y e + [Y, e]) Y   eB + [Y, e] eB   Therefore we have   which implies that   eB is a Legendre ﬁeld. ∇ Suppose B+ = vα B∂α is a solution to the system of equations (3.2), then we have   so B+ is also a Legendre ﬁeld. The lemma is proved.   Taking X = e in (3.25), we obtain   for the solution B+ to (3.25). We also note that such a B+ is not unique, since for an X = 0, or locally X = X α∂α for constants X α), B+ + X arbitrary ﬂat vector ﬁeld X (i.e. is also a solution to (3.25).   Let B be a Legendre ﬁeld of M (η, c, e), then from the above lemma we know the existence   of a family of Legendre ﬁelds   Z such that   for all q of functions   ∈ Z such that ∈   Vect(M ). From Remark 2.2 we also know that there exists a family   Then in the ﬂat coordinates v1, . . . , vn the relation (3.28) can be rewritten in the form   ξB,q = gradη θB,q,   αβ∂γθB,q, α, β = 1, . . . , n, q   Now let us consider the quasi-homogeneous case. Suppose B be a quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld of the generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E) of charge d, and µB be the parameter that is given by (2.15), then the above-mentioned vector ﬁelds Z can be speciﬁed by the following proposition.   Proposition 3.6. Let B be a quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld of the generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E), then there exists a family of Legendre ﬁelds Z satisfying the relations (3.27), (3.28), and the following additional equations:   is a set of constants satisfying the condition   = 0 only if µα   B;s coincide with ξα,q, (Rs)β Proof. We ﬁrst consider special cases. If B = ∂ in (3.9)–(3.20), here ξα,q := 0 if q < 0; in the cases when B = e, the corresponding ξB,q, rα coincide with ξ0,q, rα s .   For a generic quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld B, the proof of the existence of ξB,q, rα B;s is similar to that of the case B = e, the details of which can be found in [31] and we omit here. The proposition is proved.   Remark 3.7. The equation (3.31) implies that the functions θB,q that are deﬁned by (3.29) satisfy the equations   where a10;q are some constants. We can adjust the functions θB,q, if needed, by adding to them certain constant terms so that the constants a10;q satisfy the condition   only if µB   We introduce the n   Deﬁnition 3.8. Let B be a quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld of a generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E) of charge d.   1. A family of vector ﬁelds ΞB :=   satisfying the relations (3.17)–(3.21) and (3.27)–(3.31) is called a Legendre-extended calibration of (M, B).   2. The family of constants   2 , µB, Rs, rs, rB;s that are given in (2.15), (3.19)–(3.20), (3.22), (3.31), (3.35) satisfying the relations (3.12)–(3.13) and (3.32) is  called the basic data for the Legendre-extended calibration ΞB.   Deﬁnition 3.9. Let B is a quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld of a generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E) of charge d, and ΞB is a Legendre-extended calibration of (M, B), then the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchy of M (η, c, e, E) with respect to ΞB is given by the following family of evolutionary PDEs:   ∂v ∂tα,p = ξα,p 0 and q   ∂v ∂t0,q = ξ0,q Z, here we use the notations v := vα ∂   ∂v ∂tB,q = ξB,q   The above hierarchy can be written in the form   for 1 ≥ as in (3.8)–(3.10) and (3.29)–(3.33). Let us introduce the index set   B as follows   Z, where the functions θi,p, θB,q associated with ΞB are deﬁned   then the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchy (3.37) can be rewritten as   In the above convention, we have   for all (i, p)   here ξα,p := 0 if α = 1, 2, . . . n and p < 0. Moreover, the formulae (3.19)–(3.20) and (3.31) can be written uniformly in the form   if i = β if i = 0, if i = B.   Here and in what follows, Greek letters α, β, γ, . . . are always assumed to be in   and the summation   0. We remark that   p s=1 vanishes when p   , } are entries of a   certain matrix   (n + 4) which will be deﬁned later, see Remark 3.15.   Remark 3.10. As for a Frobenius manifold M with ﬂat-unity [10, 15], there is a bihamil- tonian structure on the jet space J ∞(M ) given by the compatible Hamiltonian operators   αβ a ), a = 1, 2 with   αβ 2 = gαβ∂x + Γαβ P is called the intersection form of M , and Γαβ where the contravariant metric gαβ = Eεcαβ γ = ε  are the contravariant coeﬃcients of the Levi-Civita connection of (gαβ ), see 2 − details in [10, 15] or [31]. For an invertible quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld B on M , the  Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchy (3.37) is a bihamiltonian hierarchy with respect to this bihamiltonian structure, i.e., its ﬂows are Hamiltonian systems of the form   ∂vα ∂tj,q = and they satisfy the bihamiltonian recursion relations   δHj,q δvγ , α = 1, . . . , n, (j, q)   δHi,q δvγ +    B, where the Hamiltonians Hi,q for all (i, q)   for α = 1, . . . , n and (i, q)   B are given by   3.3 Linear reciprocal transformations   θi,q+1(v(x)) dx.   Let B be an invertible quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld of a generalized Frobenius manifold M (η, c, e, E) of charge d, which will also be denoted by M in what follows. From Propositions 2.3, 2.6 we know that the Legendre transformation that is induced by B transforms M to a new generalized Frobenius manifold M (ˆη, c, e, E) of charge ˆd = 2µB which will also be denoted by ˆM , and   ˆB := B− is an invertible quasi-homogeneous Legendre ﬁeld of ˆM that transforms ˆM back to M . We emphasize that M and ˆM share the same multiplication c, unity e and Euler ﬁeld E.   Now we study the relationship between the Legendre-extended calibrations of (M, B) of the metrics η and ˆη   and ( ˆM , ˆB). We ﬁrst ﬁx systems of ﬂat coordinates respectively, which are related via (2.10)–(2.11).   Theorem 3.11.

Firstly, the initial conditions (3.17), (3.27) for ˆΞ ˆB hold true, because   ˆξα,0 = ˆB ˆξ0,0 = ˆB ˆξ ˆB,0 = ˆB   ξB,0 = B− ξ0,0 = ˆB   Denote by ˆ ∇ ˆ ∇   for X ∈ also have   the Levi-Civita connection for the new metric ˆη, from (2.9) we obtain   X ˆξα,p+1 = ˆB   Vect(M ), therefore the recursion relations (3.18) for ˆξα,p hold true. Similarly, we   ˆη and the relation (2.11). Indeed, we have   The normalization condition (3.21) for ˆξα,p follows from the Deﬁnition 2.8 of the metric   z), ˆξβ(z) E z), B   ˆξβ(z) E z), ξβ(z) i   Now, from (2.13) and (2.16) we arrive at   Ec)( ˆB, ξα,p) + ˆB   In a similar way, we can verify that   therefore ˆΞ ˆB is a Legendre-extended calibration of ( ˆM , ˆB). The relations (3.44)–(3.45) for the basic data of ˆΞ ˆB follow from Proposition 2.6, Remark 2.7 and (3.46)–(3.48). The theorem is proved.   ∂ ˆθ0,q ∂ˆvα = via the densities θα,p, θ0,q and θB,q (and their ˆM -analogues) deﬁned as in (3.8)–(3.10).   ∂ ˆθα,p ∂ˆvβ =   ∂ ˆθ ˆB,q ∂ˆvα =   Theorem 3.13. Let ΞB and ˆΞ ˆB be the Legendre-extended calibrations of (M, B) and ( ˆM , ˆB). Then the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies (3.36) of ΞB and ˆΞ ˆB are related by the linear reciprocal transformation   ˆt0,q = tB,q,   Proof. Suppose v = vα ∂ we need to verify that ˆv := ˆvα ∂ Hierarchy of ˆΞ ˆB under the identiﬁcation (3.50) of time variables.   ∂vα satisﬁes the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchy (3.36) of ΞB, ∂ ˆvα satisﬁes the corresponding Legendre-extended Principal   Note that the new spatial variable ˆx is identiﬁed with the new time variable ˆt0,0, i.e.   which is analogous to (3.15). For a vector ﬁeld X Then from (2.10) we obtain   Vect(M ), we denote X α :=   ∂vβ ∂tB,0 = Bεcα   It follows from (2.11) that   Therefore, by (3.43) and the above equations we arrive at   ∂ˆv ∂ˆtα,p   ∂ˆvγ ∂ˆtα,p = Bεcγ   ∂ ∂ˆvγ = ∂ ˆB ∂vγ ·  ˆvˆx = ˆξα,p   In a similar way, we can verify that   ∂ˆv ∂ˆt ˆB,q   The theorem is proved.   In this section, we introduce the tau structure and tau-cover of the Legendre-extended Prin- cipal Hierarchy (3.36) of (M, B).   Suppose B1, B2 be two arbitrary Legendre ﬁelds of M , then by using (2.5) we have the   identities   which imply that B1 · such that   αβBβ B2 is a gradient ﬁeld, i.e. there locally exists a function ΩB1;B2 on M   In particular, for a Legendre-extended calibration   B2 = gradη ΩB1;B2.   | of (M, B), since all vector ﬁelds in ΞB are Legendre, there locally exists a family of 2-point functions   B on M such that   From the deﬁnition of the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchy we know that the above identities are equivalent to the following tau-symmetry condition [15]:   For any vector ﬁeld X   Vect(M ), from (2.13), (3.19), (3.20), (3.31) and (3.52) we obtain   − + (2 =  · = (p + q + µi + µj + 1)   gradη Ωi,p;j,q, [E, X] d)   (p + q + µi + µj + 1)Ωi,p;j,q +   B such that   s=1  X Note that the 2-point functions Ωi,p;j,q satisfying (3.52) are not unique, they have the freedom of adding constants. Now we specify the 2-point functions Ωi,p;j,q to regularize the constants Ci,p;j,q in the right hand side of (3.54) by the following steps:   Step2.

To effectively reduce high-order,\ninterconnected models, it is usually not sufficient to consider the\nsubsystems separately. Instead, structure-preserving reduction\nmethods should be employed, which consider the interconnected\ndynamics to select which subsystem dynamics to retain in\nreduction. However, structure-preserving methods are often not\ncomputationally tractable. To overcome this issue, we propose to\nconnect each subsystem model to a low-order abstraction of its\nenvironment to reduce it both effectively and efficiently. By means\nof a high-fidelity structural-dynamics model from the lithography\nindustry, we show, on the one hand, significantly increased\naccuracy with respect to standard subsystem reduction and, on\nthe other hand, similar accuracy to direct application of expen-\nsive structure-preserving methods, while significantly reducing\ncomputational cost. Furthermore, we formulate a systematic\napproach to automatically determine sufficient abstraction and\nreduction orders to preserve stability and guarantee a given\nfrequency-dependent error specification. We apply this approach\nthe\nto the lithography equipment use case and show that\nenvironment model can indeed be reduced by over 80% without\nsignificant loss in the accuracy of the reduced interconnected\nmodel.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIndex Terms—Model Reduction, Interconnected Systems, Sta-\nbility Preservation, Accuracy Guarantee, Structural Dynamics\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\nI.

Often, this interconnected system model is of such\nhigh order that dynamical analysis becomes computationally\ninfeasible and model order reduction methods are required to\napproximate the high-order model by a low-order surrogate\nmodel.

In other words, the reduced\ninterconnected system model should be constructed from re-\nduced subsystem models. This modular reduction approach\naligns with the typical design process in industry, where each\nsubsystem is largely developed separately [2]. The combi-\nnation of such modular design and model reduction allows\nfor greater flexibility of individual design teams, preservation\nof the essential structure of the interconnected system and\nincreased interpretability of the reduced system model.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe most direct and resource-efficient approach to modu-\nlar reduction involves individually reducing each subsystem\nmodel [3], i.e., in an “open-loop” sense, for which many\nstandard reduction methods exist [4–6]. This approach is\nparticularly practical because the computational cost of model\nreduction scales with the model order and the individual\nsubsystem models are clearly of lower order than the intercon-\nnected model as a whole. Even though one has to reduce mul-\ntiple lower-order subsystem models, this is usually still much\ncheaper than the reduction of one high-order interconnected\nsystem model. However, individual reduction of the separate\nsubsystem models might not retain the dynamics required\nfor the reduced, interconnected system model to accurately\napproximate its full-order model counterpart [3, 7].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo improve the accuracy of the reduced interconnected sys-\ntem model, a variety of methods [8–14] have been developed\nto reduce the interconnected system model while preserving\nits interconnection structure. These methods effectively reduce\nthe individual subsystem models in a “closed-loop” sense by\nconsidering the interconnected dynamics. Consequently, such\nstructure-preserving reduction methods successfully reduce\nthe subsystem models to lower-order models that collectively\nconstitute a low-order, interconnected model that accurately\napproximates the original, high-order model.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nUnfortunately, for many complex engineering systems the\ninterconnected system model is of such a high order, that many\nstructure-preserving reduction methods become computation-\nally infeasible.

However, as\navailable structure-preserving reduction methods evaluate the\ninterconnected model differently, i.e., not all use Gramians\n[3, 13, 14], there is no single iterative method that provides a\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo address this challenge, we introduce the framework\nof abstracted model reduction, illustrated in Figure 2c, as\nour first main contribution. The core idea is to use a low-\norder abstraction of the environment model, rather than the\noriginal, high-order environment model, to identify the sys-\ntem dynamics most relevant to the interconnected system.\nThe framework serves as a versatile solution to improve\nthe efficiency of structure-preserving reduction methods for\ninterconnected systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs a second contribution, we employ techniques from robust\nperformance theory, which have recently been applied in the\ncontext of reducing interconnected systems [17], to quanti-\ntatively assess how relying solely on an abstraction of the\nenvironment influences the resulting accuracy of the reduced\ninterconnected system model. This allows us to establish a\npriori requirements on the accuracy of both the abstracted\nenvironment model and the reduced system model, based on\nuser-defined, frequency-dependent or H∞-based specifications\non the model accuracy of the interconnected system as a\nwhole. These specifications are then leveraged to extend the\nframework of abstracted model reduction (abstracted reduction\nfor brevity) to the framework of robust abstracted reduction.\nThis latter framework automatically generates a reduced-order\nsystem model which guarantees stability of the reduced inter-\nconnected system model and guarantees the satisfaction of its\nprescribed accuracy specification.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFinally, we evaluate the abstracted model reduction frame-\nwork by an industrial case study, where we reduce a structural\ndynamics model of lithography equipment of the semiconduc-\ntor industry, consisting of several interconnected subsystem\nmodels. Through application of abstracted model reduction in\ncombination with closed-loop balanced reduction [18, 19], we\nshow that a low-order abstraction of a subsystem’s environ-\nment is sufficient to ensure the relevance of the reduced sub-\nsystem model and the accuracy of the reduced interconnected\nsystem model.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In\nSection II, the system-environment representation is presented\nand the problem is formally defined. Then, the framework of\nabstracted reduction is introduced in Section III. In this frame-\nwork, an error source is introduced both for the abstraction of\nthe environment and for the reduction of the subsystem. In\nSection IV, we relate both error sources to the resulting error\non the level of the interconnected system and use robust per-\nformance techniques to relate the different error specifications.\nThis relation is subsequently leveraged to present a systematic\napproach to abstracted reduction in Section V. Subsequently,\nin Section VI, both the general abstracted reduction framework\nand its robust extension are evaluated and compared to other\nreduction approaches from literature by means of an industrial\ncase study. Finally, Section VII presents conclusions on the\nproposed approach.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nNotation: In this paper, sets are generally indicated by\nblackboard-bold symbols, such as R, R>0 and C, which denote\nthe set of real, positive real and complex numbers, respectively.\nRm×p and Cm×p indicate matrices of real and complex\nnumbers, respectively, with m rows and p columns.

For\neach subsystem, its immediate neighbouring subsystems there-\nfore act as a lower-order surrogate for its full environment,\nconsisting of all other subsystem models. By iterating over all\nsubsystems, all reduced subsystem model retain their relevance\nwith respect to their own clusters, theoretically resulting in a\n(more) accurate reduced, interconnected model.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel, different perspective. Let\nus focus on a single subsystem, which we then denote as the\nsystem, which is embedded within an environment consisting\nof the remaining subsystems, as visualized schematically in\nFigure 1. A model for this environment is straightforwardly\nattained by the interconnection of all remaining subsystem\nmodels. Using this general system-environment model descrip-\ntion, including any system within a dynamic environment,\nwe can schematically visualize the open-loop and closed-\nloop reduction methods by Figures 2a and 2b, respectively.\nObserving the structure-preserving reduction as in Figure 2b,\nthe environment determines what essential system dynamics\nto retain (in the light of the interconnected system dynamics).\nHowever, this model for the environment is often unnecessarily\ncomplex (high order), thereby inducing computation infeasi-\nbility.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the setting of interconnected systems, E(s) typically rep-\nresents several (interconnected) subsystems such that its order\nis typically large, particularly nE > nΣ.

We have Σ(s) ∈ RH∞, E(s) ∈ RH∞\nand the interconnection Fl(E, Σ) is well-posed and internally\nstable, i.e., Σ(I − E22Σ)−1 ∈ RH∞.

In an ideal world, without compu-\ntational limitations, one would like to do direct, structure-\npreserving reduction of Fl(E, Σ). However, this is not always\nfeasible or it is computationally very expensive. Hence, we\nsuggest abstracted reduction as a framework to enable an\napproximate structure-preserving reduction, where the direct\nstructure-preserving reduction of Fl(E, Σ) is not feasible or\ntoo computationally expensive.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe augmentation with the weighting matrices Gu and\nGy in Algorithm 1 serves two main purposes: (i) to control\nthe accuracy distribution over ˆΣ and Fl(E, ˆΣ), and (ii) to\nfacilitate error analysis in Section IV. Regarding the first\npurpose, increasing the magnitudes of Gu and Gy amplifies\nthe contribution of Σ’s input-output behaviour in Fl( ˆF , Σ).\nWhen using an input-output approximating reduction method,\nhigh-magnitude Gu and Gy thus improve ˆΣ’s approximation\nof Σ at the cost of the accuracy of Fl( ˆF , ˆΣ). This trade-off\nis discussed further in Section V-C. Regarding the second-\npurpose, it turns out that extending the number inputs and\noutputs Fl( ˆE, Σ) to Fl( ˆF , Σ), by augmentation of ˆE(s) to\nˆF (s), is often essential for deriving the error relations in the\nabstracted reduction algorithm, as detailed in Section IV.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nB. Computational benefits and applicability\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo compare the computational cost of abstracted reduction\nto direct structure-preserving reduction of Fl(E, Σ), recall that\nthe model orders of E(s), ˆE(s), Σ(s) and ˆΣ(s) are denoted as\nnE, rE, nΣ and rΣ, respectively. Structure-preserving reduc-\ntion methods based on balancing, such as [9, 10], usually scale\ncubically with the order of Fl(E, Σ) [23], while structure-\npreserving methods based on LMI’s, such as [14, 24], scale\neven more steeply. Hence, our abstracted approach replaces\na cost (nE + nΣ)c with (rE + nΣ)c for c ≥ 3, i.e., the en-\nvironment is replaced by a low-order abstraction, which yields\na significant reduction in computational cost when nE is large\nand rE is small, and when nE is large compared to nΣ.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe low-order abstraction ˆE can be obtained by an inexpen-\nsive reduction method, which does not preserve structure, such\nas [25, 26], as its accuracy is not so important for the accuracy\nof the reduced, interconnected system Fl(E, ˆΣ); it merely acts\nas a weight in the reduction of Σ to ˆΣ. In such a case, the\ncomputational cost of the reduction of Σ to ˆΣ is dominant.\nThis makes abstracted reduction mostly beneficial to systems\nwhere nE > nΣ and when rE is selected as rE ≪ nE, as\nshown in Figure 5.\nRemark 1. Sometimes, Σ(s) needs to be reduced while having\nincomplete knowledge of E(s). This is a common occurrence\nin modular design processes, where several subsystems are\ndesigned simultaneously. However, these design processes are\ntypically iterative, such that we generally possess subsystem\nmodels from a previous iteration. In our abstracted approach,\nwe suggest to use ˆE(s), an approximation of E(s), to ef-\nfectively indicate which dynamics of Σ(s) are relevant to\nFl(E, Σ). Therefore, an ˆE(s) of a previous design iteration\nor even an ˆE(s) based on a basic, preliminary environment\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 4.

Then, abstracted reduction can\nbe interpreted as follows: whereas an open-loop reduction\napproach evaluates the input-output behaviour of the sys-\ntem (Σ) itself and structure-preserving reduction approach\nevaluates the coupled input-output behaviour (of Fl(E, Σ)),\nthe abstracted reduction approach uses structure-preserving\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe emphasize that we work with the error system ΛF (s) rather\nthan with ˆΣ(s) − Σ(s), for the following two reasons:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• Structure-preserving reduction methods reduce subsys-\ntems based on the coupled dynamics, such that any\navailable error bounds are typically bounds on ΛF (s).\n• As we aim to (accurately) approximate the coupled\ndynamics, the magnitude of ˆΣ − Σ cannot be expected to\nbe a good indication of the quality of reduction. Alterna-\ntively, ΛF typically gives a much better indication of the\nquality of the overall reduction, as long as ΛE is small.\nNote that if ΛE = 0, Gu = Om×m and Gy = Op×p,\nindeed ΛF = Fl(E, ˆΣ) − Fl(E, Σ). Therefore,\nif a\nspecification on the accuracy of Fl(E, ˆΣ) is translated\nto bounds on ΛE and ΛF , these bounds are expected to\nbe less conservative than similar bounds on ˆΣ − Σ.\nThe abstraction and reduction steps, characterized through\nthe errors in (6) and (7), respectively, ultimately lead to the\nreduction error ΛC of the interconnected system, as previously\nintroduced in (4) and repeated here for completeness as\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nE(s), ˆΣ(s) − Fl\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOur main goal in this section is to relate ΛC to the error\nsystems ΛE and ΛF .

Augmentation of\nE with square and invertible Gu and Gy, however, gives the\nmost convenient expression for ˆΣ, because this prevents the\ninversion of (unknown) transfer function matrices ˆF21 and ˆF12.\nUsing the lower LFT definition in (2), the expression for the\ntotal reduction error system ΛC, as in (8), can be rewritten to\n ˆΣ(I − E22 ˆΣ)−1 − Σ(I − E22Σ)−1\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nreplaced by ˆF †\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nSubstitution of ˆΣ(s) as in (9) gives an expression of ΛC in\nterms of the error system ΛF,22, as depicted schematically in\nFigure 6, where the expression for ˆΣ(s) is highlighted. This\nblock diagram facilitates an intuitive interpretation. Firstly, if\nΛF,22 = 0, the two feedback-loops with ˆE(s) cancel and\nˆΣ(s) = Σ(s). This represents the inverse relation between the\nabstraction and substitution steps of the abstracted reduction\nif ˆE22(s) = E22(s),\napproach. Also,\nthe feedback-loops\nindicated by a ∗ in Figure 6 cancel and the approach simplifies\nto standard structure-preserving reduction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe observed dependency of ΛC on ˆE22 in Figure 6\nsuggests that ˆE11, ˆE12 and ˆE21 do not influence ΛC. Note,\nhowever, that ˆE determines Fl( ˆF , Σ) through the definition\nof ˆF in (5). ΛF,22 thus implicitly depends on ˆE. We will\nnot consider this implicit dependency in the remainder of this\npaper and treat ΛF,22 as a independent error source.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nMotivated by Figure 6, we obtain a characterization of\nΛC that allows us to isolate the influence of abstraction\nand reduction errors on the error ΛC on the reduced-order\ninterconnected system.\nTheorem 1.

A third abstracted reduction algorithm could be\nformulated based on Theorem 4, using frequency-dependent\nbounds as in (33). However, as this algorithm would be nearly\nequivalent to Algorithm 2, it is omitted for brevity.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nC. Computational considerations and tuning parameters\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe main drawback of the systematic approach of Algo-\nrithm 2 is the increase of computational cost with respect to\nstandard abstracted reduction as in Algorithm 1. The additional\ncost, however, heavily depends on the system under consid-\neration. The computational cost of the optimization problems\nas presented in Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, scales with the\nnumber of inputs and outputs of the nominal model N (s)\n[27]. Therefore,\nthe robust approach is best applicable to\nsystems where the number of inputs and outputs, m and p, are\nsmall (e.g., less than 10). Furthermore, in the frequency-based\napproach, optimization is typically conducted for a discrete\nfrequency grid ω ∈ . To expedite this process, parallel com-\nputation can be employed, simultaneously addressing multiple\nfrequency points.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nBesides the additional computational cost of optimization in\nstep 1) of Algorithm 2, the robust approach also complicates\nthe reduction of E and Fl( ˆF , Σ) in step 2) and 4). Namely, the\nmodels should be reduced as much as possible, while satisfy-\ning ΛE,22 ∈ E,22 and ˜ΛF ∈ ˜\nF , which typically results in\nan iterative procedure. In case of standard, projection-based\nreduction methods, this too can be implemented efficiently\nby iteratively increasing the order of the projection matrix.\nTo check efficiently whether ΛE,22 ∈ E,22 and ˜ΛF ∈ ˜\nF\nat each iteration, the H∞-norm can be calculated using the\ninstead, frequency-based bounds are\napproach of [30]. If,\n ˆF (iω), Σ(iω) can\nused, as in Theorem 4, E22(iω) and Fl\nbe determined beforehand, such that ΛE,22(iω) and ˜ΛF (iω)\ncan be determined rapidly by only calculating ˆE22(iω) and\nFl( ˆF (iω), ˆΣ(iω). Particular reduction methods also permit a\npriori lower or upper error bounds [31, 32], which may be\nused to select an initial rE, rΣ for faster convergence.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn Algorithm 2, β, Gy and Gu are tuning parameters to\nbe supplied by the user. Although any selection of these\nparameters guarantees ΛC to be in C, they greatly influence\nthe resulting reduced-order model ˆΣ(s) and the required com-\nputational cost. Their specific influence is discussed below:\nOptimization parameter β\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.5**\nF at the cost of a smaller set size of\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nParameter β is used to choose how to allocate the total\nF in the\nC between\nallowed reduction error\noptimization of Theorem 4. A larger β therefore increases the\nset size of ˜\nE,22,\nsuch that Σ(s) can be reduced further and E(s) can be\nreduced less. Vice versa, a smaller β allows more reduction\nof E(s) and lesser reduction of Σ(s). Thus, β gives a trade-\noff between the computational cost of the structure-preserving\nreduction (smaller ˆE(s) reduces cost) and the amount of\neffective reduction of Σ(s).\nRemark 7. While β allows the user to increase the size of ˜\nF ,\nthere exists an upper bound to ˜\nF for which E,22 is an empty\nset, i.e., ΛE,22 = O. At this point, the reduction converts\nto the expensive structure-preserving reduction of Fl(E, Σ),\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\nE,22 however, ˜\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhich we aim to avoid with abstracted reduction (see also\nSection IV-A). For a sufficiently small\nF\napproximates this upper bound and further increasing β does\nnot allow further reduction of ˆΣ(s). This value of β is in\nsome sense optimal, as ˆΣ(s) is reduced as far as possible\nusing Algorithm 2, and further increasing β only results in an\nincreased order of ˆE(s) and thus in an increased computational\ncost of the reduction. This value is however only attainable\nthrough iterative evaluation of the resulting rΣ and rE for\nvariable β, which is very costly itself.\nAugmented weighting Gu and Gy\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWeighting matrices Gu and Gy scale the magnitude of\nthe augmented outputs. Intuitively, increasing their magnitude\ntherefore increases the importance of the augmented outputs,\ni.e., the 22-partition of Fl( ˆF , Σ) as in (10), with respect to\nthe external inputs and outputs of Fl( ˆE, Σ). Large Gu and\nGy would therefore improve the approximation Fl( ˆF , Σ)22,\nsuch that fewer states are required to achieve ˜ΛF ∈ ˜\nF ,\nwhereas small Gu and Gy would improve the approximation\nFl( ˆF , Σ)11 = Fl(E, Σ). Thus, the magnitudes of Gu and\nGy give a trade-off between accuracy of Fl(E, ˆΣ) and the\namount of reduction. This means that for smaller Gu and\nGy, ΛC becomes smaller, i.e., the reduction becomes more\nconservative with respect to the specified\nC, because 1)\nthere is more focus on the accuracy of Fl( ˆE, Σ) compared\nto Fl( ˆF , Σ)22 and 2) rΣ is increased.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn addition to the simple scaling of magnitudes, Gu and Gy\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncan also be related to VF (s) and WF (s), for instance, as\nGu,ij = α (∥VF,ij∥2)−2 , Gy,ij = α (∥WF,ij∥2)−2 ,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nwhere (.)ij denotes the i,j’th element of the transfer matrix,\nα is a scalar R>0 and ∥(.)∥2 denotes the H2-norm.

Additional frequency dependencies\ncan also be reflected by augmentation with transfer matrices\nGu(s) and Gy(s), which should be bistable and biproper to\nallow Lemma 2.

To this end,\nwe first formulate an environment model Ej, for each j ∈\n{1, . . . , 5}, as the interconnection of all remaining subsystems\nΣl, l ∈ {1, . . . , 5}\\{j}, and then perform Algorithm 1 once\nfor each subsystem Σj.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTo properly evaluate the reduction of all Σj in the abstracted\nreduction framework, three balanced reduction methods are\nused: subsystem balanced reduction (ssBR), without taking\nthe environment into account (see Figure 2a and [22]), in-\nterconnected systems balanced reduction (ISBR), taking its\nfull environment into account (see Figure 2b and [9]), and\nabstracted reduction using CLBR (aCLBR), taking only an\nabstraction of the environment into account (see Figure 2c,\nAlgorithm 1 and [19]). The three resulting reduction methods\nare then compared in terms of computational cost and the\naccuracy of the resulting reduced-order, interconnected model.\nThe ISBR approach, as introduced by Vandendorpe and Van\nDooren [9], is a generalization of CLBR. Whereas CLBR is\nonly defined for 2 interconnected subsystems, ISBR reduces\nall k ≥ 2 subsystems to retain their relevance with respect to\nthe interconnected system.

As explained in Section V-C, β influences the\nC(ω). Specifically, a\ndistribution of the total error budget\nlarge β increases the bound εF (ω) at the cost of a smaller\nbound εE(ω). For β → ∞, only εF (ω) is maximized,\nregardless of εE(ω), i.e., εF (ω) is the bound on ˜ΛF (ω) if\nthe full E(s) is considered instead of ˆE(s). For β = 0, the\nopposite occurs, and εE(ω) is maximized, regardless of εF (ω).\nHowever, the latter optimization problem is ill-posed as the\nF , because\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nE,22 is theoretically unbounded for an empty set ˜\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nfor ˜ΛF = O, ˆΣ(s) = Σ(s) regardless of ˆE(s).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nNaturally, a larger allowed error bound can be satisfied more\neasily by a reduced model, so that the model’s order can be\ndecreased further. Therefore, varying β also allows a trade-\noff between rΣ and rE. Assuming Gy = Ip, Gu = Im,\nwe can visualize this trade-off in Figure 12b. Note that we\nwant to reduce Σ(s) as far as possible, i.e, nΣ − rΣ should\nbe large, while nE − rE should only be sufficiently small\nto reduce the computational complexity of the reduction ap-\nproach.

To evaluate the influ-\nence of these weighting matrices, we determine the maximum\norder reduction with weighting Gy = αIp, Gu = αIm for\nα = 0.01, 1, and 100, as visualized in Figure 13. As explained\nin Section V-C, a high value α favors the accuracy of the\naugmented outputs, such that, for a large α, ˜ΛF (s) would\nbe relatively small, whereas ΛC(s) would be relatively large.\nThis implies that for a given rE, a smaller rΣ would be\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nand rΣ = 63 (nE = 1756, nΣ = 380). The FRFs of ˆE22\nand Fl( ˆF , ˆΣ)22 and their errors are visualized by red dashed\nlines in Figure 11b and Figure 11c, respectively, which are,\nby definition, fully included in the blue area.

The full execution of the robust abstracted re-\nduction framework of Algorithm 2 using these settings takes\napproximately 450 s, of which most time is required to solve\nthe optimization problem of Theorem 4. The computation time\ndepends on the number of inputs and outputs of Σ (which\ndetermine the dimensions of N ) and the efficiency of the\nused numerical method. Currently, V −2(iω), W −2(iω) and\nDℓ, Dr are solved iteratively using MOSEK [35]. However,\nthere exist much more efficient methods to calculate bounds\non µ∆(V N W ) (as used in Theorem 3) [36]. Incorporating\nsuch methods could potentially speed up the determination\nof E,22 and ˜\nF significantly. This is, however, outside the\nscope of this paper and is left for further research.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe robust abstracted reduction framework allocates an\nerror budget, εE(ω), to the reduction of E and, εF (ω), to\nthe reduction of Σ. To reduce E and Σ as far as possible,\nwe should aim to use as much of these budgets as pos-\nsible. However, the chosen reduction methods do not take\nthese error budgets into account, resulting in considerable\nconservatism. This is especially apparent for the abstraction,\nwhere ∥ΛE,22(iω)∥ ≪ εE(ω) for most frequencies, as shown\nin Figure 11b. In addition, even when ∥ΛE,22(iω)∥ ≈ εE(ω),\nusually only one input-output pair restricts further reduction,\nwhile other input-output pairs are well within specification.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nThese two sources of conservatism result\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nin significant\nconservatism of the eventual reduced, interconnected model\nFl(E, ˆΣ), as shown by difference of a factor 100 between\nactual error and allowed error. In addition, the reduced orders\nof rE = 184 and rΣ = 63 remain quite large. Through iterative\nreduction and evaluation of ΛC(s), a process that is far from\nC(ω),\nstraightforward, we found that the specification of\nwith εC(ω) = 10−7, for all ω ∈ , is achievable by aCLBR\nwith rE = 20 and rΣ = 8 and by ssBR with rΣ = 22.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nSummarizing,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nthe above analysis gives insight\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ninto the\nsensitivity of the resulting error ΛC(s) to inaccuracies of the\nenvironment model.

However, the results\nshown in Figure 13 are not consistent with this, as a larger α\noften allows less reduction of Σ(s), given a certain given rE.\nIn addition, we observe a rather nonlinear relation between\nerror bounds and reduction order, which makes it difficult to\nset proper α and β that result in the maximum reduction of\nE(s) and Σ(s). This inconsistency between the theory and\nthe results of Figure 13 is attributed to the presented use\ncase (where the dynamics of Σ relevant to the input-output\nbehaviour of Σ and Fl(E, Σ) seems to align) and the non-\noptimality of CLBR (or weighted CLBR [8]).

CONCLUSION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe have introduced the framework of abstracted reduction\nto improve the tractability of the structure-preserving reduction\nof interconnected systems. In this framework, the structure-\npreserving reduction method is not applied to the full inter-\nconnected system model, but to a single subsystem model con-\nnected to a low-order abstraction of its environment. By thus\napplying structure-preserving reduction to a much lower-order\nmodel, the computational cost of this reduction is significantly\nreduced. Leveraging techniques from robust performance, we\nintroduced a second approach to also automatically determine\n(environment) abstraction and (subsystem) reduction orders\nthat guarantee the reduced interconnected system model to be\nstable and to satisfy a prescribed H∞-accuracy specification.\nBy means of a high-dimensional model representing an\ninterconnected lithography machine frame, we have illustrated\nthat employing a structure-preserving reduction method within\nthe abstracted reduction framework can significantly decrease\nthe reduction’s computational cost without significant loss of\naccuracy. Although the robust performance-based approach\ntends to yield a conservative reduced-order model of the inter-\nconnected system, it effectively illustrates the relation between\nthe introduced error budgets. It is important to emphasize that\nthe introduced abstracted reduction framework is versatile,\ni.e., it is compatible with any structure-preserving reduction\nmethod. This versatility suggests the potential for numerous al-\nternative implementations that offer enhanced accuracy, greater\norder reduction, and less conservatism compared to the current\nimplementation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nVIII.

         " Abstracted Model Reduction: A General Framework for Efficient Interconnected System Reduction   Luuk Poort, Lars A.L. Janssen, Bart Besselink, Rob H.B. Fey, Nathan van de Wouw   Complex dynamical systems are often composed of in- terconnected subsystems, such as plant-controller feedback loops, multi-physical systems, networked cyber-physical sys- tems, or assemblies of components in high-tech equipment. The collective of all subsystem models constitutes the model of the interconnected system, as schematically visualized in Figure 1a. Often, this interconnected system model is of such high order that dynamical analysis becomes computationally infeasible and model order reduction methods are required to approximate the high-order model by a low-order surrogate model. An illustrative scenario where this problem arises can be found in structural dynamics, such as in the design and   analysis of lithography machines [1], which serves as the primary motivating case study for this research.   When reducing a model of interconnected subsystems, it is preferable to retain the interconnection structure to keep the modelling approach modular. In other words, the reduced interconnected system model should be constructed from re- duced subsystem models. This modular reduction approach aligns with the typical design process in industry, where each subsystem is largely developed separately [2]. The combi- nation of such modular design and model reduction allows for greater flexibility of individual design teams, preservation of the essential structure of the interconnected system and increased interpretability of the reduced system model.   The most direct and resource-efficient approach to modu- lar reduction involves individually reducing each subsystem model [3], i.e., in an “open-loop” sense, for which many standard reduction methods exist [4–6]. This approach is particularly practical because the computational cost of model reduction scales with the model order and the individual subsystem models are clearly of lower order than the intercon- nected model as a whole. Even though one has to reduce mul- tiple lower-order subsystem models, this is usually still much cheaper than the reduction of one high-order interconnected system model. However, individual reduction of the separate subsystem models might not retain the dynamics required for the reduced, interconnected system model to accurately approximate its full-order model counterpart [3, 7].   To improve the accuracy of the reduced interconnected sys- tem model, a variety of methods [8–14] have been developed to reduce the interconnected system model while preserving its interconnection structure. These methods effectively reduce the individual subsystem models in a “closed-loop” sense by considering the interconnected dynamics. Consequently, such structure-preserving reduction methods successfully reduce the subsystem models to lower-order models that collectively constitute a low-order, interconnected model that accurately approximates the original, high-order model.   Unfortunately, for many complex engineering systems the interconnected system model is of such a high order, that many structure-preserving reduction methods become computation- ally infeasible. In such cases, only computationally highly efficient reduction methods remain viable.   iterative methods. For instance,   One approach to address these computational constraints in is to use approximate, [15], the Gramians of the interconnected system model are approximated to reduce each subsystem model. However, as available structure-preserving reduction methods evaluate the interconnected model differently, i.e., not all use Gramians [3, 13, 14], there is no single iterative method that provides a   To address this challenge, we introduce the framework of abstracted model reduction, illustrated in Figure 2c, as our first main contribution. The core idea is to use a low- order abstraction of the environment model, rather than the original, high-order environment model, to identify the sys- tem dynamics most relevant to the interconnected system. The framework serves as a versatile solution to improve the efficiency of structure-preserving reduction methods for interconnected systems.   As a second contribution, we employ techniques from robust performance theory, which have recently been applied in the context of reducing interconnected systems [17], to quanti- tatively assess how relying solely on an abstraction of the environment influences the resulting accuracy of the reduced interconnected system model. This allows us to establish a priori requirements on the accuracy of both the abstracted environment model and the reduced system model, based on user-defined, frequency-dependent or H∞-based specifications on the model accuracy of the interconnected system as a whole. These specifications are then leveraged to extend the framework of abstracted model reduction (abstracted reduction for brevity) to the framework of robust abstracted reduction. This latter framework automatically generates a reduced-order system model which guarantees stability of the reduced inter- connected system model and guarantees the satisfaction of its prescribed accuracy specification.   Finally, we evaluate the abstracted model reduction frame- work by an industrial case study, where we reduce a structural dynamics model of lithography equipment of the semiconduc- tor industry, consisting of several interconnected subsystem models. Through application of abstracted model reduction in combination with closed-loop balanced reduction [18, 19], we show that a low-order abstraction of a subsystem’s environ- ment is sufficient to ensure the relevance of the reduced sub- system model and the accuracy of the reduced interconnected system model.   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system-environment representation is presented and the problem is formally defined. Then, the framework of abstracted reduction is introduced in Section III. In this frame- work, an error source is introduced both for the abstraction of the environment and for the reduction of the subsystem. In Section IV, we relate both error sources to the resulting error on the level of the interconnected system and use robust per- formance techniques to relate the different error specifications. This relation is subsequently leveraged to present a systematic approach to abstracted reduction in Section V. Subsequently, in Section VI, both the general abstracted reduction framework and its robust extension are evaluated and compared to other reduction approaches from literature by means of an industrial case study. Finally, Section VII presents conclusions on the proposed approach.   Notation: In this paper, sets are generally indicated by blackboard-bold symbols, such as R, R>0 and C, which denote the set of real, positive real and complex numbers, respectively. Rm×p and Cm×p indicate matrices of real and complex numbers, respectively, with m rows and p columns. Given a complex matrix A, A⊤ and AH denote its transpose and   universally applicable solution to computational limitations. In addition, it is often unclear how the use of such approximate solutions impacts the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order interconnected system model.   Alternatively, in case of sparsely interconnected systems, Leung et al. [16] perform the structure-preserving reduction of a subsystem using only information on its immediate neighbors. As a result, the reduced subsystem model is relevant with respect to the considered cluster of subsystem models. For each subsystem, its immediate neighbouring subsystems there- fore act as a lower-order surrogate for its full environment, consisting of all other subsystem models. By iterating over all subsystems, all reduced subsystem model retain their relevance with respect to their own clusters, theoretically resulting in a (more) accurate reduced, interconnected model.   In this paper, we introduce a novel, different perspective. Let us focus on a single subsystem, which we then denote as the system, which is embedded within an environment consisting of the remaining subsystems, as visualized schematically in Figure 1. A model for this environment is straightforwardly attained by the interconnection of all remaining subsystem models. Using this general system-environment model descrip- tion, including any system within a dynamic environment, we can schematically visualize the open-loop and closed- loop reduction methods by Figures 2a and 2b, respectively. Observing the structure-preserving reduction as in Figure 2b, the environment determines what essential system dynamics to retain (in the light of the interconnected system dynamics). However, this model for the environment is often unnecessarily complex (high order), thereby inducing computation infeasi- bility.   In the setting of interconnected systems, E(s) typically rep- resents several (interconnected) subsystems such that its order is typically large, particularly nE > nΣ. This motivates the current work, where the evaluation of Σ(s) is computationally tractable, but the evaluation of Fl(E, Σ) is not.   B. Structure-preserving model reduction   The high-level objective is to find a transfer function matrix ˆΣ(s) of order rΣ < nΣ such that Fl(E, ˆΣ), as depicted in Figure 3b, is well-posed, stable and accurately approximates Fl(E, Σ) in terms of input-output behaviour, i.e., such that the approximation error, being the output of the error dynamics: ΛC := Fl(E, ˆΣ) − Fl(E, Σ), is small in a suitable sense. Structure-preserving reduction methods as discussed in [7, 9, 10, 21] aim to find an accurate reduced-order model Fl(E, ˆΣ). However, they are often only applicable to interconnected systems of limited order. In addition, most methods either do not guarantee stability of Fl(E, ˆΣ), e.g. [7, 9], or require additional system properties such as passivity [10, 21].   A further, intrinsic limitation of structure-preserving reduc- tion methods is the need for environment model E(s). In a modular, model-based design process of complex engineering systems, where subsystems are designed in parallel, the envi- ronment model E(s) is typically not available or only a rough estimate ˆE(s) is available.   C. Problem statement   Our goal is to address the limitations of existing structure- preserving model reduction methods. Particularly, given a system Σ(s) and environment E(s), possibly both of large order, we aim to reduce Σ(s) to ˆΣ(s) such that   1) stability is preserved, i.e., Fl(E, ˆΣ) is well-posed, inter-   nally stable, and Fl(E, ˆΣ) ∈ RH∞,   2) the approximation is accurate in the sense that the ap- proximation error dynamics ΛC := Fl(E, ˆΣ)−Fl(E, Σ) is small.   Specifically, we consider the case where the order of E(s) is high, such that the application of existing structure-preserving reduction methods to Fl(E, Σ) is not feasible (or comes at too large computational cost).   We will initially neglect giving guarantees on the accuracy and stability of the reduced model (such guarantees will be treated in Sections IV-B and V) and focus on addressing the computational limitations of structure-preserving reduction methods. To this end, we propose the abstracted reduction framework in Section III-A. The computational benefits of this approach and some applicability considerations are sub- sequently discussed in Section III-B.   A. The abstracted reduction algorithm   To facilitate efficient and accurate model reduction, we present our framework of abstracted reduction, which is also illustrated in Figure 4, consisting of the following steps.   conjugate transpose, respectively, ∥A∥ denotes its 2-induced norm, A ≻ 0 and A ⪰ 0 denote that A is positive definite and positive semi-definite, respectively, and A = diag(A1, A2) denotes a block-diagonal matrix of submatrices A1 and A2. The zero matrix and identity matrix are denoted by O and I, respectively, while In denotes an identity matrix of size n. Given a transfer function matrix Σ(s), where s is the Laplace variable, ∥Σ∥∞ denotes its H∞-norm. The set of all proper, real rational stable transfer matrices is denoted by RH∞.   The system and its environment, as schematically visualized in Figure 1b, are modeled by the proper, real rational transfer function matrices Σ(s) and E(s), respectively, such that the interconnected system model can be described by the block- diagram shown in Figure 3a. The system model Σ(s) has inputs u ∈ Rm, outputs y ∈ Rp and McMillan degree (order) nΣ and the environment model E(s) has inputs w ∈ RmC and y ∈ Rp, outputs z ∈ RpC and u ∈ Rm and order nE, such that E11 E12 E21 E22   The system and environment are interconnected by means of a lower linear fractional transformation (LFT), as defined below.  P11(s) P12(s) P21(s) P22(s)    Definition 1. Let P (s) = , Ml(s) and Mu(s) be proper, real rational transfer function matrices of dimensions (p1 + p2) × (m1 + m2), m2 × p2 and m1 × p1, respectively. Then, we define the lower and upper LFTs, respectively, as   Fl(P, Ml) = P12Ml(I − P22Ml)−1P21 + P11, Fu(P, Mu) = P21Mu(I − P11Mu)−1P12 + P22,   which are said to be well-posed if I − P22Ml and I − P11Mu have a proper real rational inverse, respectively [20, Def. 9.2, Lem. 5.1].   Using this definition, the interconnection of system Σ and environment E as in Figure 3a can be written as Fl(E, Σ). We make the following assumption to ensure that Fl(E, Σ) is well-defined and internally stable (see [20, Chapter 5]). Assumption 1. We have Σ(s) ∈ RH∞, E(s) ∈ RH∞ and the interconnection Fl(E, Σ) is well-posed and internally stable, i.e., Σ(I − E22Σ)−1 ∈ RH∞. Particularly, we have Fl(E, Σ) ∈ RH∞.   reduction methods to evaluate the approximate, coupled input- output behaviour (via Fl( ˆF , Σ)), thereby significantly reduc- ing computational costs. In an ideal world, without compu- tational limitations, one would like to do direct, structure- preserving reduction of Fl(E, Σ). However, this is not always feasible or it is computationally very expensive. Hence, we suggest abstracted reduction as a framework to enable an approximate structure-preserving reduction, where the direct structure-preserving reduction of Fl(E, Σ) is not feasible or too computationally expensive.   The augmentation with the weighting matrices Gu and Gy in Algorithm 1 serves two main purposes: (i) to control the accuracy distribution over ˆΣ and Fl(E, ˆΣ), and (ii) to facilitate error analysis in Section IV. Regarding the first purpose, increasing the magnitudes of Gu and Gy amplifies the contribution of Σ’s input-output behaviour in Fl( ˆF , Σ). When using an input-output approximating reduction method, high-magnitude Gu and Gy thus improve ˆΣ’s approximation of Σ at the cost of the accuracy of Fl( ˆF , ˆΣ). This trade-off is discussed further in Section V-C. Regarding the second- purpose, it turns out that extending the number inputs and outputs Fl( ˆE, Σ) to Fl( ˆF , Σ), by augmentation of ˆE(s) to ˆF (s), is often essential for deriving the error relations in the abstracted reduction algorithm, as detailed in Section IV.   B. Computational benefits and applicability   To compare the computational cost of abstracted reduction to direct structure-preserving reduction of Fl(E, Σ), recall that the model orders of E(s), ˆE(s), Σ(s) and ˆΣ(s) are denoted as nE, rE, nΣ and rΣ, respectively. Structure-preserving reduc- tion methods based on balancing, such as [9, 10], usually scale cubically with the order of Fl(E, Σ) [23], while structure- preserving methods based on LMI’s, such as [14, 24], scale even more steeply. Hence, our abstracted approach replaces a cost (nE + nΣ)c with (rE + nΣ)c for c ≥ 3, i.e., the en- vironment is replaced by a low-order abstraction, which yields a significant reduction in computational cost when nE is large and rE is small, and when nE is large compared to nΣ.   The low-order abstraction ˆE can be obtained by an inexpen- sive reduction method, which does not preserve structure, such as [25, 26], as its accuracy is not so important for the accuracy of the reduced, interconnected system Fl(E, ˆΣ); it merely acts as a weight in the reduction of Σ to ˆΣ. In such a case, the computational cost of the reduction of Σ to ˆΣ is dominant. This makes abstracted reduction mostly beneficial to systems where nE > nΣ and when rE is selected as rE ≪ nE, as shown in Figure 5. Remark 1. Sometimes, Σ(s) needs to be reduced while having incomplete knowledge of E(s). This is a common occurrence in modular design processes, where several subsystems are designed simultaneously. However, these design processes are typically iterative, such that we generally possess subsystem models from a previous iteration. In our abstracted approach, we suggest to use ˆE(s), an approximation of E(s), to ef- fectively indicate which dynamics of Σ(s) are relevant to Fl(E, Σ). Therefore, an ˆE(s) of a previous design iteration or even an ˆE(s) based on a basic, preliminary environment   Algorithm 1. Abstracted reduction Input: p × m transfer matrix Σ(s) and (pC + m) × (mC + p) transfer matrix E(s), of orders nΣ, nE, respectively, abstrac- tion order rE ≤ nE and reduction order rΣ < nΣ and weighting matrices Gy ∈ Cp×p and Gu ∈ Cm×m. Output: Surrogate model ˆΣ(s) of reduced order rΣ, such that Fl(E, ˆΣ) approximates Fl(E, Σ).   1) Abstraction of E(s). Abstract E(s) to ˆE(s) in open loop, i.e., disconnected from Σ(s), by means of, e.g., reduction or another form of surrogate modelling. 2) Augmentation of ˆE(s). Augment the set of external inputs and outputs of Fl( ˆE, Σ) by incorporating Σ’s (weighted) inputs u and outputs y. This is equivalent to replacing ˆE(s) with ˆF (s), resulting in Fl( ˆF , Σ), where    ˆE12 O Gy ˆE22 where ˆE is partitioned the same as E, see (1).   3) Reduction of Σ(s). Use a structure-preserving reduction   method to reduce Fl( ˆF , Σ) to Fl( ˆF , ˆΣ).   4) Substitution of E(s). Substitute the original environ-   ment E(s) to obtain Fl(E, ˆΣ).   To interpret the concept of abstracted reduction, let us first disregard the augmentation step by selecting Gu(s) = Om×m, Gy(s) = Op×p and assume the use of reduction methods that approximate a model’s input-output behaviour, such as balancing methods [19, 22]. Then, abstracted reduction can be interpreted as follows: whereas an open-loop reduction approach evaluates the input-output behaviour of the sys- tem (Σ) itself and structure-preserving reduction approach evaluates the coupled input-output behaviour (of Fl(E, Σ)), the abstracted reduction approach uses structure-preserving   We emphasize that we work with the error system ΛF (s) rather than with ˆΣ(s) − Σ(s), for the following two reasons:   • Structure-preserving reduction methods reduce subsys- tems based on the coupled dynamics, such that any available error bounds are typically bounds on ΛF (s). • As we aim to (accurately) approximate the coupled dynamics, the magnitude of ˆΣ − Σ cannot be expected to be a good indication of the quality of reduction. Alterna- tively, ΛF typically gives a much better indication of the quality of the overall reduction, as long as ΛE is small. Note that if ΛE = 0, Gu = Om×m and Gy = Op×p, indeed ΛF = Fl(E, ˆΣ) − Fl(E, Σ). Therefore, if a specification on the accuracy of Fl(E, ˆΣ) is translated to bounds on ΛE and ΛF , these bounds are expected to be less conservative than similar bounds on ˆΣ − Σ. The abstraction and reduction steps, characterized through the errors in (6) and (7), respectively, ultimately lead to the reduction error ΛC of the interconnected system, as previously introduced in (4) and repeated here for completeness as   E(s), ˆΣ(s) − Fl   Our main goal in this section is to relate ΛC to the error systems ΛE and ΛF . As a first step in this direction, we express the reduced-order system ˆΣ in terms of the reduction error system ΛF . Lemma 2. Let Σ(s), ˆΣ(s) be transfer function matrices and let ˆF (s) be as in (5) with square, invertible matrices Gu and Gy, such that Fl( ˆF , Σ) and Fl( ˆF , ˆΣ) are well-posed with a difference ΛF (s) as in (7). Then   , Σ(I − ˆE22Σ)−1 + G−1   is the 22-partition of ΛF as in (7), representing the transfer matrix from the augmented inputs to the augmented outputs of Fl( ˆF , Σ).   Proof. Let us first define P := can be rewritten as   and note that (10)   P, ˆΣ = GyΣ(I − ˆE22Σ)−1Gu + ΛF,22.   Given the fact that Gu and Gy are square and invertible, we can then use the inversion formula of [28, Lemma 10.4] to extract ˆΣ from Fl(P, ˆΣ) as    A substitution of (11) and (13) into (12) gives an expression similar to (9). Using the definition of the upper LFT in (3), we P, ˆΣ finally move the G−1 u to attain the expression for ˆΣ as in (9).   terms from P −1 to Fl   model might improve the accuracy of Fl(E, ˆΣ) beyond what can be achieved through (open-loop) reduction of Σ. However, in case a preliminary model ˆE is used without knowledge of its accuracy (i.e., without knowing E), the formal error analysis of Section IV can not be applied.   IV. ERROR ANALYSIS AND THE RELATION OF BOUNDS The reduction goal, as specified in Section II, is to achieve a low-order surrogate model ˆΣ(s) such that the reduced, interconnected model Fl(E, ˆΣ) is well-posed, stable and (ac- curately) approximates Fl(E, Σ). To this end, we first assume the reduction/abstraction errors to be known transfer functions and determine the relation between introduced reduction and abstraction errors and the error of the interconnected system in Section IV-A. Subsequently, building on the approach introduced in [27], we relate bounds on these errors in Sec- tion IV-B.   A. Error relations   We start by defining the errors introduced by the abstracted reduction procedure described by Algorithm 1 in Section III-A. First, the abstraction of the environment E(s) to its low-order approximation ˆE(s) leads to the error system   ΛE(s) := ˆE(s) − E(s). We recall from step 2 of Algorithm 1 that the resulting system Fl( ˆE, Σ) is subsequently augmented to obtain the system Fl( ˆF , Σ). Augmentation does not affect the well-posedness and stability of the interconnection, as stated next. Lemma 1. Consider the p × m transfer matrix Σ(s) and (pC +m)×(mC +p) transfer matrix ˆE(s), such that Fl( ˆE, Σ) is well-posed and internally stable. Then, for any ˆF (s) in (5), with weighting matrices Gy ∈ Cp×p and Gu ∈ Cm×m, Fl( ˆF , Σ) is well-posed and internally stable. Proof. Following Definition 1 and [20, Corollary 5.2], Fl( ˆF , Σ) is well-posed and internally stable if I − ˆE22Σ has a proper real rational inverse and Σ(I − ˆE22Σ)−1 ∈ RH∞, respectively. Both notions follow directly from the well- posedness and internal stability of Fl( ˆE, Σ). ■   the application of structure-preserving reduction methods to Fl( ˆF , Σ) (reduction step at the bottom of Figure 4) leads to a reduced-order system ˆΣ and error system  ˆF (s), Σ(s).   Remark 2. The inversion formula of [28, Lemma 10.4] used in the proof of Lemma 2 motivates the augmentation of E with Gu and Gy. Note, however, that we used only the augmented inputs and outputs to express ˆΣ. This augmentation is excessive as we can also express ˆΣ in terms of ΛF instead of ΛF,22. When using ΛF , P = ˆF in the proof, and the inversion requires ˆF21 and ˆF12 to be full column and row rank, respectively. In this general case, ˆΣ can be expressed by (9), with G−1 21, where (.)† denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. Augmentation of E with square and invertible Gu and Gy, however, gives the most convenient expression for ˆΣ, because this prevents the inversion of (unknown) transfer function matrices ˆF21 and ˆF12. Using the lower LFT definition in (2), the expression for the total reduction error system ΛC, as in (8), can be rewritten to  ˆΣ(I − E22 ˆΣ)−1 − Σ(I − E22Σ)−1   replaced by ˆF †   Substitution of ˆΣ(s) as in (9) gives an expression of ΛC in terms of the error system ΛF,22, as depicted schematically in Figure 6, where the expression for ˆΣ(s) is highlighted. This block diagram facilitates an intuitive interpretation. Firstly, if ΛF,22 = 0, the two feedback-loops with ˆE(s) cancel and ˆΣ(s) = Σ(s). This represents the inverse relation between the abstraction and substitution steps of the abstracted reduction if ˆE22(s) = E22(s), approach. Also, the feedback-loops indicated by a ∗ in Figure 6 cancel and the approach simplifies to standard structure-preserving reduction.   The observed dependency of ΛC on ˆE22 in Figure 6 suggests that ˆE11, ˆE12 and ˆE21 do not influence ΛC. Note, however, that ˆE determines Fl( ˆF , Σ) through the definition of ˆF in (5). ΛF,22 thus implicitly depends on ˆE. We will not consider this implicit dependency in the remainder of this paper and treat ΛF,22 as a independent error source.   Motivated by Figure 6, we obtain a characterization of ΛC that allows us to isolate the influence of abstraction and reduction errors on the error ΛC on the reduced-order interconnected system. Theorem 1. Let Σ(s), ˆΣ(s) be transfer function matrices and let ˆF (s) be as in (5), satisfying Assumption 1. Let ΛC(s) and   ΛF,22(s) be as in (8) and (10), respectively, and let ΛE,22 := ˆE22 − E22 and ˜ΛF := G−1 y ΛF,22G−1 ΛC = Fu(N, diag(ΛE,22, ˜ΛF , ΛE,22))   M (s) = Σ(s)(I − E22(s)Σ(s))−1,   such that N (s) ∈ RH∞ due to Assumption 1. Proof. Substitution of ˆE22 = E22 + ΛE,22, ˜ΛF (s) G−1 gives   := and (9) into ΛC := Fl(E, ˆΣ) − Fl(E, Σ)   ΛC = −Fl(E, Σ) + Fl    ,  −E22−ΛE,22 I O I  Σ(I − (E22 + ΛE,22)Σ)−1 + ˜ΛF   To extract the error terms of ΛE,22 and ˜ΛF , we note that  , Σ = Σ(I − (E22 + ΛE,22)Σ)−1,   with M as in (17), such that (18) can be rewritten as   ΛC = −Fl(E, Σ) + Fl (E, Fu ([ K K   Finally, these nested LFT’s can be expressed as the LFT of ■ (15), making repeated use of [28, Lemma 10.3].   The expression of ΛC as in (15) can be verified intuitively by its graphical representation in Figure 7. Starting from Figure 6, which represents the definition of ΛC in (8), we express ˆE22 as a parallel connection of E22 and ΛE,22 and “pull out” the error terms ΛE,22 and ˜ΛF , resulting in Figure 7. This shows that, indeed, (15) expresses ΛC as in (8).   Furthermore, we introduce scaling matrices Dℓ and Dr, for any ∆ of the form (26)   which satisfy D1/2 [29, Theorem 3.8], by requiring (Dℓ, Dr) ∈ D, with    dF ∈ R>0, S ∈ C2×2, S = SH ≻ 0   We can then use the approach of [27] to formulate the following guarantee on the boundedness of ΛC(s). Theorem 2. Consider the transfer functions Σ(s), E(s) and Fl(E, Σ) satisfying Assumption 1 and error dynamics (15). Let W (s) and V (s) be bistable and biproper weighting F and functions as given in (26) and let the sets C be as given in (25). If there exist some scaling matrices   (Dℓ, Dr) ∈ D, with D as given in (27), such that   N (iω)DrN H (iω) ⪯ Dℓ ∀ ω ∈ R,   with N = V N W and N as in (16), then it follows that if ΛE,22 ∈ E,22 and ˜ΛF ∈ ˜ Fl(E, ˆΣ) is well-posed and internally stable and the coupled error dynamics satisfies   Proof. We first note that N ∈ RH∞ due to Assumption 1 and N ∈ RH∞ due to the weighting functions V, W ∈ RH∞. Then, according to [27, Theorem 3.2], for any ΛE,22, ˜ΛF ∈ RH∞ satisfying (29), the coupled error dynamics (15) are well-posed, internally stable and satisfies (30) if and only if   where µ denotes the structured singular value [29, Defini- tion 3.1]. Instead of µ , we use its upper bound   which can be tightened by optimizing over Dℓ and Dr [29]. requirement Theorem 3.5], ¯σ(D−1/2 ) < 1 can be equivalently stated as N (iω)DrN H (iω) ⪯ Dℓ. Therefore, (28) implies (31) and thus ΛC ∈ RH∞ satisfies (30). Due to the definition of ΛC in (8) and Assumption 1, this also guarantees the internal stability and well-posedness of Fl(E, ˆΣ). ■   Remark 3. The approach of µ-analysis, as exploited in Theo- rem 2, typically requires Dℓ, Dr to only satisfy D1/2 r ∆ = ∆D1/2 . However, we impose additional constraints on the ℓ positive definiteness and Hermitian form of Dℓ, Dr in (27). These restrictions simplify further computation, while they do not increase the conservatism of (32) [29].   B. A robust performance perspective   Next, we will use the formulation of the overall error dy- namics as in Theorem 1 (and Figure 7) to relate requirements on bounds on this error dynamics to the errors made in the underlying abstraction and (structure-preserving) reduction step. We will assume a prescribed, weighted bound on the error ΛC(s) and aim to translate this to bounds on ΛE,22(s) and ˜ΛF (s). Specifically, we prescribe weighting matrices VC(s) ∈ RH∞ and WC(s) ∈ RH∞ and formulate the requirement as   ∆C(s) = VC(s) ΛC(s) WC(s),   for some ∆C(s) ∈ RH∞ satisfying ∥∆C∥∞ ≤ 1.   The abstraction and reduction errors ΛE,22(s), ˜ΛF (s) are   expressed similarly as   ΛE,22(s) = WE(s) ∆E,22(s) VE(s), ˜ΛF (s) = WF (s) ˜∆F (s) VF (s), for bistable weighting matrices VE, WE, VF , WF ∈ RH∞, implying that V −1 E , V −1 F ∈ RH∞, and some ∆E,22, ˜∆F ∈ RH∞ satisfying   The requirements of (22) and (23) can be stated equivalently by restricting ΛE,22, ˜ΛF and ΛC to the sets of transfer functions E,22, ˜   F and C, respectively, given as E ∥∞ ≤ 1, E,22 := ΛE,22 E ΛE,22V −1  F := ˜ΛF ˜ ˜ΛF V −1  ∥W −1 F  C := ΛC  ∥VCΛCWC∥∞ < 1. We can now formulate the goal of this section explicitly as: given the sets E,22, ˜ F and C, determine whether the coupled error dynamics are guaranteed to satisfy ΛC ∈ C for any ΛE,22 ∈ E,22 and ˜ΛF ∈ ˜   To determine the relation between E,22, ˜   F and C, we will use tools from robust performance analysis. By combining expression (15) for the coupled error dynamics ΛC with (22) and (23), we attain the framework of robust performance theory, as visualized in Figure 8. Then, the uncertainties and weights are combined in the block-diagonal transfer functions   ∆(s) := diag(∆E,22(s), ˜∆F (s), ∆E,22(s), ∆C(s)), V (s) := diag(VE(s), VF (s), VE(s), VC(s)), W (s) := diag(WE(s), WF (s), WE(s), WC(s)).   Besides the relation of weighted H∞-norm set defini- tions, as in Theorem 2, similar methods from robust per- formance are also applicable to relate frequency-dependent error bounds. To this end, with slight abuse of notation, we formulate frequency-dependent error set definitions by restrict- ing ΛE,22(iω), ˜ΛF (iω) and ΛC(iω) to E,22(ω), ˜ F (ω) and   C(ω) at frequency point ω ∈ R, where  ΛE,22(iω)     abstraction and reduction errors. This result is subsequently used to formulate the robust abstracted reduction framework, to efficiently reduce Fl(E, Σ) to Fl(E, ˆΣ), such that Fl(E, ˆΣ) is well-posed and internally stable and ΛC ∈ C.   Additionally, we formulate a frequency-dependent variant of the above-mentioned optimization problem in Section V-B, using Corollary 1, which is more flexible, but provides no stability guarantees. We then conclude in Section V-C with some notes on the properties of the proposed methods.    WE(iω)−1  ˜ΛF (iω)     A. The robust abstracted reduction framework for stability and accuracy guarantees   C(ω) := ΛC(iω)     ∥VC(iω)ΛC(iω)WC(iω)∥ < 1.   Using the set definitions of (33), we formulate a guarantee similar to Theorem 2 on the boundedness of ΛC(iω) at a specific frequency point ω ∈ R. Corollary 1. Consider the transfer functions Σ(s) and E(s), such that Fl(E, Σ) is well-posed and stable. Let W (s) and V (s) be weighting functions as in (26). Let ω ∈ R and let the sets E,22(ω), ˜ F (ω) and C(ω) be given as in (33). If there exist (Dℓ, Dr) ∈ D, with D as given in (27), such that N (iω)DrN H (iω) ≤ Dℓ,   with N (iω) = V (iω)N (iω)W (iω) and N as in (16), then it follows that if   ΛE,22(iω) ∈ E,22(ω) and ˜ΛF (iω) ∈ ˜   the coupled error dynamics ΛC, evaluated at ω, satisfies   ΛC(iω) ∈ C(ω).   Proof. The proof closely follows [27, Theorem 3.4], consid- ering µ per frequency point, and is largely equivalent to ■ Theorem 2.   In this section, we will leverage the relation between the introduced errors, as determined in Section IV, to guide the abstraction of E and reduction of Σ. This allows us to guaran- tee that the resulting coupled error ΛC satisfies a user-defined, possibly frequency-dependent specification. Specifically, we will answer the question: How should ˆE(s) and ˆΣ(s) be selected, such that Fl(E, ˆΣ) is stable and meets a prescribed accuracy specification?   the perspective in which   E,22, To this end, we adopt ˜ F and C represent specifications on ΛE,22, ˜ΛF and ΛC, respectively. Explicitly, an error, such as ΛC, satisfies its specification, C, if ΛC ∈ C. Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 then allow us to relate such specifications. In particular, we C is given and we mean to find focus on the case where specifications E,22 and ˜ F that guarantee ΛC ∈ C.   First, in Section V-A, we formulate an optimization problem F , as in (25), are where determined as the least conservative specifications on the   C is given and   To guarantee the stability and accuracy of Fl(E, ˆΣ), cap- C, we will use Theorem 2 to provide suitable tured in specifications E,22 and ˜ F . This can be interpreted as a dis- tribution of the coupled error budget C over the abstraction error budget E,22 and the structure-preserving reduction error budget ˜ F . To maximize the reduction of E and Σ, we aim for lenient specifications (large error budgets) E,22 and ˜ F , as in (33). To this end, we prescribe the weighting matrices W (s), as in (26), and ¯V (s), defined as   ¯V (s) := diag( ¯VE(s), ¯VF (s), ¯VE(s), ¯VC(s)),   where ¯ε = diag(¯εEIp, ¯εF Im, ¯εEIp, Imc) and V is given in (26). Particularly, ¯εE, ¯εF ∈ R>0 represent H∞-bounds on the weighted errors as    E ΛE,22 ¯V −1 ∞ ≤ ¯εE, E  ˜ΛF ¯V −1 ∞ ≤ ¯εF F   there exist   to note that   and we aim to maximize ¯εE and ¯εF . Then, for a given W (s) and ¯V (s), E,22 and ˜ F are defined by W (s) and V (s) = ¯ε ¯V (s), as in (33). is important   infinitely many combinations of ¯εE and ¯εF that guarantee ΛC ∈ C. To select which unique combination is the “optimal” one, we introduce an additional scalar parameter β to weigh the relative importance of ˜ F over E,22. This results in the following optimization problem. Theorem 3. Consider the transfer functions Σ(s), E(s) and Fl(E, Σ) satisfying Assumption 1 and error dynamics (15). Let the requirements E,22, ˜ F and C be given as in (25) and let ¯V (s) and W (s) be prescribed bistable and biproper weighting functions as in (37) and (26), respectively. Consider now the optimization problem where β ∈ R>0 is a given tuning variable:   given ¯V (s), W (s)   maximize ¯ε2 subject to ¯ε2 N (iω)DrN H (iω) ⪯ Dℓ ∀ ω ∈ R,   where N = ¯V N W , N is given in (16) and D in (27).   If ¯εE, ¯εF is a feasible solution to (39), then for any ΛE,22 ∈   RH∞ and ˜ΛF ∈ RH∞ that satisfy   the reduced, interconnected system Fl(E, ˆΣ) ∈ RH∞ and the error system satisfies ΛC ∈ C.   Proof. The proof follows from Theorem 2, where only V (s) is replaced by ¯ε ¯V (s). Substitution of V = ¯ε ¯V into (28) gives ■ the constraint of (39).   Remark 4. The matrix inequality of the optimization problem in Theorem 3 is not linear in its unknowns, but can be solved efficiently by iteratively solving for ¯ε and Dr, as shown in [17].   The solution to the optimization problem of Theorem 3 de- termines the maximum weighted H∞-bounds ¯εE and ¯εF , that define E,22 and ˜ F . However, to make sure these accuracy specifications can be satisfied by significantly reduced models ˆE and ˆΣ, the weighting functions ¯V and W should reflect the expected trend of the error system’s frequency response. For example, if the reduction method for abstracting the envi- ronment is known to particularly approximate low-frequency dynamics, ¯VE and WE could be prescribed as low-pass filters to ensure a more uniform response of W −1 E . This results in a less conservative H∞-bound and a lower-order abstraction of E.   To systematically reduce an interconnected system, we present the robust abstracted reduction framework: an ex- tension of Algorithm 1 with the optimization problem of Theorem 3. Using this framework in combination with ap- propriate (structure-preserving) reduction methods, Fl(E, Σ) is efficiently reduced to Fl(E, ˆΣ), such that Fl(E, ˆΣ) is well- posed, internally stable and ΛC ∈ C (i.e., the reduced-order interconnected system satisfies a given error specification). Algorithm 2. Robust Abstracted Reduction Input: Transfer functions Σ(s), E(s) and Fl(E, Σ) satisfying Assumption 1, bistable and biproper ¯V and W as in (37) and (26), scalar β ∈ R≥0 and full-rank weighting matrices Gu ∈ Cm×m and Gy ∈ Cp×p. Output: Surrogate model ˆΣ(s) of reduced order rΣ, such that Fl(E, ˆΣ) is well-posed, internally stable and ΛC ∈ C.   1) Optimization Solve the optimization problem given in   Theorem 3 to attain specifications ˜   2) Abstraction of E.

Reduce Σ(s) to ˆΣ(s) of the lowest   order rΣ, such that ˜ΛF ∈ ˜    F , where   5) Substitution of E. Substitute the original environment   E to obtain Fl(E, ˆΣ).   B. Frequency-based robust abstracted reduction   Algorithm 2 fully addresses the problem statement of Section II-C by providing a systematic and efficient way to reduce Fl(E, Σ). However, the algorithm requires several inputs, among which the bistable weighting functions ¯V (s) and W (s). In Section V-A, we advise ¯V (s) and W (s) to   reflect the expected trend error system’s response, but this might be unknown or very irregular over the frequency range of interest. To avoid providing these weighting functions, we will formulate an alternative approach, based on Corollary 1, to relate the error specifications E,22(ω), ˜ F (ω) and C(ω), as in (33), for a specific discrete frequency grid ω ∈ .   To simplify computation, we restrict V (s) and W (s), eval- uated at ω, to satisfy V (iω) ∈ V and W (iω) ∈ W, with V and W given as   This results in the following optimization problem. Theorem 4. Consider the transfer functions Σ(s) and E(s), such that Fl(E, Σ) is well-posed and stable. Let N (s), D, V and W, as given in (16), (27), (42) and (43), respectively, and let the sets E,22(ω), ˜ F (ω) and C(ω) be given as in (33). Consider now the optimization problem at the frequency point ω ∈ R where VC(iω) and WC(iω) are prescribed weighting matrices and β ∈ R>0 is a given tuning variable:   given VC(iω), WC(iω)   minimize tr(XV V −2(iω)) + tr(XW W −2(iω))   subject to   W −2(iω)D−1 r N (iω)   V (iω) ∈ V, W (iω) ∈ W, (Dℓ, Dr) ∈ D, XW = diag(Im, βIp, Im, IpC ), XV = diag(Ip, βIm, Ip, ImC ). If V (iω), W (iω) is a feasible solution to (44), then for any F (ω), it is ensured   ΛE,22(iω) ∈ E,22(ω) and ˜ΛF (iω) ∈ ˜ that ΛC(iω) ∈ C(ω).   Proof. In [17, Theorem 1] the inequality of (44) is shown to be equivalent to (34) when V (iω) ∈ V and W (iω) ∈ W. The ■ rest of the proof follows directly from Corollary 1.   Remark 5. The matrix inequality of the optimization problem in Theorem 4 is not linear in its unknowns, but can be solved efficiently by iteratively solving for V −2(ω), W −2(ω) and Dℓ, Dr as shown in [17].   C(ω) for a specific frequency ω. In addition,   Compared to Theorem 3, which required the bistable trans- fer matrices ¯V (s) and W (s), Theorem 4 only needs to be supplied with the required coupled accuracy specification C(ω) can be selected more freely, as the weighting matrices V (iω) and W (iω) do not even need to represent actual transfer functions. However, this comes at the loss of any guarantees on well- posedness, stability or on an error bound for other frequency points.   Remark 6. A third abstracted reduction algorithm could be formulated based on Theorem 4, using frequency-dependent bounds as in (33). However, as this algorithm would be nearly equivalent to Algorithm 2, it is omitted for brevity.   C. Computational considerations and tuning parameters   The main drawback of the systematic approach of Algo- rithm 2 is the increase of computational cost with respect to standard abstracted reduction as in Algorithm 1. The additional cost, however, heavily depends on the system under consid- eration. The computational cost of the optimization problems as presented in Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, scales with the number of inputs and outputs of the nominal model N (s) [27]. Therefore, the robust approach is best applicable to systems where the number of inputs and outputs, m and p, are small (e.g., less than 10). Furthermore, in the frequency-based approach, optimization is typically conducted for a discrete frequency grid ω ∈ . To expedite this process, parallel com- putation can be employed, simultaneously addressing multiple frequency points.   Besides the additional computational cost of optimization in step 1) of Algorithm 2, the robust approach also complicates the reduction of E and Fl( ˆF , Σ) in step 2) and 4). Namely, the models should be reduced as much as possible, while satisfy- ing ΛE,22 ∈ E,22 and ˜ΛF ∈ ˜ F , which typically results in an iterative procedure. In case of standard, projection-based reduction methods, this too can be implemented efficiently by iteratively increasing the order of the projection matrix. To check efficiently whether ΛE,22 ∈ E,22 and ˜ΛF ∈ ˜ F at each iteration, the H∞-norm can be calculated using the instead, frequency-based bounds are approach of [30]. If,  ˆF (iω), Σ(iω) can used, as in Theorem 4, E22(iω) and Fl be determined beforehand, such that ΛE,22(iω) and ˜ΛF (iω) can be determined rapidly by only calculating ˆE22(iω) and Fl( ˆF (iω), ˆΣ(iω). Particular reduction methods also permit a priori lower or upper error bounds [31, 32], which may be used to select an initial rE, rΣ for faster convergence.   In Algorithm 2, β, Gy and Gu are tuning parameters to be supplied by the user. Although any selection of these parameters guarantees ΛC to be in C, they greatly influence the resulting reduced-order model ˆΣ(s) and the required com- putational cost. Their specific influence is discussed below: Optimization parameter β   F at the cost of a smaller set size of   Parameter β is used to choose how to allocate the total F in the C between allowed reduction error optimization of Theorem 4. A larger β therefore increases the set size of ˜ E,22, such that Σ(s) can be reduced further and E(s) can be reduced less. Vice versa, a smaller β allows more reduction of E(s) and lesser reduction of Σ(s). Thus, β gives a trade- off between the computational cost of the structure-preserving reduction (smaller ˆE(s) reduces cost) and the amount of effective reduction of Σ(s). Remark 7. While β allows the user to increase the size of ˜ F , there exists an upper bound to ˜ F for which E,22 is an empty set, i.e., ΛE,22 = O. At this point, the reduction converts to the expensive structure-preserving reduction of Fl(E, Σ),   E,22 however, ˜   which we aim to avoid with abstracted reduction (see also Section IV-A). For a sufficiently small F approximates this upper bound and further increasing β does not allow further reduction of ˆΣ(s). This value of β is in some sense optimal, as ˆΣ(s) is reduced as far as possible using Algorithm 2, and further increasing β only results in an increased order of ˆE(s) and thus in an increased computational cost of the reduction. This value is however only attainable through iterative evaluation of the resulting rΣ and rE for variable β, which is very costly itself. Augmented weighting Gu and Gy   Weighting matrices Gu and Gy scale the magnitude of the augmented outputs. Intuitively, increasing their magnitude therefore increases the importance of the augmented outputs, i.e., the 22-partition of Fl( ˆF , Σ) as in (10), with respect to the external inputs and outputs of Fl( ˆE, Σ). Large Gu and Gy would therefore improve the approximation Fl( ˆF , Σ)22, such that fewer states are required to achieve ˜ΛF ∈ ˜ F , whereas small Gu and Gy would improve the approximation Fl( ˆF , Σ)11 = Fl(E, Σ). Thus, the magnitudes of Gu and Gy give a trade-off between accuracy of Fl(E, ˆΣ) and the amount of reduction. This means that for smaller Gu and Gy, ΛC becomes smaller, i.e., the reduction becomes more conservative with respect to the specified C, because 1) there is more focus on the accuracy of Fl( ˆE, Σ) compared to Fl( ˆF , Σ)22 and 2) rΣ is increased.   In addition to the simple scaling of magnitudes, Gu and Gy   can also be related to VF (s) and WF (s), for instance, as Gu,ij = α (∥VF,ij∥2)−2 , Gy,ij = α (∥WF,ij∥2)−2 ,   where (.)ij denotes the i,j’th element of the transfer matrix, α is a scalar R>0 and ∥(.)∥2 denotes the H2-norm. By the inverse relation of (45), the reduction can be steered to focus most on the input-output pairs for which the bounds are tight, allowing further reduction. Additional frequency dependencies can also be reflected by augmentation with transfer matrices Gu(s) and Gy(s), which should be bistable and biproper to allow Lemma 2. This is considered out of the scope of this paper.   To evaluate the framework of abstracted reduction, we consider a structural-dynamics model for equipment in the lithography industry. The system, as shown schematically in Figure 9, represents a simplified, scaled-down frame of a lithography machine, consisting of several interconnected components. The system is a typical example of an intercon- nected structural dynamics system encountered in industry.   The interconnected system is about 25×42×40 cm (x×y×z) and is made of 5 aluminium components (or subsystems), as shown in Figure 9: two plates of different thickness, a frame for the support of optical equipment, a bridge-like frame and a frame of beams connecting all components. The two plates are connected to the ground with three translational springs with a stiffness of 1010 N/m each and three rotational springs with a stiffness of 105 Nm/rad each in two locations per plate, see   2) In Section VI-B, we evaluate the frequency-based robust abstracted reduction framework of Section V-B, where we input C(ω) and reduce the thin plate to an order rΣ, such that the resulting ΛC(s) ∈ C(ω), for all ω ∈ . The abstracted environment ˆE(s) is obtained by the Hintz-Herting (HH) component mode synthesis method [34], whereas the reduction of Σ(s) (a component model) is per- formed using Closed-Loop Balanced Reduction (CLBR), as introduced by Ceton and Wortelboer et al. [18, 19]. Specifi- cally, the reduction of Σ(s) is performed using residualization (also called singular perturbation), which retains the steady state transfer. See [6] for more details.   A. Fixed-order reduction   For this evaluation, all 5 subsystems are reduced to a lower order rΣ, as indicated in Table I, using the abstracted reduction approach introduced in this paper. To this end, we first formulate an environment model Ej, for each j ∈ {1, . . . , 5}, as the interconnection of all remaining subsystems Σl, l ∈ {1, . . . , 5}\\{j}, and then perform Algorithm 1 once for each subsystem Σj.   To properly evaluate the reduction of all Σj in the abstracted reduction framework, three balanced reduction methods are used: subsystem balanced reduction (ssBR), without taking the environment into account (see Figure 2a and [22]), in- terconnected systems balanced reduction (ISBR), taking its full environment into account (see Figure 2b and [9]), and abstracted reduction using CLBR (aCLBR), taking only an abstraction of the environment into account (see Figure 2c, Algorithm 1 and [19]). The three resulting reduction methods are then compared in terms of computational cost and the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order, interconnected model. The ISBR approach, as introduced by Vandendorpe and Van Dooren [9], is a generalization of CLBR. Whereas CLBR is only defined for 2 interconnected subsystems, ISBR reduces all k ≥ 2 subsystems to retain their relevance with respect to the interconnected system. For aCLBR, we use Gy = Gu = Om×m, i.e., no augmentation, to focus solely on the accuracy of Fl(E, ˆΣ).   The accuracy of the reduced-order, interconnected models is measured by visually comparing their frequency response functions (FRFs) with the FRFs of the unreduced intercon- nected model, the FRFs of their error ΛC(s) and the bounded L2-norm of ΛC(s) [20] (on the frequency-domain of 10 to 106 Hz, relevant for this application) given by  2π×106   Table II compares the computational cost of the reduc- tion methods1 and the obtained accuracy. Clearly, and as expected, ssBR is the most computationally efficient, as only the dynamics of the individual subsystem models are evaluated upon their reduction. ISBR, on the other hand, considers the full interconnected model dynamics, which results in a considerable increase in computational cost with a factor 12.   Figure 9. The components are connected to each other with linear springs with a stiffness of 108 N/m per spring in x-, y- and z-directions at the interface points shown in Figure 9. Each component has a modal damping factor [33] of 5% for each eigenmode. As a result, the interconnected model has no rigid-body modes and is asymptotically stable.   All components are modeled by high-order transfer function matrices with forces as their inputs and collocated displace- ments as outputs, such that the spring interconnection is represented by a static interconnection matrix [17]. The model order and the number of inputs and outputs per component model are indicated in Table I. The interconnected system has two external, collocated, force inputs and displacement outputs (mC = pC = 2): one at the interface between the thin plate and the beam frame in y-direction and one at the interface between the bridge and the beam frame in x-direction, as indicated in Figure 9.   The original interconnected system model, with an order of 2136, is too computationally costly for various industrial applications, such as real-time simulation, (low-order) con- troller synthesis, online monitoring, and sensitivity analysis. Therefore, in this section, we will reduce the interconnected system model to a lower order. Specifically, we will perform two evaluations:   1) In Section VI-A, we evaluate the abstracted reduction framework of Algorithm 1, where we select the re- duction orders rE and rΣ beforehand, as indicated in Table I, and reduce all subsystems.   By taking only an abstraction into account, aCLBR reduces this cost by a factor 6 to only twice the cost of ssBR.   Remark 8. When Σ(s) represents the beam frame, the order of Fl( ˆF , Σ) is 1128, which remains relatively high. This high order can be attributed to the disparity in order between the beam frame and the other subsystems. Recall that aCLBR demonstrates its greatest efficiency improvement when the environment is substantially larger than the subsystem, as illustrated in Figure 5. If all subsystems would be of similar size, the computational cost of aCLBR would approach the cost of ssBR.   As mentioned before, Table II also indicates the accuracy of the various reduced-order models (ROMs) by means of the (relative) L2-norm of the corresponding error systems. While all relative L2-norms are quite large due to the significant order reduction, a clear distinction in accuracy is observable. First of all, the ssBR-ROM results in a significantly higher L2 error norm than the other two ROMs. This is as expected,   as ssBR considers only the separate subsystems. Furthermore, the accuracy of the ISBR-ROM, in terms of its L2 error norm, shows a slight superiority with respect to the accuracy of the aCLBR-ROM. This small sacrifice in accuracy is a logical result from the introduced abstraction error with aCLBR. We can conclude that aCLBR is capable of achieving an accuracy level comparable to ISBR, while requiring computational cost almost competitive wth ssBR.   The magnitudes of the two collocated FRFs of the full-order model (FOM) of the interconnected system are visualized together with the FRFs of the three corresponding reduced- order models (ROMs) in Figures 10a and 10b. The FRFs of the collocated errors from ΛC(s), i.e., the differences between the FRFs of ROMs and of the FOM, are visualized underneath in Figures 10c and 10d. These error plots reflect in more detail the observations made above regarding the L2 error norms. Namely, the ssBR-ROM displays a clearly inferior accuracy with respect to the other two, whereas the accuracy of the ISBR- and aCLBR-ROMs seems similar.   Summarizing, we have evaluated (open-loop) subsystem reduction (ssBR), structure-preserving reduction (ISBR) and an abstract implementation (aCLBR), as presented in Algo- rithm 1, by means of a benchmark system from the field of structural dynamics. For this example, the proposed abstracted reduction approach achieves similar accuracy to the accurate but expensive ISBR method, while having a computational cost similar to the cheap but inaccurate ssBR method.   In this example, we will focus on the reduction of the thin plate, denoted Σ(s), such that the remaining (connected) components/subsystem models form the environment model E(s) with an order of nE = 1756, p + mC = 11 inputs and m + pC = 11 outputs. Our goal is to reduce Σ(s) to ˆΣ(s) with abstracted reduction, such that ΛC(iω) ∈ C(ω) for all ω ∈ , where ΛC := Fl(E, ˆΣ) − Fl(E, Σ).   We first select the frequency grid   as 250 logarithmically equidistantly spaced points between 5 Hz and 2 kHz. We then visualize the FRF matrices of Fl(E, Σ), E22(s) and Fl( ˆF , Σ), , as by means of their spectral norm per frequency in the black lines in Figure 11a, Figure 11b and Figure 11c, respectively.   To simplify interpretation of the accuracy specifications, we   restrict the scaling matrices to be of the form   VE(iω) = εE(ω)Ip, WE(iω) = εE(ω)Im, VF (iω) = εF (ω)Im, WF (iω) = εF (ω)Ip, WC(iω) = εC(ω)IpC , VC(iω) = εC(ω)ImC ,   for nonnegative, real scalars εE(ω), εF (ω), εC(ω). The error specifications can then be simplified to   E,22(ω) = {ΛE,22(iω) | ∥ΛE,22(iω)∥ < εE(ω)}, ˜ F (ω) = {˜ΛF (iω) | ∥˜ΛF (iω)∥ < εF (ω)}, C(ω) = {ΛC(iω) | ∥ΛC(iω)∥ < εC(ω)}.   We specify the allowed coupled inaccuracy   C(ω) by setting εC(ω) = 10−7, for all ω ∈ . The coupled inaccuracy specification C(ω) is visualized accordingly in Figure 11a as the blue area. This rather simple choice of εC(ω) emphasizes the accurate prediction of the resonance peaks, which might be relevant in, for example, a structural health monitoring use case where structural wear or damage may result in a frequency shift of the resonance peaks. The specifications F (ω) are subsequently determined using The-   orem 4 for a range of β.   The influence of β on the bounds εF and εE is visualized in Figure 12a. As explained in Section V-C, β influences the C(ω). Specifically, a distribution of the total error budget large β increases the bound εF (ω) at the cost of a smaller bound εE(ω). For β → ∞, only εF (ω) is maximized, regardless of εE(ω), i.e., εF (ω) is the bound on ˜ΛF (ω) if the full E(s) is considered instead of ˆE(s). For β = 0, the opposite occurs, and εE(ω) is maximized, regardless of εF (ω). However, the latter optimization problem is ill-posed as the F , because   E,22 is theoretically unbounded for an empty set ˜   for ˜ΛF = O, ˆΣ(s) = Σ(s) regardless of ˆE(s).   Naturally, a larger allowed error bound can be satisfied more easily by a reduced model, so that the model’s order can be decreased further. Therefore, varying β also allows a trade- off between rΣ and rE. Assuming Gy = Ip, Gu = Im, we can visualize this trade-off in Figure 12b. Note that we want to reduce Σ(s) as far as possible, i.e, nΣ − rΣ should be large, while nE − rE should only be sufficiently small to reduce the computational complexity of the reduction ap- proach. Figure 12b indicates that E(s) can be reduced by over   80% without significantly influencing the allowed reduction of Σ(s). This exemplifies the motivation of using environment abstraction for effective reduction of coupled systems.   In addition to the influence of β on   F , weighting matrices Gy and Gu determine ˆF (s), enabling to change the importance of the augmented outputs compared to the interconnected system outputs in the structure-preserving reduction of Fl( ˆF , Σ) (see Section V-C). To evaluate the influ- ence of these weighting matrices, we determine the maximum order reduction with weighting Gy = αIp, Gu = αIm for α = 0.01, 1, and 100, as visualized in Figure 13. As explained in Section V-C, a high value α favors the accuracy of the augmented outputs, such that, for a large α, ˜ΛF (s) would be relatively small, whereas ΛC(s) would be relatively large. This implies that for a given rE, a smaller rΣ would be   and rΣ = 63 (nE = 1756, nΣ = 380). The FRFs of ˆE22 and Fl( ˆF , ˆΣ)22 and their errors are visualized by red dashed lines in Figure 11b and Figure 11c, respectively, which are, by definition, fully included in the blue area. Interconnection of ˆΣ(s) with E(s) gives the reduced interconnected model Fl(E, ˆΣ), whose FRF and error are visualized by red dashed lines in Figure 11a, which are also well within the specification of C(ω). Remark 9. The full execution of the robust abstracted re- duction framework of Algorithm 2 using these settings takes approximately 450 s, of which most time is required to solve the optimization problem of Theorem 4. The computation time depends on the number of inputs and outputs of Σ (which determine the dimensions of N ) and the efficiency of the used numerical method. Currently, V −2(iω), W −2(iω) and Dℓ, Dr are solved iteratively using MOSEK [35]. However, there exist much more efficient methods to calculate bounds on µ∆(V N W ) (as used in Theorem 3) [36]. Incorporating such methods could potentially speed up the determination of E,22 and ˜ F significantly. This is, however, outside the scope of this paper and is left for further research.   The robust abstracted reduction framework allocates an error budget, εE(ω), to the reduction of E and, εF (ω), to the reduction of Σ. To reduce E and Σ as far as possible, we should aim to use as much of these budgets as pos- sible. However, the chosen reduction methods do not take these error budgets into account, resulting in considerable conservatism. This is especially apparent for the abstraction, where ∥ΛE,22(iω)∥ ≪ εE(ω) for most frequencies, as shown in Figure 11b. In addition, even when ∥ΛE,22(iω)∥ ≈ εE(ω), usually only one input-output pair restricts further reduction, while other input-output pairs are well within specification.   These two sources of conservatism result   in significant conservatism of the eventual reduced, interconnected model Fl(E, ˆΣ), as shown by difference of a factor 100 between actual error and allowed error. In addition, the reduced orders of rE = 184 and rΣ = 63 remain quite large. Through iterative reduction and evaluation of ΛC(s), a process that is far from C(ω), straightforward, we found that the specification of with εC(ω) = 10−7, for all ω ∈ , is achievable by aCLBR with rE = 20 and rΣ = 8 and by ssBR with rΣ = 22.   the above analysis gives insight   into the sensitivity of the resulting error ΛC(s) to inaccuracies of the environment model. Namely, the environment model can be reduced significantly without seriously impacting the resulting accuracy of the reduced interconnected system model. This observation therefore also strengthens the case for using the general abstracted reduction framework of Algorithm 1.   C. Key insights from numerical evaluation   For the considered use case, abstracted model reduction, as introduced in Section III and evaluated in Section VI-A, yielded an accuracy of the reduced interconnected system similar to the expensive structure-preserving method, while having a computational cost similar to the cheap subsystem reduction method. In other words, the framework of abstracted model reduction can significantly improve the computational   Fig. 13. Maximum reduction allowed for the environment model E(s) and thin plate model Σ to satisfy E,22(ω) and ˜ F (ω), respectively, for different weighting matrices Gu = αIp and Gy = αIm. required for ˜ΛF ∈ ˜ F if α is large. However, the results shown in Figure 13 are not consistent with this, as a larger α often allows less reduction of Σ(s), given a certain given rE. In addition, we observe a rather nonlinear relation between error bounds and reduction order, which makes it difficult to set proper α and β that result in the maximum reduction of E(s) and Σ(s). This inconsistency between the theory and the results of Figure 13 is attributed to the presented use case (where the dynamics of Σ relevant to the input-output behaviour of Σ and Fl(E, Σ) seems to align) and the non- optimality of CLBR (or weighted CLBR [8]). Further study is required to asses the influence of Gy and Gu in alternate use cases using other reduction methods.   Because the above evaluation of β and α to find ‘optimal’ values is usually too time-consuming (±1 hour for this use case), it is typically wise to select β > 1, which puts emphasis on reduction of Σ(s), accepting a higher order ˆE(s), resulting in a slightly higher computational cost (see Section V-C). For the remainder of the evaluation in this section, we will use β = 100. As CLBR does not respond intuitively to the weighting of Gy and Gu, we simply select Gy = Ip, Gu = Im.   The frequency-dependent accuracy specifications E,22(ω) and ˜ F (ω) for these choices of β, Gy and Gu are visualized by the blue areas in Figure 11b and Figure 11c, respectively. The environment model E(s) and augmented, abstracted sys- tem Fl( ˆF , Σ) are subsequently reduced as far as possible subject to ΛE,22(iω) ∈ E,22(ω), ˜ΛF (iω) ∈ ˜ F (ω), for all ω ∈ using Hintz-Herting reduction for the environment and CLBR for the thin plate model, resulting in rE = 184   tractability of structure preserving methods while retaining similar accuracy. This indicates that the low-order abstractions of the environment models are sufficient to indicate what subsystem dynamics needs to be retained to attain an accurate reduced-order interconnected system model.   This observation regarding the sufficiency of low-order abstractions is reaffirmed in the assessment of the robust abstracted reduction framework, as introduced in Section V and evaluated in Section VI-B, which showed that reducing the environment up to 80% does not significantly impact the reduced system. Although the evaluation in Section VI-B indicates that robust abstracted reduction tends to be conserva- tive, this tendency might significantly mitigated by utilization of alternative reduction methods. In addition, the stability guarantee, given by the robust abstracted reduction framework, remains valuable even in cases of conservatism.   We have introduced the framework of abstracted reduction to improve the tractability of the structure-preserving reduction of interconnected systems. In this framework, the structure- preserving reduction method is not applied to the full inter- connected system model, but to a single subsystem model con- nected to a low-order abstraction of its environment. By thus applying structure-preserving reduction to a much lower-order model, the computational cost of this reduction is significantly reduced. Leveraging techniques from robust performance, we introduced a second approach to also automatically determine (environment) abstraction and (subsystem) reduction orders that guarantee the reduced interconnected system model to be stable and to satisfy a prescribed H∞-accuracy specification. By means of a high-dimensional model representing an interconnected lithography machine frame, we have illustrated that employing a structure-preserving reduction method within the abstracted reduction framework can significantly decrease the reduction’s computational cost without significant loss of accuracy. Although the robust performance-based approach tends to yield a conservative reduced-order model of the inter- connected system, it effectively illustrates the relation between the introduced error budgets. It is important to emphasize that the introduced abstracted reduction framework is versatile, i.e., it is compatible with any structure-preserving reduction method. This versatility suggests the potential for numerous al- ternative implementations that offer enhanced accuracy, greater order reduction, and less conservatism compared to the current implementation.

To achieve\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nthis, we introduce the following dimensionless quantities [9]\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.5**\n˜xµ = mvxµ, ˜Φ =\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThen, the equations of motion for the rescaled quantities are formally equivalent to the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nEqs.

However, there is a key difference: the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngravitational constant G has been replaced by α2/(4π), where α is a free parameter related\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nto the vacuum expectation value through\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor the remainder of this paper, we will continue to omit the tildes for clarity. Consequently,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe only two free parameters of the theory are µ and α. In the next section, we will explore\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nstatic solutions for various values of these parameters.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe gravitational decoupling limit is effectively achieved by considering Eqs.

Despite this, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nphysical quantities can still be restored by choosing any value of v, since in the FLS model\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n(in Minkowski space), v can be rescaled out.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.3**\nIII.

Beyond\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthis region, the value of L increases, reaching a local maximum before decreasing toward the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nfinite EKG limit, which coincides with the limit α\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n. Notably, the maximum separation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nnear µ = 0.2 seems to increase without bound as α\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n0.

These branches are\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noften depicted in mass-frequency diagrams. In such diagrams, particularly for polynomial\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncomplex scalar field potentials, the frequency ω has a global minimum, and gravitationally\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstable configurations are located in regions where dM/dω < 0 and between the Newtonian\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlimit and the global minimum of ω (see [42–45] for some examples).

According to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe right plot of Fig. 4 all configurations between the zero mass solution and the minimum\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfrequency solution are gravitationally bound.

Next, we select several solutions, shown in Table I which are\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlocated in the stable branch, and use the stationary solutions obtained from the spectral\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nelliptic solver to generate initial data for Φ, Ψ, and gµν (along with their corresponding\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncanonical momenta).

None of these\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nconfigurations exhibit any signs of instability, even those that differ significantly from the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nEKG case in both their scalar and gravitational components. Confident in the presented\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\napproach for constructing and evolving these configurations, we proceed to explore the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ndipolar configurations, which possess markedly different dynamical properties.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe confirm that dipolar boson stars near the EKG limit are unstable. In the following\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nanalysis, we focus primarily on the cases with ω = 0.9, unless otherwise noted, in which case\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwe consider ω = 0.8 for generality. For instance, several of the dipolar configurations listed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin Table II can be shown to be close, or very close, to their corresponding EKG counterparts.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn particular, the three configurations with α2 = 4π display global quantities nearly identical\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto those of the dipolar mini-boson star.

These cases also proved\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto be unstable. We further tested cases with ω = 0.8, since this frequency lies within the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncandidate stable branch when µ decreases (as seen in Fig. 2, particularly for α2 = 0.25).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHowever, these configurations also turned out to be unstable. All these configurations start\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nto develop an instability before t\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n2000 but not after t\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure 5 illustrates the typical behavior of the instability. Notably, in all cases studied, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninstability remains axisymmetric, in contrast to the spinning case, where non-axisymmetric\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninstabilities are present, as shown in [50]. To verify the axisymmetric nature of the instability,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwe have compared the same quantities shown in Fig. 5 in both the y = 0 plane (as presented)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand the x = 0 plane. Additionally, we verified the lapse function in the z = 0 plane its\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\naxisymmetry throughout the evolution.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOne important feature to note in Fig. 5, particularly in panel (a), is that the growth of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nperturbation is not symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. Specifically, the energy\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndensity and spacetime metric exhibit a breaking of their even symmetry.

         " V´ıctor Jaramillo1, ∗ and Shuang-Yong Zhou2, 3, †   The investigation of self-gravitating scalar field configurations in 3 dimensional asymp-   totically flat spacetime has garnered significant interest in recent decades, primarily due to   the fundamental role scalar fields play in models of dark matter, inflation and early Universe   evolution. Scalar fields can lead to gravitational collapse, forming localized gravitating ob-   jects such as boson stars [1, 2]—compact, stationary and horizonless configurations where   the scalar field exhibits harmonic time dependence. Beyond boson stars, flat space solitons,   which are spatially localized field configurations, are widely studied across various fields of   theoretical physics, including cosmology and quantum field theory. These solitons can be   topological, stabilized by a conserved topological number, or non-topological, like Q-balls   [3–5], which arise in field models with continuous global symmetry and exhibit a stationary   oscillating internal phase.   Interestingly, certain gravitating solutions such as some particular models of boson stars,   monopoles, and Skyrmions are closely related to their flat space counterparts, representing   non-topological solitons or Q-balls, and exhibit intriguing dynamics when coupled with   gravity. Q-balls can be realized in two scenarios, the single complex scalar field with a non-   renormalizable self-interaction potential found by Coleman in the 80’s [5] and the earlier two-   component model found by Friedberg, Lee and Sirlin which contains a symmetry breaking   potential [4]. The Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) model provides a compelling example of a   renormalizable scalar field theory with natural interaction terms, where a complex scalar   field gains mass through coupling with a real scalar field that acquires a finite vacuum   expectation value via a symmetry-breaking potential. This interaction gives rise to Q-ball   solutions, which emerge from the phase rotation of the complex scalar field. When coupled   with gravity, these Q-balls manifest as boson stars.   The FLS model has been studied in various contexts. In flat spacetime, it was shown   that solutions exist even when the scalar potential vanishes, rendering the real scalar field   massless [6]. Additionally, axially symmetric spinning solutions with both even and odd   parity were constructed in [6], and a U(1)-gauged generalization, which generates a dipolar   magnetic field, was explored in [7]. In [8], the superradiance of Q-balls in the FLS model   was investigated, demonstrating the potential for amplifying incident waves. When coupled   minimally with gravity, the FLS model has been studied in various scenarios. Boson stars   in this theory were first constructed in [9], where spherical and spinning solutions were   found to be connected to their flat spacetime counterparts. The spherical solutions were   revisited in the U(1)-gauged case in [10] and further studied in [11] with a focus on their   astrophysical signatures.   In [12], a vector analogue of the FLS model was introduced to   add self-interactions to the Proca model, avoiding hyperbolicity issues. Remarkably, the   Einstein-FLS model also supports black hole solutions, as explored in [10, 13, 14].   Einstein’s gravity, minimally coupled to free scalar fields, gives rise to families of static   solutions beyond the spherical case, exhibiting rich structures. These are known as mul-   tipolar boson stars [15]. The simplest of these non-spherical configurations is the dipolar   boson star [16, 17], a two-center soliton in equilibrium due to the balance between grav-   itational attraction and repulsion caused by the phase difference in the odd-parity scalar   field. However, this equilibrium is inherently unstable [18], though self-interactions similar   to the Coleman Q-ball scalar potential have been found to stabilize the dipole [19]. Beyond   the dipole, chains of solitons have also been studied [15, 20], including chains of rotating   stars [21, 22] and self-interacting configurations [23]. Similar multipolar configurations have   also been shown to form dynamically when initial components are prepared with opposite   charges that swap over time [24–28]. Additionally, dipolar boson stars have a close relation   with recent constructions of equilibrium systems involving two black holes [29, 30].   Notably, chains of boson stars, including dipolar configurations, do not have a flat space   limit. The Klein-Gordon field alone cannot support dipolar static equilibrium solutions, even   with generic self-interactions, as the gravitational attraction needed for balance is absent   (see Sec. 5.2 of [17] and [31] for a detailed argument). In contrast, other theories, such as   the Yang-Mills monopole-antimonopole [32], Skyrmions [33], and others (reviewed in [31]),   do admit such solutions. Of particular interest are the even chains of spinning and charged   Q-balls in the Maxwell-FLS model [34].   The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the existence of Einstein-FLS dipolar so-   lutions, explore their stability within a region of parameter space using full 3D nonlinear   evolutions, and show that flat space non-rotating Q-chains can also be constructed in the   standard FLS model. The paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we present the   Einstein-FLS model, its equations, and the ansatz. In Sec. III, we construct the solutions   and investigate their properties. The stability analysis of the dipolar solutions is addressed   in Sec. IV, and in Sec. V, we construct static Q-dipoles, Q-chains and gravitating chains.   We conclude with a discussion in Sec. VI.   We consider the 3+1 dimensional FLS model minimally coupled to Einstein’s gravity,   which describes a self-gravitating system consisting of a complex scalar field Φ and a real   scalar field Ψ. The corresponding action is given by   where R is the Ricci scalar, g the determinant of the spacetime metric gµν and m is the   coupling constant between the two scalar fields. The action contains the potential of the    which introduces the positive parameter µ2 and v, the vacuum expectation value of Ψ.   Throughout this paper we will use the signature (   , +, +, +) and units where c = 1.   According to Eq. (1), the complex scalar field Φ acquires mass through its coupling with   the real scalar field Ψ, with the mass of Φ given by mv. In contrast, the mass of the real   scalar field is √8µv.   The model described by Eq. (1) is invariant under the global U(1) transformation Φ   Φiα. The associated conserved Noether current is jµ = i (Φ∗   served charge is   → µΦ∗) and the con-   The field equations are obtained by varying S with respect to the metric, the complex   scalar field and the real scalar field. Correspondingly we obtain the Einstein equations   Rgµν = 8πG Tµν;   and the equations for the scalar fields   Interestingly, solitons in this model exist and can be constructed even in the limit where   the potential vanishes, µ   0, both in flat spacetime [6] and in curved spacetimes [9]. In these   cases, Ψ becomes massless and exhibits long-range behavior with a Coulomb-like asymptotic   decay. In the opposite limit, where the real scalar field becomes infinitely massive, µ   → ∞ with fixed v, Ψ simplifies to Ψ = v, and the system described by Eq. (1) reduces to the   Einstein-Klein-Gordon (EKG) theory. This is a crucial observation, as we will begin our   search for dipolar configurations in the full theory (1) by starting with the general relativistic   dipolar solutions [16].   The model in Eq. (1) contains the parameters m, µ, and v. However, the parameter   m can be eliminated (and thought of as setting the scale of the physical system), and the   parameter v can be reinterpreted as an effective gravitational coupling constant. To achieve   this, we introduce the following dimensionless quantities [9]   ˜xµ = mvxµ, ˜Φ =   Then, the equations of motion for the rescaled quantities are formally equivalent to the   Eqs. (4)-(7) after making the substitution m = 1, v = 1:   Rgµν = 2α2 Tµν;   Here, we have dropped the tildes for simplicity. However, there is a key difference: the   gravitational constant G has been replaced by α2/(4π), where α is a free parameter related   to the vacuum expectation value through   For the remainder of this paper, we will continue to omit the tildes for clarity. Consequently,   the only two free parameters of the theory are µ and α. In the next section, we will explore   static solutions for various values of these parameters.   The gravitational decoupling limit is effectively achieved by considering Eqs. (9)-(11)   with α = 0. However, it is important to note that in this flat spacetime limit, the physical   quantities cannot be recovered using Eq. (8), as α = 0 implies v = 0. Despite this, the   physical quantities can still be restored by choosing any value of v, since in the FLS model   (in Minkowski space), v can be rescaled out.   In the limit where the real scalar field Ψ becomes infinitely massive, the system reduces to   the EKG model, in which equilibrium solutions for two boson stars are known to exist [16].   These horizonless dipolar configurations are non-spinning and regular everywhere [17]. In   line with these considerations, we adopt the following static and axisymmetric line element,   and for the scalar fields, we consider the following ansatz consistent with the previous as-   sumptions   Φ = ϕ(r, θ)e−iωt , Ψ = ψ(r, θ) .   The parameter ω is an unknown quantity in the model, determined by the boundary con-   ditions. The five functions Fi (i = 0, 1, 2), ϕ, and ψ depend on the radial coordinate r and   the polar angle θ. The boundary conditions used to construct dipolar stars are specified as   follows. Asymptotic flatness requires:   together with the condition ω < 1 in order to achieve the vacuum value for the complex   field ϕ r→∞ = 0. Regularity of the solution at the origin and on the symmetry axis require, |   We impose that the spacetime remains invariant under reflection across the θ = π/2 plane,   while we impose the complex scalar field Φ to change sign. In this sense the complex scalar   field is assumed to have odd parity with respect to a reflection along the equatorial plane   θ = π/2. Specifically, this condition implies that the derivatives of the metric functions with   respect to θ vanish at θ = π/2:   According to the previous z = 0 plane symmetry conditions, the integration domain can be   reduced to the region 0   Next, we present the explicit equations to be solved for the metric functions and the   two scalar fields. These equations can be expressed in a compact form using the operators   and combinations of the Einstein equations’ tensorial components as outlined in [35]. To   proceed, we first consider the 3+1 gravitational source terms ρ = Tµνnµnν (energy density)   β + nαnβ; both β (stress tensor), with nα = (e−F0, 0, 0, 0) and γα geometrical quantities properly defined in Sec IV. The Einstein equations for the metric   (13) are then given by:   ∆3F0 = 4πGA2 (ρ + S)   − 1) r sin θ] = 8πGN A2Br sin θ   − ∆2 (F1 + F0) = 8πGA2Sφ   where N = eF0 (lapse function), A = eF1, B = eF2 and the operators ∆i correspond to the   i-dimensional flat Laplacian and ∂f ∂g is the product of the gradients of f and g. All of   these operators acting on two dimensional r, θ dependent functions.   To determine the explicit form of the source terms based on the ansatz for the metric   and fields, we derive the following expressions:   Using the differential operators previously introduced, the equation of motion for Φ and   Ψ reduce to   − The resulting set of five coupled nonlinear elliptic differential equations, (19)-(20), (25),   and (26), subject to the boundary conditions (16), (17), and (18), is solved numerically.   We employ the spectral methods library Kadath [36, 37] to solve this elliptic system. In   the solver, we utilize the Polar space module, which facilitates the compactification of r.   For all dipolar configurations in this work, we used 17 Chebyshev spectral coefficients in   both the r and θ directions, distributed across 8 radial domains with boundaries at r = 2i   , 6). Beyond dipolar cases (as those presented in Sec. V) we have employed the   same radial domains but 25 spectral coefficients in some cases.   The solver employs an iterative Newton-Raphson scheme, which requires an initial guess   for the functions to initiate the iterative process and ensure convergence to a solution. This   process is delicate, however we found that the following initial guess enables a successful   iterative process when µ   star solution:   , allowing the system to converge to the EKG dipolar boson   where ϕ0 = 10−2, x = r sin θ, z = r cos θ, σ2   1 (θ, φ) is the spherical   harmonic with ℓ = 1 and m = 0. In this process, ω is treated as an unknown, and to prevent   convergence to the trivial vacuum solution, we impose that the lapse function N at the   center of the dipole satisfies N (r = 0) = N0 = 0.9404. The iterative process is terminated and a solution is obtained when the residual drops below 10−8.   Once the first solution is obtained, the remaining dipolar boson star solutions in the   theory (1) can be generated by gradually varying the theory’s parameters (α, µ) and the   value of the lapse function at the origin. We found that the lapse function at the center is   a useful quantity for parametrizing sequences of solutions with fixed (α, µ). In this way, we   constructed the equilibrium family of two-boson star solutions in the EKG theory.   For finite µ, solutions are obtained by using a corresponding equal-frequency EKG solu-   tion as an initial guess and gradually decreasing the values of µ and α. Each solution has a   specific value of charge, determined by Eq. (3). The other key quantities that characterize   the dipolar stars are the total mass and the separation between the two components. We   extract the value of the mass by comparing the numerical solutions with the asymptotic   sub-leading expansion for the lapse function,   O To facilitate comparison with the previously reported µ   solutions [15, 17, 18], we will   follow the approach presented in [12] and report the quantity M Gv.1 In addition to the   expression (28), we have used the Komar integral [38, 39]   to check for numerical accuracy of the solutions. The relative errors between the two def-   initions of mass are on the order of 10−6. Solutions were discarded whenever this error   indicator exceeded 10−3.   The separation between the dipolar components can be determined by locating the sym-   metric maxima of the energy density ρ, which are situated along the z-axis at positions with   r = z0. Thus, the relevant quantity related to the separation of the two stars is defined as   the proper distance between the points z =   We begin our analysis by examining the influence of the model parameters on the properties   of the solutions. To this end, we fix the frequency of the scalar field oscillations to ω = 0.9;   the significance of this choice will become clear shortly. In Fig. 1, we present the separation   as a function of the real scalar field mass µ for various values of the gravitational coupling   The first observation from Fig. 1 is that solutions exist even in the case of a vanishing   potential, similar to the spherically symmetric case reported in [6]. Additionally, the config-   urations appear to converge to the same value of L in the µ   1 region. We have examined   other quantities in this limit and found that they rescale according to specific relations, such   as M = c1µ + c2 and Q = c3µ + c4 with c1, c2, c3 and c4 constants that depend slightly in   the specific value of α. The constants c3 and c4 are within the interval (15.5, 16.2). Beyond   this region, the value of L increases, reaching a local maximum before decreasing toward the   finite EKG limit, which coincides with the limit α   . Notably, the maximum separation   near µ = 0.2 seems to increase without bound as α   0. This observation will be important   in Sec. V, where we discuss the existence of chain solutions in flat spacetime.   Many, bosonic star configurations that possess stable solutions against small perturba-   tions lie along distinctive branches, clearly separated from unstable branches in their domain   of existence (see e.g., the reviews [40, 41] on the dynamics of boson stars). These branches are   often depicted in mass-frequency diagrams. In such diagrams, particularly for polynomial   complex scalar field potentials, the frequency ω has a global minimum, and gravitationally   stable configurations are located in regions where dM/dω < 0 and between the Newtonian   limit and the global minimum of ω (see [42–45] for some examples). This pattern also   holds true for self-interacting dipolar stars [19]. Thus, it is instructive to examine the mass-   frequency diagrams of the solutions presented here. In Fig. 2, we display the mass-frequency   diagrams for two cases of coupling to gravity α and the selected values of the real scalar   field mass µ = 0, 0.25, and 0.5. In particular we present the full sequence of solutions for   both the largest and smallest values of α considered in Fig. 1. With reasonable confidence,   we establish that all configurations plotted for L, with ω = 0.9, reside along the candidate   stable branch, connecting the (M = 0, ω = 1) point with the critical mass configuration in   each case.   Also from comparing both panels in Fig. 2, we confirm that for a given value of µ,   the solutions deviate more from the EKG limit as α decreases. Additionally, the range of   frequency values ω for which solutions exist expands as both µ and α decrease. In particular,   for the case µ = 0, α2 = 0.00625 (right panel, blue line), we could not identify the critical   mass configuration or the minimum frequency solution. Beyond the minimum ω obtained   and presented in the plot for this sequence, the error indicator obtained by comparing the   mass definitions (28) and (29) exceeded the 0.1% of relative difference, and after a few more   points with smaller ω, the code could no longer converge.   Some insight into the potential stability of the solutions can also be gained from mass-   charge (M -Q) diagrams. Classical stability criteria for Q-balls have been applied to boson   stars [40] to establish a necessary condition for equilibrium configurations to be gravitation-   ally bound and unlikely to fragment under small perturbations.   It is important to note,   however, that gravitationally unbound yet stable configurations have been found for a log-   arithmic scalar potential [24]. Additionally, there are numerous examples of gravitating   systems that, while classically stable in the sense that mbQ > M , with mb the boson mass,   are actually unstable. For instance, dipolar boson stars in the EKG theory exhibit such   behavior [18, 19]. In Fig. 3, the M (Q) curves for the dipolar FLS model are displayed, cor-   responding to the same configurations as in Fig. 2. We see that all solutions in the candidate   stable branch, in the line connecting M = 0 with max(M ) in each case, satisfy the condition   M < vQ. Therefore correspond to configurations with negative binding energy and are not   expected to fission under the effect of small perturbations. We will see in the next section   that unlike EKG dipolar boson stars, configurations in the candidate stable branch are not   always unstable.   After mapping out the domain of existence for dipolar stars in the Einstein-FLS theory,   we now explore the stability of these configurations by evolving a broad range of cases.   While we confirm that the two previously established stability criteria are necessary for   achieving perturbatively stable solutions, we find that they are not sufficient for all values   of the parameters µ and α.   In this section, we aim to explore the dynamical stability of the previously constructed   isolated static solutions. By evolving these configurations, we can assess their response   to perturbations and understand their long-term behavior. To achieve this, we will use   the static solutions as initial data for our dynamical simulations. These systems will be   subjected to small perturbations arising from the truncation errors inherent in the numerical   implementation, and additional perturbations will be introduced by hand to study non-static   configurations from the onset. This approach allows us to thoroughly test the stability of   the dipolar stars through the model parameter space.   To track the system’s dynamics, we implemented a numerical code capable of solving the Einstein-FLS system. This was accomplished using the Einstein Toolkit framework [46– 48], with mesh refinement handled by the Carpet package [49]. As a preparatory step, we   performed a Cauchy (3+1) decomposition of the scalar field equations of motion Eqs. (6),   (7) and evolve initial data in the full two-component Einstein-FLS model. We cast the field   equations into the 3+1 form by considering the spacetime line element   gµνdxµdxν =   βiβi)dt2 + 2γijβidtdxj + γijdxidxj ,   and introducing the extrinsic curvature, defined as   where N is the lapse function, βi is the shift vector, γij is the metric defined on the hyper-   surfaces of constant coordinate t and   is the Lie derivative.   The evolutions were performed by adapting an existing “thorn” in the toolkit, which   solves for multiple complex scalar fields using finite differences [50–52]. The FLS system   was numerically integrated using fourth-order spatial discretization provided by the toolkit’s   infrastructure. This toolkit solves the Einstein equations within the ADM 3+1 framework,   utilizing the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) formulation for evolving space- time variables [53, 54]. The McLachlan thorn [55] was used to evolve spacetime, with   matter source terms derived from the energy-momentum tensor (5) for the complex and real   scalar field coupled system.   For all evolutions, we applied the 1+log slicing condition for the lapse function N and   the Gamma-driver condition for the shift vector βi [56]. To evolve the scalar fields Φ and Ψ   over time, Φ was decomposed into its real and imaginary components   Φ = Φr + iΦi ,   and the BSSN formulation was coupled to the evolution equations for these components and   which define a the canonical momentum variables associated to the scalar fields and evolve   according to the equations   ˜γij ˜Di∂jΦr +   KKΦi − ˜γij∂iN ∂jΦi ,   ˜γij∂iΦr∂jχ +   ˜γij ˜Di∂jΨ +   − ˜γij∂iN ∂jΨ ,   ˜γij∂iΨ∂jχ + (Φ2   To solve these equations we employed the MoL thorn, which utilizes a fourth-order Runge-   Kutta scheme for time integration. In the Eqs. (35), K represents the trace of the extrinsic   curvature, and the BSSN formulation introduces the conformal factor χ, defining a confor-   mal spatial metric ˜γij with unit determinant via the relation ˜γij = χγij. The formulation also introduces ˜D, the covariant derivative compatible with this conformal metric. These   adjustments support (numerically) stable evolution and accurate coupling between matter   and geometry in our simulations.   Mesh refinement was managed using Carpet. The fixed mesh refinement grid hierarchy   consisted of nested rectangular domains with three levels of refinement, with the finest level   encompassing the entire configuration. The physical grid spans a cube with a side length of   200 units. Since all fields involved are axisymmetric, we impose symmetry along both the x   and y axes. Given that the matter clumps are aligned along the z-axis, we extend the inner   refinement levels to be 1.5 times longer in the z-dimension than in the x and y dimensions.   To ensure the star’s properties are accurately captured, we set the spatial resolution on the   finest refinement level to ∆xi = 0.5, and on the coarsest level to ∆xi = 4.0.   As a preliminary sanity check, before proceeding with the dipolar star evolutions, we   first consider spherical boson stars, which are not expected to deviate from the established   stability scenario for free scalar field spherical boson stars (in particular in the µ   1 cases). It is worth noting, however, that no stability analysis has been conducted   for these configurations in the literature. Nevertheless, the static spherical solutions were   presented in [9] and further analyzed in [11], as mentioned in the introduction.   We have constructed spherical boson stars2. and present the equilibrium sequence of them   in Fig. 4 for a single value of α and µ between 0 and 0.5. As expected that configurations   differ more from the mini-boson star monotonically with decreasing value of µ. According to   the right plot of Fig. 4 all configurations between the zero mass solution and the minimum   frequency solution are gravitationally bound. In particular this means all solutions ω = 0.9   are not expected to disperse. Next, we select several solutions, shown in Table I which are   located in the stable branch, and use the stationary solutions obtained from the spectral   elliptic solver to generate initial data for Φ, Ψ, and gµν (along with their corresponding   canonical momenta). This is achieved by interpolating the spectral coefficients onto the   Cartesian grid of the evolution code. We then evolve the system up to t = 104, allowing   the truncation error from the numerical code to naturally perturb the star. None of these   configurations exhibit any signs of instability, even those that differ significantly from the   EKG case in both their scalar and gravitational components. Confident in the presented   approach for constructing and evolving these configurations, we proceed to explore the   dipolar configurations, which possess markedly different dynamical properties.   We confirm that dipolar boson stars near the EKG limit are unstable. In the following   analysis, we focus primarily on the cases with ω = 0.9, unless otherwise noted, in which case   we consider ω = 0.8 for generality. For instance, several of the dipolar configurations listed   in Table II can be shown to be close, or very close, to their corresponding EKG counterparts.   In particular, the three configurations with α2 = 4π display global quantities nearly identical   to those of the dipolar mini-boson star. We evolved these configurations for three values of   the real scalar field mass, µ = 0, 0.25, and 0.5, finding all of them to be unstable.   Next, we conducted a broad scan of the parameter space, focusing on the cases where   α2 = 0.25 and α2 = 0.1, which already deviate from the EKG limit. These cases also proved   to be unstable. We further tested cases with ω = 0.8, since this frequency lies within the   candidate stable branch when µ decreases (as seen in Fig. 2, particularly for α2 = 0.25).   However, these configurations also turned out to be unstable. All these configurations start   to develop an instability before t   2000 but not after t   Figure 5 illustrates the typical behavior of the instability. Notably, in all cases studied, the   instability remains axisymmetric, in contrast to the spinning case, where non-axisymmetric   instabilities are present, as shown in [50]. To verify the axisymmetric nature of the instability,   we have compared the same quantities shown in Fig. 5 in both the y = 0 plane (as presented)   and the x = 0 plane. Additionally, we verified the lapse function in the z = 0 plane its   axisymmetry throughout the evolution.   One important feature to note in Fig. 5, particularly in panel (a), is that the growth of the   perturbation is not symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. Specifically, the energy   density and spacetime metric exhibit a breaking of their even symmetry. The initial phase   of the instability is characterized by an antisymmetric oscillation with respect to the z = 0   plane, which intensifies over time and ends up in a perturbed spheroidal state. With this   particular values of the parameters the end-point corresponds to a regular and horizonless   solution however the instability developed in some other cases lead to the formation of a   black hole. We will present some examples of this in Sec. V   By further decreasing the value of α and focusing on the region 0   0.5, we enter   a parameter space zone where prominent peaks in the separation L are observed, as seen   In this region, we have identified stable solutions. To precisely delineate the   stability region, we systematically explored the range 0.0125   0.25 in increments of   ∆α2 = 0.0125, along with the case α2 = 0.00625. For each value of α, we examined the   0.25 in steps of ∆µ = 0.05, as well as the case µ = 0.5.   From this extensive set of evolutions, we present in the Table III the stable configura-   tions obtained. For clarity, Fig. 6 highlights the regions of stability. Among the unstable   configurations in the range 0.0125   0.25, we observed that the   timescale for the onset of instability can be quite long, extending up to t = 5   cases. So in order to further test the dynamical robustness of the dipoles that do not show   signs of instability before t = 104, we introduced a forced perturbation at initial times which   breaks the symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane in the Tµν matter sources. This   perturbation is applied as follows:   Φ(r, θ; t = 0) + a max(Φ) exp   The max(Φ) correspond to the absolute maximum of the unperturbed Φ which always is   obtained in z > 0 and is reported in Table III and a is a parameter that controls the   strength of the perturbation. This perturbation slightly increases the energy density near   the “star” above z = 0, thereby breaking the symmetry along the z = 0 plane. The resulting   change in energy density requires an adjustment in the metric, which we achieve by solving   the Hamiltonian constraint. Specifically, we apply the conformal thin sandwich formalism,   solving the Lichnerowicz equation to obtain the new metric functions F1 and F2, which are conformally related to the original ones3.   We find that all the configurations listed in Table III remain stable, continuing to evolve   around a dipolar static configuration close to the unperturbed state, even when subjected   to the artificial perturbation with a = 0.05. The perturbation applied is relatively strong,   modifying in 5% of the initial value of the complex field. Applying stronger perturbations   drive some of the configurations, in particular those in the boundaries of the stability region   represented in Fig. 6, out of equilibrium.   To illustrate the resilience of these configurations, even under forced perturbations, in   Fig. 7 we show the evolution of the highest α configuration found to be stable, corresponding   to µ = 0.15, ω = 0.9, and α2 = 0.05 in Table III. The floor value of the energy density   remains bounded and oscillating, while the harmonic dependence of the scalar field stays   very close to the original frequency ω = 0.9 throughout the evolution. In these simulation   we have verified that the geometrical quantities N and γij follow the matter dynamics and   also oscillate around a configuration close to the unperturbed state used in the preparation   of the initial data.   To further analyze the stability of these configurations, we examine the behavior of the   scalar fields at a considerable distance from the source. For this purpose, we calculate the   surface integral of the real part of the complex field Φ at a radius of 120, normalized by its   maximum value at t = 0. Fig. 8 displays the scalar radiation produced by two configurations:   an unstable one with µ = 0, α2 = 0.25 (as in Fig. 5), and a stable configuration with µ = 0.15   and α2 = 0.05 (as in Fig. 6).   In both cases, we apply a forced perturbation with amplitude a = 0.05. As expected,",

The\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHeisenberg exchange interaction contains both an Ising interaction term and an XY interaction term.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nCombined with the Zeeman energy difference between qubits, the diabatic pulse executes a two-qubit\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngate that can be decomposed into two parts: One is a CPhase operation due to the Ising interaction,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwith a rotating angle  𝜂0 = 𝐽𝑡, where  𝑡  is the duration of the diabatic pulse 33. The other part, as shown\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin Fig. 1(b), is a rotation operation in the subspace of the antiparallel states, produced by the combined\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\neffect  of  XY  interaction  and  the  non-zero  ∆𝐸𝑍 .  This  operation  introduces  a  rotation  with  an\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\naccumulated phase of  𝜙0 = 𝛥𝐸𝑡  around a tilted axis  with  𝜃0 = arctan (\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\n)  37, where  𝛥𝐸  is  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nenergy difference between the antiparallel states  |↑↓̃ ⟩  and  |↓↑̃ ⟩.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFigure  1(c)  shows  𝐽, 𝛥𝐸   and  𝛥𝐸𝑧   at  different  𝜀 ,  and  Fig.  1(d)  gives  the  corresponding  three\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noperation  angles  𝜙0, 𝜃0, and 𝜂0 . With  increasing  𝜀 ,  𝐽   increases  while  𝛥𝐸𝑧   decreases  due  to  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nStark shift 38, 39. Here we define  𝜀 = 0    at the symmetric operation point (point C in Fig. 1(c) insert)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n36 and positive  𝜀  corresponds to higher energy for  QR. We calculate  𝜂0  and  𝜃0  while guaranteeing\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe operation duration  𝜏𝑠  making  𝜙0 = 𝜋  at different  𝜀. With  𝜀  increases,  𝜃0  and  𝜂0  increase as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwell,  while  𝜂0   will  gradually  converge  to  𝜙0 ,  due  to  the  approached  𝐽   and  𝛥𝐸 . At  the  detuning\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\n,  a  diabatic  CZ  gate  can  be  realized  since  𝜂0 = 𝐽𝑡 = 𝜋   and  𝜙0 = 2𝜋   will\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noccur simultaneously, during which only the Ising interaction part remained.

The  two  parts  of  two-qubit  operations  introduced  by  the  native  exchange\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAlthough a single-segment diabatic pulse can implement a two-qubit CPhase gate or a SWAP gate,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n. When this parameter requirement cannot be\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsatisfied, the iSWAP operation and the CPhase operation are always implemented simultaneously and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninevitably mixed, thus the combined two-qubit operation will not be any of the essential two-qubit\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngates. And this final gate operation is the results of mixed effect of the Zeeman energy difference, plus\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIsing interaction and XY interaction in the native exchange interaction. Although we know the speed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof these two operations accurately, we are still limited by the need to adjust the operation angles, since\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwe cannot control their relative rates effectively and separately. If the operation angles of the iSWAP\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noperation and the CPhase operation can be controlled separately, a diverse set of combined two-qubit\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngates will be available, and the exchange interaction between the spins can be sufficiently utilized.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nComposite Gate Scheme. To overcome the difficulties associated with a single-segment diabatic pulse,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwe introduce a versatile gate implemented by a three-segment composite pulse, which can separately\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncontrol the operation angle of the CPhase operation and iSWAP operation. As shown in Fig. 2(a), for\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\na  composite  pulse  composed  of  three  continuous  diabatic  square  pulses,  we  adjust  𝜂𝑖   and  𝜃𝑖   by\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nchanging the amplitude of each segment as well as having each segment implementing an operation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwith  𝜙𝑖 = 𝜋   by  changing  the  pulse  durations.  The  total  operator  of  this  composite  pulse  (see\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nSupplementary Note 1 for a detailed theoretical derivation) takes the form\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.6**\ncos(𝜃1 − 𝜃2 + 𝜃3)\n\n0 −𝑖 sin(𝜃1 − 𝜃2 + 𝜃3)\n\n𝑍𝐿 (−\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\n−𝑖 sin(𝜃1 − 𝜃2 + 𝜃3)\ncos(𝜃1 − 𝜃2 + 𝜃3)\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.6**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.2**\n𝑒−𝑖𝜋[sin(𝜃1)+sin(𝜃2)+sin(𝜃3)]\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhere the indices denote the three segments, and  𝛾𝐿  and  𝛾𝑅  are the single-qubit local phases of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntwo qubits. Analogous to the single-segment diabatic pulse, the three-segment pulse also consists of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthree components, including a single-qubit rotation, a two-qubit CPhase operation, and a rotation in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nthe  two-qubit  subspace  always  with  𝜃 =\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n.  In  this  paper,  we  will  focus  on  the  two-qubit  gate\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noperations. Figure 2(b) shows the evolution trajectory of the qubit states while applying a composite\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npulse.  Specifically,  the  CPhase  operation  angle  𝜂 = [sin(𝜃1) + sin(𝜃2) + sin(𝜃3)]𝜋    is  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsuperposition of the CPhase operations of each segment, as the consequence of the Ising component\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nof the exchange interaction. In addition, the superposition of the rotation operations in the two-qubit\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsubspace  leads  to  a  two-qubit  iSWAP  operation  with  a  rotation  angle  𝜙 = 2(𝜃1 + 𝜃2 + 𝜃3) .  This\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noperation is the combined effect of Zeeman energy difference and XY interaction. Benefiting from\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n𝜙𝑖 = 𝜋 ,  the  tilt  axis  angle  is  always  equal  to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n,  hence  an  exact  iSWAP  operation  can  always  be\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrealized. Due to the composite pulse scheme, now the two two-qubit operation angles can be modified\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nby changing  (𝜃1, 𝜃2, 𝜃3)  separately. Such a composite scheme is not limited to three segments. For\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe scenario in which each pulse segment realizes a  𝜋-rotation, the demonstrated composite two-qubit\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n𝑛\n𝜂 = 𝜋 ∑ sin(𝜃𝑛)\n𝑛=1,2,3⋯\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWithout loss of generality, here we focus on the three-segment scenario for simplicity. By adjusting\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe amplitude of each segment of the composite pulse, we can control  𝐽  and  ∆𝐸𝑍  in order to modify\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n𝜃1, 𝜃2, 𝜃3, which would in turn allow us to control the two two-qubit operations via their operation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nangles. Further control can be achieved via tunnel coupling  𝑡𝑐. Simulation results are given in Fig.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\n2(c). Assuming  𝜃1, 𝜃2 and 𝜃3  can be adjusted from 0 to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n(the maximum tunable region), we give\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nthe surfaces corresponding to  𝜂 = 𝑛𝜋  and  𝜙 =\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n. In Fig. 2(c), we also highlight the intersections\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\namong these surfaces and indicate the essential two-qubit gate operations represented by each crossing\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncurve. Interestingly, multiple types of essential two-qubit operations can be realized. For example, a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n, while a  √𝑖𝑆𝑊𝐴𝑃  is realized when  𝜂 = 2𝜋  and  𝜙 =\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWith  knowledge  of  the  dependencies  between  the  operations  (𝜂, 𝜙)   and  the  rotation  angles\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(𝜃1, 𝜃2, 𝜃3) ,  we  deduce  the  available  operation  angle  scale  and  the  corresponding  parameter\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrequirements.  Figure  3  gives  the  available  CPhase  operation  angle  as  a  function  of  the  iSWAP\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.4**r== 0.1**\n], we see that  𝜂  can be tuned continuously for more than  2𝜋,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhich indicates that the operation angles of these two types of two-qubit operations can be controlled\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncontinuously  and  separately. The  corresponding  lower  bound  of  the  required  rotation  angle  𝜃𝑙𝑏   is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\ngiven in Fig. 3 as well as the corresponding requirements on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nfor five types of essential two-qubit\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngates. Most of the  essential  two-qubit operations can be demonstrated directly in  the region  where\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n𝐽~∆𝐸𝑍, excluding the SWAP operation, which can be realized by combining a CPhase gate and an\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\niSWAP  gate.  In  addition  to  the  essential  two-qubit  gates,  while  maintaining  𝜂 = 2𝜋 ,  the  iSWAP-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfamily gates can be realized by changing  𝜃. The fSim gate set  14, 17 is also feasible because of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncontinuously tunable operation angle. The high degree of tunability and versatility of the composite\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npulse allows us to impose some constraints for convenience. Considering the symmetric effect of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfirst and third pulse segments, in the analysis below we make a reasonable simplification, maintaining\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\n𝜃1 = 𝜃3, as well as the amplitudes of the first and third segments are the same.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nExperimental Verification. To experimentally verify the composite gate scheme, we measure the final\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstate after implementing the composite operations on a two-qubit system. Specifically, the left qubit\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nQL  is read out and initialized directly with Elzerman readout (at point A in Fig. 1(c) insert), while the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nright  qubit  QR   is  read  out  indirectly  by  first  shuttling  the  electron  to  the  left  quantum  dot,  then\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nperforming Elzerman readout (at point B in Fig. 1(c) insert). Under an external magnetic field of  𝐵0 =\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n605 mT, we characterize  𝐽(𝜀), 𝛥𝐸(𝜀)  and  ΔEz(𝜀)  by measuring the DQD spectrum, as well as the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndependence  𝜃(𝜀)   for  a  single-segment  diabatic  pulse. With  a  given  𝜃(𝜀) ,  we  can  then  obtain  the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncomposition operation angle (𝜂, 𝜙) with the varied three-segment pulse amplitude (𝜀1, 𝜀2, 𝜀3), as given\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nin Fig. 4(a-b). The theoretically predicted  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩  is subsequently shown in Fig. 4(c) with the known\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn our experiments, after initializing the two qubits to the  |↑↓⟩  state, we apply a composite pulse with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\namplitudes (𝜀1, 𝜀2, 𝜀3), then read out the spin-up probability of  𝑄𝐿  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩. The measured  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩  as a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfunction of  𝜀1(𝜀3) and 𝜀2  is shown in Fig. 4(d), which agrees excellently with the simulated result.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis agreement verifies the validity of our composite operation scheme. For the pulse parameters on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe contour line  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩ = 0, the implemented composite pulse includes an iSWAP gate and a CPhase\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noperation with a nonzero rotation angle  𝜂. For the pulse parameters on the contour lines  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩ = 0.5,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe implemented composite pulse includes a  √𝑖𝑆𝑊𝐴𝑃  gate and a CPhase operation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn  our  device,  due  to  the  difference  between  the  g-factors,  𝛥𝐸𝑧   increases  with  increasing  𝐵0 .  To\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncharacterize  the  composite  gate  when  𝐽~𝛥𝐸𝑧 ,  we  increase  𝐵0   to  755 mT ,  where  the  variation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninterval of  𝛥𝐸𝑧(𝜀)  is 23~15 MHz and the variation interval of  𝐽(𝜀)  is 0~60 MHz. After calculate the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncomposition  operation  angle  (𝜂, 𝜙 )  with  the  varied  three-segment  pulse  amplitude  (𝜀1, 𝜀2, 𝜀3 )  (see\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSupplementary Note 2), we can simulate the measurement  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩  at  𝐵0 = 755 mT, as given in Fig.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n4(e). The corresponding experimental results are shown in Fig. 4(f). The great agreement between the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsimulated and experimental results indicates that the composite pulses can reliably perform desired\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\noperations, including flipping spin states far away from the    𝐽 ≫ 𝛥𝐸𝑧  region.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBased  on  this  composite  gate  framework,  further  dynamically  corrected  gates  with  better  noise\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresistance can potentially be developed  40-46. We believe that additional degrees of freedom, such as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe pulse duration of each segment and the number of pulse segments, still need to be theoretically and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nexperimentally researched. We expect that there exists a composite operation with a better extended\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nparameter  limitation  compared  to  the  basic  situation  in  our  scheme.  In  addition,  more  precise  and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncomprehensive  experimental  research  on  composite  gates  should  be  conducted.  Although,  in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSupplementary  Note  3,  the  theoretically  calculated  results  indicate  the  potential  of  high-fidelity\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncomposite gates, the quality of composite gate operation still needs to be evaluated experimentally,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand benchmarking methods such as unitary tomography 17 and XEB 47 can be favorable solutions. To\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimplement  the  composite  gate  in  a  large  qubit  array,  we  believe  that  feedback  and  device  stability\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimprovement are crucial, and a high circuit bandwidth and precise predistorted pulse are also necessary.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe suppose that the state-of-the-art techniques 48-52 have been suitable for these requirements. With\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthis composite operation scheme, we believe that the NISQ era will be accelerated, benefiting from its\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn summary, we propose and verify an extremely versatile composite two-qubit gate scheme for spin\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nqubits  coupled  via  the  Heisenberg  exchange  interaction.  By  controlling  the  amplitude  of  the  three\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsegments, we can realize all the important two-qubit gates, including SWAP, iSWAP, CPhase, and fSim\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ngates, even in  the presence of  a finite Zeeman energy difference  ∆𝐸𝑍  between the two qubits. We\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nhave experimentally verified the scheme in the region  𝐽~𝛥𝐸𝑍  on a purified Si-MOS DQD device.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWith greatly enhanced two-qubit operation flexibility, reduced parameter limitations, and increased\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\noperation  speed,  the  diverse  set  of  two-qubit  gates  enabled  by  our  composite  two-qubit  scheme  is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npotentially extensively utilized for realizing quantum algorithms with limited hardware and physical\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresources.

         " A diverse set of two-qubit gates   for spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots   To realize large-scale quantum information processes, an ideal scheme for two-qubit operations   should enable diverse operations with given  hardware and physical interaction.  However, for   spin  qubits  in  semiconductor  quantum  dots,  the  common  two-qubit  operations,  including   CPhase gates, SWAP gates, and CROT gates, are realized with distinct parameter regions and   control  waveforms,  posing  challenges  for  their  simultaneous  implementation.  Here,  taking   advantage of the inherent Heisenberg interaction between spin qubits, we propose and verify a   fast  composite  two-qubit  gate  scheme  to  extend  the  available  two-qubit  gate  types  as  well  as   reduce  the  requirements  for  device  properties.  Apart  from  the  formerly  proposed  CPhase   (controlled-phase) gates and SWAP gates, theoretical results indicate that the iSWAP-family gate   and Fermionic simulation (fSim) gate set are additionally available for spin qubits. Meanwhile,   our gate scheme limits the parameter requirements of all essential two-qubit gates to a common   𝑱~𝜟𝑬𝒁   region,  facilitate  the  simultaneous  realization  of  them.  Furthermore,  we  present  the   preliminary  experimental  demonstration  of  the  composite  gate  scheme,  observing  excellent   match between the measured and simulated results. With this versatile composite gate scheme,   broad-spectrum  two-qubit  operations  allow  us  to  efficiently  utilize  the  hardware  and  the   underlying physics resources, helping accelerate and broaden the scope of the upcoming noise   The study of quantum computing  has experienced tremendous progress  over the past  two decades,   such that a variety  of qubit platforms, from  superconducting qubits and trapped ion  qubits, to  spin   qubits in silicon more recently, are now in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime 1-10.   As  quantum  circuits  grow  in  size,  developing  optimal  quantum  gate  sets  is  emerging  as  a  major   A minimal gate set for universal quantum computing consists of arbitrary single-qubit rotations and a   single  two-qubit  entangling  gate  11. Availability  of  a  larger  variety  of  two-qubit  gates  could  help   improve the quantum circuit depth and ensure that the hardware resources are utilized more efficiently   12,  13.  Furthermore,  specially  designed  quantum  simulations  14,  algorithms  15  and  error  mitigation   techniques  16  may  be  implemented  more  efficiently  using  specific  gates  such  as  the  Fermionic   simulation (fSim) gate set 14, 17. On the other hand, while a given physical interaction may be used to   generate any two-qubit gate, each two-qubit gate has a native interaction that can generate it efficiently,   essentially by just turning on the interaction for a certain period of time. For example, a controlled   phase shift (CPHASE gate) can be generated via Ising interaction; a controlled rotation (CROT) via   Ising interaction and a selected ESR/EDSR pulse; a SWAP gate (or  √SWAP) via Heisenberg exchange;   and an iSWAP gate via XY interaction. In other words, given a particular physical interaction in a qubit   system, usually one specific two-qubit entangling gate can be generated efficiently, while any other   two-qubit gate would have to be obtained via a more complicated pulse sequence, making these gates   Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs, especially in Si and Ge), are one of the promising   platforms for quantum computing, and are now in the early NISQ era 7-10, 22-24. The native interaction   for spin qubits is the Heisenberg exchange interaction,  𝐽𝑆⃗1 ∙ 𝑆⃗2, which generates SWAP (exchanging   the states of two qubits) and  √SWAP  gates efficiently if the two qubits are in resonance 25-27, with the   former allowing on-chip qubit transportation  28, while a pair of the latter together with single-qubit   gates leading to a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate 18. However, since single-spin operations are usually   based on a magnetic field gradient produced by an on-chip micromagnet 29, 30, two neighboring spins   are  often  off  resonance  by  design,  making  SWAP  gates  much  more  difficult  to  generate,  requiring   reliable  and  precise  diabatic  tuning  of  exchange  coupling  𝐽   and  Zeeman  energy  difference  ∆𝐸𝑍   between the two qubits 26, 27. Instead, CPHASE and CROT gates 31-33 are the main entangling gates for   current generation spin qubits. Furthermore, iSWAP gate family has not been demonstrated for spin   qubits at all. How to diversify the two-qubit gate set under the given constraints (exchange interaction   together with magnetic field gradient) remains an intriguing open question for spin qubits.   We propose and verify a diabatic composite two-qubit scheme to implement a diverse set of two-qubit   gates, including five types of essential two-qubit gates, iSWAP-family gates, and the fSim gate set,   with reduced device properties requirements. We extend the basic diabatic two-qubit operations theory   to the composition scenario, and propose our diabatic composite gate scheme. The simulation results   show that the composite gate can separately tune the CPhase operation angle and iSWAP operation   angle,  thus  facilitating  the  realization  of  diverse  two-qubit  operations.  We  calculate  the  maximum   𝐽/𝛥𝐸𝑍  required for five types of essential two-qubit gates, observe that the parameter requirements of   them fall within a common 𝐽~𝛥𝐸𝑍  region. In experiments, we present the preliminary experimental   demonstration of the composite gate scheme in a purified Si-MOS double quantum dots (DQD) device.   Comparing  the  measured  results  to  the  theoretically  predicted  ones,  excellent  match  between  them   verifies that our composite two-qubit gate scheme can simultaneously enabled a diverse set of two-   Diabatic Two-qubit Operation. A schematic diagram of our two-qubit device is shown in Fig. 1(a),   which is identical to that reported in previous works  26, 34, 35. A two-qubit gate can be performed by   adjusting the tunnel coupling  𝑡𝑐  and/or detuning  ε36. When a diabatic pulse is applied to modify  𝜀,   turning on the exchange interaction between the two qubits, the two-qubit gate operator in the two-   spin basis of  (|↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩)𝑇  can be written as (see Supplementary Note 1 for detail)   where  𝛾𝐿   and  𝛾𝑅   are  single-qubit  local  phases,  which  we  do  not  focus  on  in  this  work.  The   Heisenberg exchange interaction contains both an Ising interaction term and an XY interaction term.   Combined with the Zeeman energy difference between qubits, the diabatic pulse executes a two-qubit   gate that can be decomposed into two parts: One is a CPhase operation due to the Ising interaction,   with a rotating angle  𝜂0 = 𝐽𝑡, where  𝑡  is the duration of the diabatic pulse 33. The other part, as shown   in Fig. 1(b), is a rotation operation in the subspace of the antiparallel states, produced by the combined   effect  of  XY  interaction  and  the  non-zero  ∆𝐸𝑍 .  This  operation  introduces  a  rotation  with  an   accumulated phase of  𝜙0 = 𝛥𝐸𝑡  around a tilted axis  with  𝜃0 = arctan (   )  37, where  𝛥𝐸  is  the   energy difference between the antiparallel states  |↑↓̃ ⟩  and  |↓↑̃ ⟩.   Figure  1(c)  shows  𝐽, 𝛥𝐸   and  𝛥𝐸𝑧   at  different  𝜀 ,  and  Fig.  1(d)  gives  the  corresponding  three   operation  angles  𝜙0, 𝜃0, and 𝜂0 . With  increasing  𝜀 ,  𝐽   increases  while  𝛥𝐸𝑧   decreases  due  to  the   Stark shift 38, 39. Here we define  𝜀 = 0    at the symmetric operation point (point C in Fig. 1(c) insert)   36 and positive  𝜀  corresponds to higher energy for  QR. We calculate  𝜂0  and  𝜃0  while guaranteeing   the operation duration  𝜏𝑠  making  𝜙0 = 𝜋  at different  𝜀. With  𝜀  increases,  𝜃0  and  𝜂0  increase as   well,  while  𝜂0   will  gradually  converge  to  𝜙0 ,  due  to  the  approached  𝐽   and  𝛥𝐸 . At  the  detuning   ,  a  diabatic  CZ  gate  can  be  realized  since  𝜂0 = 𝐽𝑡 = 𝜋   and  𝜙0 = 2𝜋   will   occur simultaneously, during which only the Ising interaction part remained. At the regime  𝐽 ≫ 𝛥𝐸𝑧,   a  CPhase  operation  with  𝜂0 = 𝜋 ,  and  an  iSWAP  operation  with  𝜙0 = 𝜋, 𝜃0 =   are  realized   simultaneously  here.  The  two  parts  of  two-qubit  operations  introduced  by  the  native  exchange   Although a single-segment diabatic pulse can implement a two-qubit CPhase gate or a SWAP gate,   . When this parameter requirement cannot be   satisfied, the iSWAP operation and the CPhase operation are always implemented simultaneously and   inevitably mixed, thus the combined two-qubit operation will not be any of the essential two-qubit   gates. And this final gate operation is the results of mixed effect of the Zeeman energy difference, plus   Ising interaction and XY interaction in the native exchange interaction. Although we know the speed   of these two operations accurately, we are still limited by the need to adjust the operation angles, since   we cannot control their relative rates effectively and separately. If the operation angles of the iSWAP   operation and the CPhase operation can be controlled separately, a diverse set of combined two-qubit   gates will be available, and the exchange interaction between the spins can be sufficiently utilized.   Composite Gate Scheme. To overcome the difficulties associated with a single-segment diabatic pulse,   we introduce a versatile gate implemented by a three-segment composite pulse, which can separately   control the operation angle of the CPhase operation and iSWAP operation. As shown in Fig. 2(a), for   a  composite  pulse  composed  of  three  continuous  diabatic  square  pulses,  we  adjust  𝜂𝑖   and  𝜃𝑖   by   changing the amplitude of each segment as well as having each segment implementing an operation   with  𝜙𝑖 = 𝜋   by  changing  the  pulse  durations.  The  total  operator  of  this  composite  pulse  (see   Supplementary Note 1 for a detailed theoretical derivation) takes the form   where the indices denote the three segments, and  𝛾𝐿  and  𝛾𝑅  are the single-qubit local phases of the   two qubits. Analogous to the single-segment diabatic pulse, the three-segment pulse also consists of   three components, including a single-qubit rotation, a two-qubit CPhase operation, and a rotation in   the  two-qubit  subspace  always  with  𝜃 =   .  In  this  paper,  we  will  focus  on  the  two-qubit  gate   operations. Figure 2(b) shows the evolution trajectory of the qubit states while applying a composite   pulse.  Specifically,  the  CPhase  operation  angle  𝜂 = [sin(𝜃1) + sin(𝜃2) + sin(𝜃3)]𝜋    is  the   superposition of the CPhase operations of each segment, as the consequence of the Ising component   of the exchange interaction. In addition, the superposition of the rotation operations in the two-qubit   subspace  leads  to  a  two-qubit  iSWAP  operation  with  a  rotation  angle  𝜙 = 2(𝜃1 + 𝜃2 + 𝜃3) .  This   operation is the combined effect of Zeeman energy difference and XY interaction. Benefiting from   𝜙𝑖 = 𝜋 ,  the  tilt  axis  angle  is  always  equal  to   ,  hence  an  exact  iSWAP  operation  can  always  be   realized. Due to the composite pulse scheme, now the two two-qubit operation angles can be modified   by changing  (𝜃1, 𝜃2, 𝜃3)  separately. Such a composite scheme is not limited to three segments. For   the scenario in which each pulse segment realizes a  𝜋-rotation, the demonstrated composite two-qubit   Without loss of generality, here we focus on the three-segment scenario for simplicity. By adjusting   the amplitude of each segment of the composite pulse, we can control  𝐽  and  ∆𝐸𝑍  in order to modify   𝜃1, 𝜃2, 𝜃3, which would in turn allow us to control the two two-qubit operations via their operation   angles. Further control can be achieved via tunnel coupling  𝑡𝑐. Simulation results are given in Fig.   2(c). Assuming  𝜃1, 𝜃2 and 𝜃3  can be adjusted from 0 to   (the maximum tunable region), we give   the surfaces corresponding to  𝜂 = 𝑛𝜋  and  𝜙 =   . In Fig. 2(c), we also highlight the intersections   among these surfaces and indicate the essential two-qubit gate operations represented by each crossing   curve. Interestingly, multiple types of essential two-qubit operations can be realized. For example, a   , while a  √𝑖𝑆𝑊𝐴𝑃  is realized when  𝜂 = 2𝜋  and  𝜙 =   With  knowledge  of  the  dependencies  between  the  operations  (𝜂, 𝜙)   and  the  rotation  angles   (𝜃1, 𝜃2, 𝜃3) ,  we  deduce  the  available  operation  angle  scale  and  the  corresponding  parameter   requirements.  Figure  3  gives  the  available  CPhase  operation  angle  as  a  function  of  the  iSWAP   ], we see that  𝜂  can be tuned continuously for more than  2𝜋,   which indicates that the operation angles of these two types of two-qubit operations can be controlled   continuously  and  separately. The  corresponding  lower  bound  of  the  required  rotation  angle  𝜃𝑙𝑏   is   given in Fig. 3 as well as the corresponding requirements on   for five types of essential two-qubit   gates. Most of the  essential  two-qubit operations can be demonstrated directly in  the region  where   𝐽~∆𝐸𝑍, excluding the SWAP operation, which can be realized by combining a CPhase gate and an   iSWAP  gate.  In  addition  to  the  essential  two-qubit  gates,  while  maintaining  𝜂 = 2𝜋 ,  the  iSWAP-   family gates can be realized by changing  𝜃. The fSim gate set  14, 17 is also feasible because of the   continuously tunable operation angle. The high degree of tunability and versatility of the composite   pulse allows us to impose some constraints for convenience. Considering the symmetric effect of the   first and third pulse segments, in the analysis below we make a reasonable simplification, maintaining   𝜃1 = 𝜃3, as well as the amplitudes of the first and third segments are the same.   Experimental Verification. To experimentally verify the composite gate scheme, we measure the final   state after implementing the composite operations on a two-qubit system. Specifically, the left qubit   QL  is read out and initialized directly with Elzerman readout (at point A in Fig. 1(c) insert), while the   right  qubit  QR   is  read  out  indirectly  by  first  shuttling  the  electron  to  the  left  quantum  dot,  then   performing Elzerman readout (at point B in Fig. 1(c) insert). Under an external magnetic field of  𝐵0 =   605 mT, we characterize  𝐽(𝜀), 𝛥𝐸(𝜀)  and  ΔEz(𝜀)  by measuring the DQD spectrum, as well as the   dependence  𝜃(𝜀)   for  a  single-segment  diabatic  pulse. With  a  given  𝜃(𝜀) ,  we  can  then  obtain  the   composition operation angle (𝜂, 𝜙) with the varied three-segment pulse amplitude (𝜀1, 𝜀2, 𝜀3), as given   in Fig. 4(a-b). The theoretically predicted  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩  is subsequently shown in Fig. 4(c) with the known   In our experiments, after initializing the two qubits to the  |↑↓⟩  state, we apply a composite pulse with   amplitudes (𝜀1, 𝜀2, 𝜀3), then read out the spin-up probability of  𝑄𝐿  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩. The measured  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩  as a   function of  𝜀1(𝜀3) and 𝜀2  is shown in Fig. 4(d), which agrees excellently with the simulated result.   This agreement verifies the validity of our composite operation scheme. For the pulse parameters on   the contour line  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩ = 0, the implemented composite pulse includes an iSWAP gate and a CPhase   operation with a nonzero rotation angle  𝜂. For the pulse parameters on the contour lines  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩ = 0.5,   the implemented composite pulse includes a  √𝑖𝑆𝑊𝐴𝑃  gate and a CPhase operation.   In  our  device,  due  to  the  difference  between  the  g-factors,  𝛥𝐸𝑧   increases  with  increasing  𝐵0 .  To   characterize  the  composite  gate  when  𝐽~𝛥𝐸𝑧 ,  we  increase  𝐵0   to  755 mT ,  where  the  variation   interval of  𝛥𝐸𝑧(𝜀)  is 23~15 MHz and the variation interval of  𝐽(𝜀)  is 0~60 MHz. After calculate the   composition  operation  angle  (𝜂, 𝜙 )  with  the  varied  three-segment  pulse  amplitude  (𝜀1, 𝜀2, 𝜀3 )  (see   Supplementary Note 2), we can simulate the measurement  𝑃𝐿,|↑⟩  at  𝐵0 = 755 mT, as given in Fig.   4(e). The corresponding experimental results are shown in Fig. 4(f). The great agreement between the   simulated and experimental results indicates that the composite pulses can reliably perform desired   operations, including flipping spin states far away from the    𝐽 ≫ 𝛥𝐸𝑧  region.   Based  on  this  composite  gate  framework,  further  dynamically  corrected  gates  with  better  noise   resistance can potentially be developed  40-46. We believe that additional degrees of freedom, such as   the pulse duration of each segment and the number of pulse segments, still need to be theoretically and   experimentally researched. We expect that there exists a composite operation with a better extended   parameter  limitation  compared  to  the  basic  situation  in  our  scheme.  In  addition,  more  precise  and   comprehensive  experimental  research  on  composite  gates  should  be  conducted.  Although,  in   Supplementary  Note  3,  the  theoretically  calculated  results  indicate  the  potential  of  high-fidelity   composite gates, the quality of composite gate operation still needs to be evaluated experimentally,   and benchmarking methods such as unitary tomography 17 and XEB 47 can be favorable solutions. To   implement  the  composite  gate  in  a  large  qubit  array,  we  believe  that  feedback  and  device  stability   improvement are crucial, and a high circuit bandwidth and precise predistorted pulse are also necessary.   We suppose that the state-of-the-art techniques 48-52 have been suitable for these requirements. With   this composite operation scheme, we believe that the NISQ era will be accelerated, benefiting from its   In summary, we propose and verify an extremely versatile composite two-qubit gate scheme for spin   qubits  coupled  via  the  Heisenberg  exchange  interaction.  By  controlling  the  amplitude  of  the  three   segments, we can realize all the important two-qubit gates, including SWAP, iSWAP, CPhase, and fSim   gates, even in  the presence of  a finite Zeeman energy difference  ∆𝐸𝑍  between the two qubits. We   have experimentally verified the scheme in the region  𝐽~𝛥𝐸𝑍  on a purified Si-MOS DQD device.   With greatly enhanced two-qubit operation flexibility, reduced parameter limitations, and increased   operation  speed,  the  diverse  set  of  two-qubit  gates  enabled  by  our  composite  two-qubit  scheme  is   potentially extensively utilized for realizing quantum algorithms with limited hardware and physical   resources. In the future, device structure design and quantum circuit compilations can be simplified,   and a wide variety of quantum algorithms and quantum simulations based on these composite gates   Our device is fabricated based on a 70 nm 28Si epilayer with a residual 29Si concentration of 60 ppm.   As shown in Fig. 1(a), the two qubits  𝑄𝐿  and  𝑄𝑅  are located underneath the two plunger gates PL   and PR, respectively. The charge occupancy is measured by the SET conductance, which capacitive   couples with the DQD. A Ti/Co/Ti rectangular magnet is fabricated beside the quantum dots to provide   the gradient magnetic field to drive the single-qubit oscillation with EDSR.   We performed the experiments in an Oxford Triton dilution refrigerator at a base temperature of 20   mK. After I/Q modulation, two microwaves from the output of the vector microwave source E8267D   are generated to drive the single-qubit rotation. Two pulses channels of arbitrary waveform generator   Tektronix 5208 are utilized to exert the diabatic composite pulses. The microwaves and the diabatic   pulses  are  combined  together  at  room  temperature  and  exerted  on  the  plunger  gates  through  high-   bandwidth  control  line.  The  initialization  and  readout  pulses  are  generated  by  arbitrary  waveform   generator Tektronix  5204, combined with  the DC voltage at  room temperature, and exerted on the   plunger gates through the low-frequency control line. The read out SET current,  after converted to   voltage through the IV converter DLPCA-200, is then filtered and amplified at room temperature and   All the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon   We acknowledge Chengxian Zhang for helpful discussions of theoretical derivation.

         "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) energy trading based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT), such as blockchains, has attracted much attention due to its promising features, including ease of deployment, decentralization, transparency, and security. However, existing DLT-based models do not support microtransactions due to the low value of such transactions relative to the incentives offered to transaction verifiers. To address this issue, we propose an IOTA DLT-based efficient and secure energy trading model for V2G networks, where electric vehicles (EVs) and grids negotiate energy prices in an off-chain manner. The proposed model utilizes a privacy-preserving protocol to prevent real-time tracking of EV locations. We develop a Stackelberg game model to represent the interactions between the EVs and grids, from which we derive a pricing scheme and propose a deposit mechanism to prevent fake energy trading between the EVs and grids. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms existing V2G energy trading mechanisms regarding transaction efficiency, provides enhanced EV privacy, and improves resilience against fake energy trading. Offering robust computational performance and addressing computational complexity (time, space, and message), our model presents a comprehensive V2G energy trading solution, balancing efficiency, security, and privacy.",

However,\nexisting DLT-based models do not support microtransactions due to the low value of such transactions relative to the incentives offered to\ntransaction verifiers. To address this issue, we propose an IOTA DLT-based efficient and secure energy trading model for V2G networks,\nwhere electric vehicles (EVs) and grids negotiate energy prices in an off-chain manner. The proposed model utilizes a privacy-preserving\nprotocol to prevent real-time tracking of EV locations. We develop a Stackelberg game model to represent the interactions between the\nEVs and grids, from which we derive a pricing scheme and propose a deposit mechanism to prevent fake energy trading between the\nEVs and grids. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms existing V2G energy trading mechanisms\nregarding transaction efficiency, provides enhanced EV privacy, and improves resilience against fake energy trading.Offering robust\ncomputational performance and addressing computational complexity (time, space, and message), our model presents a comprehensive\nV2G energy trading solution, balancing efficiency, security, and privacy.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nIndex Terms—Blockchain, game theory, IOTA, privacy, resource management, security, smart grid\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.8**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\n1 INTRODUCTION\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nE Lectric Vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n(RES) play an important role in sustainable energy and\nreducing the adverse impacts of fossil fuels, hence attracting\nincreasing attention from both academia and industry in re-\ncent years.

In [10], the\nauthors proposed a privacy-preserving, automated, reliable\nblockchain-based protocol to select the optimum charging\nstations based on the distance from EVs and energy price.\nAlthough the protocol achieves a relatively small overhead,\nit does not prevent possible dishonest behavior by EVs\nin negotiations. In [11], the authors proposed a Bayesian\ngame-based scheme for energy trading in V2V. The result\nshows that user satisfaction in the proposed scheme reaches\n98% with incomplete information. However, the proposed\nscheme has poor runtime performance because all pro-\ncesses run as blockchain transactions. In [12], the authors\ndesigned the architecture of a decentralized power trading\nsystem of EVs, which is consortium blockchain-based. The\nproposed scheme’s security evaluation showed that it is\nresilient against different types of attacks. However, the\nmodel did not consider the uncertainty about the range\nof the discharging vehicles. In [13], the authors proposed a\nfog computing-based architecture for energy trading. Their\nevaluation demonstrated that the genetic algorithm achieves\nmaximum social welfare, which is 71.03% more than the\nLagrange algorithm.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHowever, performance suffers because all the auction\nprocesses run as a blockchain transaction. In [14], the au-\nthors designed a system called FeneChain for decentral-\nized energy trading. The results showed that FeneChain\nperforms better than the other three schemes regarding\nenergy sales and energy purchase computational costs.\nHowever, the authors did not consider fairness. In [15], the\nauthors proposed a blockchain-based differential auction of\nprivate energy for microgrids. They showed that the pro-\nposed mechanism performs better than other mechanisms\nfor auctions. However, no incentive was provided in the\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nauction process to guide energy suppliers/buyers. In [16],\nthe authors leveraged blockchain technology to develop a\nP2P secure energy trading system. They showed that the\nproposed scheme’s benefits increase when the number of\nEVs in the network increases. In [17], the authors pro-\nposed a framework for secure energy trading based on\na consortium blockchain. Although the scheme performs\nwell in maximizing social welfare, it is rather compute-\nintensive, prohibiting widespread deployment. In [5], the\nauthors proposed a consortium blockchain-based frame-\nwork of V2G energy trading, which is efficient and secure\nfor cyber-physical systems. They showed that the proposed\nframework is promising in terms of provided security, the\nperformance of task offloading, and contract feasibility.\nHowever, the local energy aggregators cannot purchase the\nlarger services when the transaction fee is low. In [18], a\nblockchain-based privacy-preserving network of incentive\nannouncements was proposed. See Supplementary Table\nfor details. The authors compared the proposed protocol\nwith others and showed that it is more efficient. However,\nblockchain’s high computation resource requirements pre-\nvent incentive announcements from being widely deployed.\nIn [19], a blockchain-based real-time system that uses a cryp-\ntocurrency and a prioritization concept called SMERCOIN\nto incentivize EVs to charge in a renewable energy-friendly\nschedule was proposed.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe evaluation results showed that the local consump-\ntion rate increased to 37%, decreasing the aggregator’s\nenergy cost. However, the work only focused on renew-\nable energy consumption rates and did not consider EV\nprivacy. More recent work by Zhang et al. [20], Sharma et\nal. [21] and Liang et al. [22] have also proposed blockchain-\nbased approaches for V2G energy trading, but they carry\nthe same disadvantages as other blockchain-based models.\nIn [1], the authors proposed a Directed Acyclic Graph-\nbased lightweight protocol for V2G (DV2G). The proposed\nmodel’s evaluation showed that it supports microtransac-\ntions and is highly scalable. However, it did not consider EV\nprivacy. In [6], the authors proposed a distributed network\nof charging stations for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\nbased on IOTA. They showed that the proposed scheme\nprovides better revenue and utility for charging stations and\nUAVs than traditional blockchain-based schemes. In [7], the\nauthors proposed a blockchain-based system of Internet of\nVehicles (IoV) data trading, which uses a debit-credit mech-\nanism using a two-stage Stackelberg game. The scheme\nis limited to data trading and does not focus on energy\ntransactions. In [23], The authors introduced a blockchain-\nbased spectrum trading platform for UAV cellular networks,\ndemonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness in enhancing\nprivacy and security. However, the proposed scheme lacks\nspecific strategies to prevent malicious providers and buy-\ners.\n**BLOCK**fs== 11.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n3 IOTA DLT OVERVIEW\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIOTA is an open-source DLT designed specifically for the In-\nternet of Things.

The energy trading benefit in a V2G\nnetwork is maximized by maximizing the revenue of grids\n(buyers) and EVs (sellers).

The basic privacy requirements for this\nprotocol are as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n1) LocationPrivacy: No participant can determine the ex-\nact positions of EVs in real time. This ensures that the\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nFigure 1: IOTA-based V2G network energy trading process\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nlocation privacy of EVs is protected, preventing any po-\ntential tracking or profiling based on their movements.\n2) SchedulePrivacy: The privacy of EVs and their charg-\nthe\ning schedules must be maintained throughout\ncharging process. This safeguards the confidentiality of\ntheir charging patterns, which could otherwise reveal\nsensitive information about EV owners’ habits and rou-\ntines.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the DLT, each participant (i.e., the EV or grid) uses\nthe system-provided unique anonymous ID ζ. The map-\nping between the participant’s ID and its true identity is\nknown only to the system. Hence, the true identity of each\nparticipant is unknown to other participants. Nevertheless,\ndeanonymization of participants is possible by relating keys\nand transactions [26]. The ID ζ changes for every request\nto mitigate the deanonymization problem by creating a new\npair of keys to enhance EVs’ privacy. We assume that the\ngrid list and positions are known publicly. Figure 1 shows an\noverview of the V2G energy trading process. The protocol\nconsists of four phases, as described below.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n4.3.1 Bidding phase\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the bidding phase, EVs place the ESO with a unique\nidentity to the grid in an immutable and public way with\na deposit. The ESO’s public nature incentivizes other dis-\ncharging EVs to keep their prices competitive. The ESOs\ncontain the energy amount e ∈ Q+, at time slot t ∈ T ,\ngeographic region r ∈ R, and selling price p. The region\nshould be chosen broadly so that the privacy of EVs is\nprotected but within EVs’ feasible range. No one participant\nfinds out anything beyond ESO(e, t, r, p,) and the ID ζ.\nGiven (e, t, r, p,), no participant can determine the exact\nlocations of EVs because the different ESOs are disconnected\nfrom others. The selling offers cannot be directly related to\nthe specific discharging vehicle because only the ID ζ of\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\ndischarging EVs is shown with the ESO (without identifying\nthe exact position of the EV). Once the ESOs are submitted to\nthe ledger, they are visible to all the grids and all discharging\nEVs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n4.3.2 Evaluation phase\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn the evaluation phase, the grids assess the discharging\nEVs’ ESOs based on their distance, energy supply, and price.\nThe grid finds the optimum discharging EVs according to\nthe total energy price. In the case of many demands from\nthe grids to discharge EVs, the EVs select among them\nuniformly. EVs use a non-cooperative game (NCG) strategy\nto update their prices to enhance their selection probability.\nGrids privately decide on the bid in an off-IOTA manner.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n4.3.3 Negotiation phase\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn the negotiation phase, the grid communicates with dis-\ncharging EVs to set the energy price off-IOTA. When both\nagree on the price, then the agreed transaction is submitted\nto the IOTA ledger. The ESO of discharging EVs contain\n(e, t, r, p), and the grids i check their positions and other pa-\nrameters discussed in the evaluation phase to find appropri-\nate discharging EVs. When appropriate discharging EVs are\nfound, grids create their bids based on NCG bi = f (e, t, p).\nThis function shows that grid i desires to purchase energy e\nfrom EV ζ in the given time slot for bi ≤ bj, j = 1, ..., N . If\nthe discharging EV agrees on the given grid’s bid bi, then the\ntransaction is written in the IOTA ledger. The negotiation\nprocess continues until price convergence or a set time limit.\nThe grid may accept EV bids immediately or update prices.\nUpon agreement, the final price is determined. Once the\nEV and grid have agreed on the appropriate price, the grid\nbinds the commitment computationally c = H(ζ,¯i, rn) by\ncombining the index of grid i and ID of EV ζ and freshly\ncreating a random number for it. The binding commitment\nis sent to the IOTA ledger.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\n4.3.4 Charging phase\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe transaction is executed directly between the grid and\nEV in the charging phase. The phase opens the commitment\nby sending ζ, ¯i, and rn to verify the selected grid. The\ngrid checks the commitment and verifies H(ζ,¯i, rn) = c\nand verifies whether the time of the transaction matches the\ncommitment time. Energy e is exchanged on commitment\nprice bi in the given time slot t. This commitment transaction\nis only performed between the selected grid and EV. The\ndischarging EV’s actual position is shown to the selected\ngrid at this stage. However, this commitment information\nis not shown to the IOTA network. In the process of open\ncommitment, EV reveals the ID ζ, and no other EV has the\nsame identity due to using a cryptographic hash function\nfor the commitment binding. As such, the grid proves that\nit communicates with the valid discharging EVs. After the\ncharging phase is complete, a new ID is assigned to each\ndischarging EV.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n5 GAME MODEL OF THE V2G NETWORK\nThis section presents the hierarchical game model governing\nenergy trading dynamics in the V2G system. EVs act as\nsellers, while smart grids serve as buyers. The hierarchy\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nstarts with a non-cooperative game (NCG), representing\nEVs competing to sell power at optimal prices to the grid.\nEVs equipped with solar panels negotiate with smart grids\nthroughout the day. EVs strategically adjust their selling\nprices based on energy generation and battery levels, while\ngrids dynamically adjust purchase prices based on predicted\nconsumption patterns. Next, a Stackelberg game (SG) cap-\ntures the interaction between EVs and grids. Here, EVs\nalternate between leading and following roles, influencing\nmarket dynamics with surplus energy. For instance, an EV\nmay lead by strategically withholding energy during peak\ndemand, prompting grids to offer better purchase terms.\nFinally, another NCG governs grid interactions, with oper-\nators adapting strategies to optimize profit while ensuring\nenergy supply meets demand.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n5.1 EVs employ NCG to make more profit\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe EVs employ NCG because they compete in a non-\ncooperative way with each other to make more profit by\nselling energy at the best price to the grid. When the grid’s\ndemand is greater than or equal to EV i’s supply, EV i’s\nutility is calculated by\nui(Et\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.7**r== 0.3**\ni,sell, ¯ωt\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.8**r== 0.2**\ni,sell ¯ωt\ni.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWhen the grid’s demand is less than the supply, EV i’s utility\nis calculated by\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.7**r== 0.3**\ni,sell, ¯ωt\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.8**r== 0.2**\ni,buy ¯ωt\ni.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nNash equilibrium is a notion in game theory that identifies\nthe best solution in an NGC, where participants have no\nincentive to change their initial approach. Under the Nash\nEquilibrium, a player gains nothing by departing from their\ninitial plan, assuming the other players’ strategies remain\nunchanged. There may be several Nash equilibria in a game\nor none at all.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe Nash equilibrium is attained when each EV sells\nits total surplus energy, which is the goal of the proposed\nalgorithm. A predefined set of conditions is in place to\nachieve this equilibrium point in NCG. One necessary con-\ndition is that a finite number of players must be satisfied by\nhaving X EVs participating. The game continues until the\ngrid demand, denoted as Ψt\ny,buy is fully satisfied or all the\nsurplus energy from the discharging EVs has been sold. The\nalgorithm facilitates this equilibrium by allowing each EV\nto decide how much extra energy to deal with, optimizing\ntheir utility or profit. The surplus energy is then allocated\nto the grid, ensuring demand is met while respecting the\nindividual decisions of the EVs. The algorithm checks if no\nEV can unilaterally change its decision to increase its profit,\nindicating the achievement of Nash equilibrium. The game\nterminates when the grid demand is met, or all surplus\nenergy is sold, representing a stable equilibrium state. A\ndischarging EV i uses the following strategy to adjust its\nsupply to maximize its selection probability\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.7**r== 0.3**\ny,buy–Et\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nA discharging EV i uses the following strategy to update its\nprices to maximize selection probability\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nwhere n represents the number of iterations. The NCG game\nis defined by the tuple Γ = ⟨X t, Ωt, pt, ⟨Ai, ui, T t\ni ⟩i∈N ⟩,\nwhere X t represents the set of EVs at time slot t, s.t. xt ∈ X t,\nΩt represents the condition of the weather at time slot t,\nAt\ni ) is the set of actions available for EV i at time\nslot t, where At\nN , Ti is the set of types\nfor EV i according to the condition of the weather or the\ncurrent state of the EV. Given the condition of the weather,\nthe type of EV i is given by the function τi : Ω → Ti [27].\nTherefore, according to the weather condition, the game\nwill have different types of EVs. The payoff function for\nEV i is defined by ui : Ti × A → R, and p is the probability\ndistribution for the weather condition Ω. A mixed strategy\nfor EVs i is a function xi : Ti → ∆Ai, where ∆Ai is the set\nof all probability distributions on Ai. Note that a strategy\ndepends only on its type of EVs. A strategy profile x\nrepresents the strategy for each EV. The strategy profile finds\nout the expected payoffs for each EV, where the expectation\nis taken based on both the weather condition and EV types\nin terms of beliefs p, and the randomization over actions\nimplied by any mixed strategies in the profile x.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nGiven a game ⟨N t, (Ai)i∈N , (ui)i∈N ⟩, the profile of the\nmixed strategy (xi)i∈N is called the Nash equilibrium of the\nmixed strategy if ∀i ∈ N\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nui(xi, x−i) ≥ ui(x′\nxi,sell and St\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nxj ,sell and St\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nxi,price be the supply and enforced\nprice of EV i at time slot t with choosing probabilities\nxi1 and xi2.

Besides, when the player\nuses the same choices every time, then other players will\ntrack these choices. This will create a privacy problem for\nEVs and also create the problem of using these choices to\nmaximize its selection probability at time slot t.

Enhances the Stackelberg game method for en-\nergy trading by introducing novel features like microtrans-\nactions and optimized decision-making. Leveraging IOTA’s\nplatform ensures secure, decentralized trading focusing on\ndata privacy. These innovations demonstrate the originality\nand significance of our work in advancing energy trading\nmethodologies. In the SG, EVs declare their available energy\nand price range for the specific time slot, and grids use the\nNCG to select a suitable EV. EVs use NCG to maximize\ntheir selection probability to update prices and adjust their\nsupply according to demand based on the NCG output. EVs\nuse NCG because they are unfamiliar with each other. The\ndouble auction algorithm achieves the Nash equilibrium in\nSG. The EVs update their prices by using the strategy in\n(18). The EVs adjust their supply utilizing the strategy in\n(17), and the grids use the NCG to select the best discharging\nEV. The energy price is the input for EVs’ NCG and grids’\nNCG. The EVs’ NCG output is the best-selling energy price,\nwhich is further used as input for the grids’ NCG, and the\ngrids’ NCG output is the best discharging EV selection. The\nSG establishes a connection between EVs’ NCG and grids’\nNCG. EVs use the best energy supply and its price according\nto (24c) and (25) to maximize their selection probability at\ntime slot t with suitable gain. Grids use (50c) and (50b) to\nselect the best suitable EV at time slot t with appropriate\ngain.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe grids’ utility sum is the social welfare (SW) of V2G\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nenergy trading:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.7**\narg max\nwt\ny\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWhere Y is the number of grids.

Given the condition\nof the weather, the type of EVs and grids i is given by\nthe function τi : Ω → Ti. Hence, according to the weather\ncondition, the game will have different types of EVs and\ngrids, and the payoff function for EVs and grids i is defined\nby ui : Ti × A → R. A mixed strategy for EVs and grids\ni is a function σi : Ti → ∆Ai, where ∆Ai\nis the set of\nall probability distributions on Ai. Note that a strategy\ndepends only on its own type of EVs and grids.

It includes the setup of the simulation envi-\nronment, the categorization of EVs, and the consideration of\nvarious factors, such as the EVs’ distance from the grid and\ntheir energy supply capabilities.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\n6.1.1 Metrics\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe proposed V2G energy trading model is evaluated based\non several critical performance indicators. These metrics are:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• Transaction Efficiency: The ability of the system\nto handle energy trades swiftly and with minimal\noverhead.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• EV Selection: System can select the best EVs for\ntransactions based on their energy supply and the\ndistance price, which reflects the EVs’ location rela-\ntive to the grid.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• Distance Price Consideration:How the distance of\nan EV from the grid affects the pricing and selection\nin the energy trade.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n• Microtransaction Capability:The system’s function-\nality supports small-scale transactions efficiently.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThese metrics are designed to ensure that the model not\nonly fosters competitive behavior among participants but\nalso maximizes the welfare of the V2G network by balancing\nthe revenues of EVs with the costs incurred by the grids.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n6.1.2 Benchmark Approaches\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFor a comprehensive assessment, the performance of the\nproposed V2G energy trading model was benchmarked\nagainst three other systems:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n1) DV2G: A contemporary V2G energy trading model em-\nploying DAG for transactions, referenced in [1].

Our\nproposed V2G energy trading model aims to increase par-\nticipant engagement to maximize network welfare. This\nentails maximizing EV revenue, minimizing grid costs, and\nfostering healthy competition among EVs and grids\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\n6.1.3 Results\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn the next section,we’ll discuss our simulation results, fo-\ncusing on key parameters like energy efficiency, transaction\nspeed, security, privacy, and scalability to evaluate our pro-\nposed methodology.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n6.1.3.1 Parameter Values for Grid Selection:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFigure 2 and Figure 3 show the parameter values for\nthe first and second groups of EVs, respectively, used by\nthe grid to select the appropriate EV to buy energy from.\nThese figures present the EV supply, grid demand, supply-\ndemand ratio, kWh, distance, distance price, and total price\nof the six EVs in each group. The grid aims to find the\nEV that provides the lowest price based on the unit price,\nproximity, and energy supply. The best value for the grid\nis the lowest accumulative price of energy-selling EVs. The\ngraphs show that the grid finds the best EVs in both groups\nseparately (EV2 in Figure 2 and EV6 in Figure 3) and com-\npares these best-discharging EVs based on the total energy\nsupply price. If the prices of both EVs are equal, then the\ngrid selects the EV of the first group because it fulfills the\ngrid demand at time slot t. In Figure 2 and Figure 3, the\ndistance and distance price parameters reflect the location\nof each EV relative to the grid. The graphs indicate that if\nan EV is closer to the grid, its distance reward will be lower\nthan when it is far away. This suggests that the grid prior-\nitizes selecting EVs closer to the grid to minimize energy\ntransportation costs. The supply-demand ratio parameter\nreflects the balance between the energy supply and demand\nin the grid. The graphs show that the grid selects the EVs\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthat can provide energy to the grid based on the supply-\ndemand ratio. The kWh and total price parameters reflect\nthe energy supply and price of each EV. The graphs suggest\nthat the grid prioritizes selecting the EVs that can provide\nenergy at a lower price to the grid to minimize energy costs.\nFigure 2 and Figure 3 provide important information about\nthe parameters used by the grid to select the appropriate EV\nto buy energy from and the best value for the grid, which is\nthe lowest accumulative price of energy-selling EVs. These\nfigures can help inform decisions about the management\nof EVs in the grid and to optimize their utilization in the\nenergy system. If the prices of both EVs are equal, then the\ngrid selects the EV of the first group because it fulfills the\ngrid demand at time slot t\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n6.1.3.2 EV Pricing and Utility Analysis:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFigure 4 shows the price comparison of the first group’s\ntotal energy prices of EVs with the average net utility of\nEVs and Figure 5 shows the price comparison of the second\ngroup’s total energy prices of EVs with the average net\nutility of EVs. In the figures, the blue bars indicate the\naverage net utility and the red bars show the EVs whose\nenergy prices are greater than the average net utility. The\ngray bars indicate the EVs whose prices are lower than the\naverage net utility. The green bars show the best EV, i.e., the\nEV with the lowest price at time slot t. In this case, as the\nbest prices in both groups are equal, EV2 in the first group\nis chosen by the grid.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFigure 6 shows iterations and NCG convergence. The\ngraph shows that EVs change their energy price with the\niterations and reach a stable state, where they achieve\nmaximum utility. The EVs change their prices to increase\nthe selection probability that is given by the grid to EVs.\nThe noncooperative game among the EVs begins for energy\ntrading when the grid assigns selection probabilities to the\nEVs.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n6.1.3.3 Transaction Costs and Execution Time:\nFigure 7 shows the execution cost of transaction con-\nfirmation. The bubble sizes show that when the number\nof transactions increases, the transactions’ cumulative ex-\necution cost also increases. It is observed from the graph\nthat system performance suffers when all the transactions\nof the V2G energy trading auction process run as IOTA\ntransactions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFigure 8 shows the execution time for reading and writ-\ning transactions in the IOTA ledger. The bubble sizes show\nthat when the number of IOTA transactions increases, the\ntransaction execution time also increases. This graph also\nshows that system performance suffers when all read/write\ntransactions of the V2G energy trading auction process run\nas an IOTA transaction. Figure 9 shows execution cost vs the\nsize of data (in bytes). The graph shows that the execution\ncost increases with increasing data size.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\n6.1.3.4 DLT Transaction Comparison:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nFigure 10 shows a comparison of\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nthe traditional\nblockchain-based auction scheme in [28] and the proposed\nauction scheme based on the number of IOTA transactions.\nThe graph shows that the number of IOTA transactions for\nevery EV is fixed in the proposed auction scheme, reducing\nthe IOTA transaction execution cost.

The graph shows that the EV providing a lower price\nhave a higher selection probability than those providing\nhigher prices. The figure shows the changes in price values\nwith color. The red color indicates the minimum probability\nof selection and maximum price, and the dark blue color\nshows the maximum likelihood of selection with minimum\nprice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe DV2G algorithm optimizes energy flow between\nEVs and the grid to minimize costs and maximize revenue.\nIn our model, a privacy-preserving protocol in IOTA pro-\ntects EV location data. We mitigate risks of fake offers and\nmalicious behavior by implementing a deposit mechanism,\nensuring payment based on price agreements before energy\ntransfer. In V2G energy trading, there are chances of fake\nbuyers and sellers, such as EVs making offers for energy\nthey do not have and malicious grids refusing to pay for\nalready bought energy. In the proposed model, we use a\ndeposit mechanism in which each EV deposits some money\nwith every offer of energy selling, and the grid will make its\npayments with the price agreement, not after receiving the\nenergy to mitigate these threats.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn V2G energy trading, the grid always wants to buy\nenergy cheaply. In the DV2G model, the auction selects\nthe EV providing the lowest price. The lowest price may\nbe unsuitable for the grid to buy energy, or multiple EVs\nmay have the lowest price. However, the DV2G model\nhas no mechanism to handle these cases. In the proposed\nmodel, we use off-IOTA negotiation, in which the EV and\ngrid negotiate the energy price at time slot t. EV prices are\nreduced in the proposed model, which increases the grids’\nwelfare.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.5**p== 12.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWe have conducted an extensive and meticulous analy-\nsis, providing substantial evidence to substantiate our claim\nthat the proposed algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium.

Efficient energy utilization requires keeping track of the interactions between the producers and consumers so that producers can adjust their supplies according to con- sumer demands [1]. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) energy trading is one of the most promising solutions for this problem [2].In particular, EVs can use energy storage to reduce the grid load by trading excess energy[3].EVs can accumulate energy and sell extra energy to the grid when parked[4].   Centralized platforms are unsuitable for managing V2G transactions due to problems including single point of fail- ure, poor scalability, reduced control over data integrity, and lack of transparency. Hence, distributed ledger technology   (DLT) based solutions such as blockchains are currently favored for verifying and storing energy trading transac- tions[5]. While blockchains offer secure P2P trading and reliable storage, their effectiveness in V2G networks is still under evaluation([1], [6], [7]), they still suffer from the long block verification delay resulting in low throughput, and they can be rather compute-intensive [8]. Moreover, conventional blockchains do not support microtransactions since the value of such transactions is typically less than the incentives offered to miners. On the other hand, large V2G transactions can become unprofitable due to increased transaction costs.   In this paper, we propose an IOTA DLT-based approach [9] for V2G energy trading, which aims to overcome the shortcomings mentioned above of blockchain-based ap- proaches. The main contributions of this paper are as fol- lows: The main contributions of this paper are as follows:   • We design an IOTA DLT-based energy trading model for V2G networks and propose a privacy-preserving protocol for energy trading in V2G networks. The protocol allows the system to prevent tracking the exact locations of EVs and securely perform the price negotiations between the EVs and grids in the V2G network.   • We show that energy trading between the EVs and grids in the V2G network can be modeled as a Stackelberg game, with multiple leaders represented by EVs and multiple followers represented by grids. Based on the game model, we formulate the algo- rithm that incentivizes EVs to participate in energy trading while enabling the grids to select the EVs with the best offers.   security of the IOTA DLT, where EVs must deposit IOTA coins with their energy offers, and grids pay in IOTA coins at the time of price agreement. This ensures that the EVs are committed to their energy offers and discourages malicious behavior.   To evaluate our scheme’s effectiveness, we compare it with a recent blockchain-based V2G energy trading ap- proach. Though both leverage DLT and game theory, they differ in focus and approach. Simulations demonstrate our scheme’s superior cost-effectiveness.   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related work on different approaches for V2G energy trading. Section 3 presents the necessary background on IOTA. Section 4 presents the system model and the pro- posed IOTA-based protocol for privacy-preserving energy trading in V2G networks. In Section 5, we formulate the game model of energy trading between the EVs and grids, based on which we construct the algorithms that incentivize the EVs to participate in energy trading while, at the same time, enabling the grids to select the EVs with the best offers. In Section 6, we evaluate the performance and security of the proposed system. Finally,and we conclude the paper and discuss future work in Section 7.   2 RELATED WORK This section reviews existing work on decentralized V2G energy trading, which has captured increasing attention of both industry and academia in recent years. In [10], the authors proposed a privacy-preserving, automated, reliable blockchain-based protocol to select the optimum charging stations based on the distance from EVs and energy price. Although the protocol achieves a relatively small overhead, it does not prevent possible dishonest behavior by EVs in negotiations. In [11], the authors proposed a Bayesian game-based scheme for energy trading in V2V. The result shows that user satisfaction in the proposed scheme reaches 98% with incomplete information. However, the proposed scheme has poor runtime performance because all pro- cesses run as blockchain transactions. In [12], the authors designed the architecture of a decentralized power trading system of EVs, which is consortium blockchain-based. The proposed scheme’s security evaluation showed that it is resilient against different types of attacks. However, the model did not consider the uncertainty about the range of the discharging vehicles. In [13], the authors proposed a fog computing-based architecture for energy trading. Their evaluation demonstrated that the genetic algorithm achieves maximum social welfare, which is 71.03% more than the Lagrange algorithm.   However, performance suffers because all the auction processes run as a blockchain transaction. In [14], the au- thors designed a system called FeneChain for decentral- ized energy trading. The results showed that FeneChain performs better than the other three schemes regarding energy sales and energy purchase computational costs. However, the authors did not consider fairness. In [15], the authors proposed a blockchain-based differential auction of private energy for microgrids. They showed that the pro- posed mechanism performs better than other mechanisms for auctions. However, no incentive was provided in the   auction process to guide energy suppliers/buyers. In [16], the authors leveraged blockchain technology to develop a P2P secure energy trading system. They showed that the proposed scheme’s benefits increase when the number of EVs in the network increases. In [17], the authors pro- posed a framework for secure energy trading based on a consortium blockchain. Although the scheme performs well in maximizing social welfare, it is rather compute- intensive, prohibiting widespread deployment. In [5], the authors proposed a consortium blockchain-based frame- work of V2G energy trading, which is efficient and secure for cyber-physical systems. They showed that the proposed framework is promising in terms of provided security, the performance of task offloading, and contract feasibility. However, the local energy aggregators cannot purchase the larger services when the transaction fee is low. In [18], a blockchain-based privacy-preserving network of incentive announcements was proposed. See Supplementary Table for details. The authors compared the proposed protocol with others and showed that it is more efficient. However, blockchain’s high computation resource requirements pre- vent incentive announcements from being widely deployed. In [19], a blockchain-based real-time system that uses a cryp- tocurrency and a prioritization concept called SMERCOIN to incentivize EVs to charge in a renewable energy-friendly schedule was proposed.   The evaluation results showed that the local consump- tion rate increased to 37%, decreasing the aggregator’s energy cost. However, the work only focused on renew- able energy consumption rates and did not consider EV privacy. More recent work by Zhang et al. [20], Sharma et al. [21] and Liang et al. [22] have also proposed blockchain- based approaches for V2G energy trading, but they carry the same disadvantages as other blockchain-based models. In [1], the authors proposed a Directed Acyclic Graph- based lightweight protocol for V2G (DV2G). The proposed model’s evaluation showed that it supports microtransac- tions and is highly scalable. However, it did not consider EV privacy. In [6], the authors proposed a distributed network of charging stations for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based on IOTA. They showed that the proposed scheme provides better revenue and utility for charging stations and UAVs than traditional blockchain-based schemes. In [7], the authors proposed a blockchain-based system of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data trading, which uses a debit-credit mech- anism using a two-stage Stackelberg game. The scheme is limited to data trading and does not focus on energy transactions. In [23], The authors introduced a blockchain- based spectrum trading platform for UAV cellular networks, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness in enhancing privacy and security. However, the proposed scheme lacks specific strategies to prevent malicious providers and buy- ers.   IOTA is an open-source DLT designed specifically for the In- ternet of Things. It is based on the tangle data structure that uses directed acyclic graph (DAG) characteristics. IOTA uti- lizes digital identities to assure trust among its participants,   called network nodes[24]. In IOTA, digital identity verifica- tions are decentralized and free from third parties. Private and virtual pseudo-anonymous wallets store the IOTA coins of smart devices. Computational cost is a major obstacle in verifying transactions in traditional blockchains[25]. The details are provided in a supplementary file.   if discharging,   1, 0, otherwise,.   4 SYSTEM MODEL The main objective of our proposed V2G energy trading model is to encourage more participants to participate in the process of energy trading to maximize the V2G network welfare.The EVs and grids act as prosumers, which produce and consume energy. The energy trading benefit in a V2G network is maximized by maximizing the revenue of grids (buyers) and EVs (sellers). Our proposed model considers six parameters to maximize the overall system benefits: transaction efficiency, EV privacy, fake energy offers, the best EV selection at time slot t, EV distance price, and microtransactions.   The main components of the proposed V2G energy trad-   ing model are as follows:   1) Energy nodes: The EVs and grids are the energy nodes in the V2G network. The EVs can act as prosumers (pro- ducing and consuming energy) and as energy sellers. The grids work as energy buyers.   2) Energy aggregator: This is an energy-trading broker be- tween the EVs as energy sellers and the grids as energy buyers. In the IOTA DLT, the brokerage mechanism employed in the aggregator can be realized using smart contracts that allow direct communication between the EVs and grids.   3) Smart meters: These contain details regarding how much   energy is traded between the EVs and grids.   In this section, we describe the V2G network energy trading model. Table 1 provides a summary of the symbols used in the model.   The V2G system operates on a time-slotted basis with t denoting the time slot number and ∆t being the time slot duration.   Let P = {1, ..., i, ..., p} be the set of prosumers. We define the energy generation profile of prosumer i for one day as:   where Gt i is the power generated by the prosumer i during time slot t, and T is the number of time slots per day. We define the power consumption profile of prosumer i as:   where U t time slot t.   i is the power consumption of prosumer i during   Prosumer i’s energy storage calculated in terms of ESUs   is computed at the time of charging/discharging as:   Bt c,i are binary variables meeting the following condition to avoid simultaneous charging and discharging:   We calculate the ESU’s total energy storage as   Here, ηt i represents the prosumer i’s total energy amount stored in the ESU at time slot t, and ηt−∆t represents the prosumer i’s energy storage in the ESU at the start of time slot t.   The minimum and maximum charging limits are ex- pressed using the following equation, where these limits are decided based on the SP inverter size.   represents the maximum charging power, and   represents the maximum discharging power.   Prosumer i profits if the ESUs’ daily cost is less than the   total savings obtained in a day.   γi = (CCi + SCi)/d,   where γi represents the total cost per day. CCi is the combined cost for the ESU and converter, SCi represents the annual sustaining cost, and d represents the number of days in a year.   µi = αi–γi,   where µi represents the total profit in a day of prosumer i, and αi shows the total savings in a day.   Let X be the total number of sellers (EVs), and Y be the total number of buyers (grids), where x ∈ X and y ∈ Y . Prosumer i’s production-to-consumption ratio at time slot t is calculated as   If ξt i is greater than 1, it means that the EV has surplus energy. The total amount of energy that the EV i sells to the grid at time slot t is calculated using the following equation:   where Ψt y,buy represents the amount of energy that the grid buys at time slot t [1]. ψy represents the total grid capacity of energy storage, and ψt y,s represents the grid’s level of storage at time slot t.   V2G energy trading in the system scenario considered in this work may face the following threats:   • T1: The EV changes selling prices after a grid com-   mits to an offer made by it.   • T2: The EV makes fake energy-selling offers to attract grids and manipulate the operation of the whole system.   • T3: The grid refuses to pay for the energy provided   by an EV after the energy transfer takes place.   • T4: The EV masquerades as another EV to collect the   payments for its energy sales.   • T5: The EV masquerades as another EV to make fake   energy offers on its behalf.   • T6: The grid makes a fake energy purchase commit-   ment on behalf of another grid.   • T7: The energy selling offer made by an EV is modi-   fied by an adversary.   • T8: The energy purchase bid made by a grid is   modified by an adversary.   for privacy- In this section, we describe the protocol preserving energy trading between the EVs and grids in the V2G network. The basic privacy requirements for this protocol are as follows:   1) LocationPrivacy: No participant can determine the ex- act positions of EVs in real time. This ensures that the   location privacy of EVs is protected, preventing any po- tential tracking or profiling based on their movements. 2) SchedulePrivacy: The privacy of EVs and their charg- the ing schedules must be maintained throughout charging process. This safeguards the confidentiality of their charging patterns, which could otherwise reveal sensitive information about EV owners’ habits and rou- tines.   In the DLT, each participant (i.e., the EV or grid) uses the system-provided unique anonymous ID ζ. The map- ping between the participant’s ID and its true identity is known only to the system. Hence, the true identity of each participant is unknown to other participants. Nevertheless, deanonymization of participants is possible by relating keys and transactions [26]. The ID ζ changes for every request to mitigate the deanonymization problem by creating a new pair of keys to enhance EVs’ privacy. We assume that the grid list and positions are known publicly. Figure 1 shows an overview of the V2G energy trading process. The protocol consists of four phases, as described below.   4.3.1 Bidding phase   In the bidding phase, EVs place the ESO with a unique identity to the grid in an immutable and public way with a deposit. The ESO’s public nature incentivizes other dis- charging EVs to keep their prices competitive. The ESOs contain the energy amount e ∈ Q+, at time slot t ∈ T , geographic region r ∈ R, and selling price p. The region should be chosen broadly so that the privacy of EVs is protected but within EVs’ feasible range. No one participant finds out anything beyond ESO(e, t, r, p,) and the ID ζ. Given (e, t, r, p,), no participant can determine the exact locations of EVs because the different ESOs are disconnected from others. The selling offers cannot be directly related to the specific discharging vehicle because only the ID ζ of   discharging EVs is shown with the ESO (without identifying the exact position of the EV). Once the ESOs are submitted to the ledger, they are visible to all the grids and all discharging EVs.   4.3.2 Evaluation phase   In the evaluation phase, the grids assess the discharging EVs’ ESOs based on their distance, energy supply, and price. The grid finds the optimum discharging EVs according to the total energy price. In the case of many demands from the grids to discharge EVs, the EVs select among them uniformly. EVs use a non-cooperative game (NCG) strategy to update their prices to enhance their selection probability. Grids privately decide on the bid in an off-IOTA manner.   4.3.3 Negotiation phase   In the negotiation phase, the grid communicates with dis- charging EVs to set the energy price off-IOTA. When both agree on the price, then the agreed transaction is submitted to the IOTA ledger. The ESO of discharging EVs contain (e, t, r, p), and the grids i check their positions and other pa- rameters discussed in the evaluation phase to find appropri- ate discharging EVs. When appropriate discharging EVs are found, grids create their bids based on NCG bi = f (e, t, p). This function shows that grid i desires to purchase energy e from EV ζ in the given time slot for bi ≤ bj, j = 1, ..., N . If the discharging EV agrees on the given grid’s bid bi, then the transaction is written in the IOTA ledger. The negotiation process continues until price convergence or a set time limit. The grid may accept EV bids immediately or update prices. Upon agreement, the final price is determined. Once the EV and grid have agreed on the appropriate price, the grid binds the commitment computationally c = H(ζ,¯i, rn) by combining the index of grid i and ID of EV ζ and freshly creating a random number for it. The binding commitment is sent to the IOTA ledger.   4.3.4 Charging phase   The transaction is executed directly between the grid and EV in the charging phase. The phase opens the commitment by sending ζ, ¯i, and rn to verify the selected grid. The grid checks the commitment and verifies H(ζ,¯i, rn) = c and verifies whether the time of the transaction matches the commitment time. Energy e is exchanged on commitment price bi in the given time slot t. This commitment transaction is only performed between the selected grid and EV. The discharging EV’s actual position is shown to the selected grid at this stage. However, this commitment information is not shown to the IOTA network. In the process of open commitment, EV reveals the ID ζ, and no other EV has the same identity due to using a cryptographic hash function for the commitment binding. As such, the grid proves that it communicates with the valid discharging EVs. After the charging phase is complete, a new ID is assigned to each discharging EV.   5 GAME MODEL OF THE V2G NETWORK This section presents the hierarchical game model governing energy trading dynamics in the V2G system. EVs act as sellers, while smart grids serve as buyers. The hierarchy   starts with a non-cooperative game (NCG), representing EVs competing to sell power at optimal prices to the grid. EVs equipped with solar panels negotiate with smart grids throughout the day. EVs strategically adjust their selling prices based on energy generation and battery levels, while grids dynamically adjust purchase prices based on predicted consumption patterns. Next, a Stackelberg game (SG) cap- tures the interaction between EVs and grids. Here, EVs alternate between leading and following roles, influencing market dynamics with surplus energy. For instance, an EV may lead by strategically withholding energy during peak demand, prompting grids to offer better purchase terms. Finally, another NCG governs grid interactions, with oper- ators adapting strategies to optimize profit while ensuring energy supply meets demand.   5.1 EVs employ NCG to make more profit   The EVs employ NCG because they compete in a non- cooperative way with each other to make more profit by selling energy at the best price to the grid. When the grid’s demand is greater than or equal to EV i’s supply, EV i’s utility is calculated by ui(Et   When the grid’s demand is less than the supply, EV i’s utility is calculated by   Nash equilibrium is a notion in game theory that identifies the best solution in an NGC, where participants have no incentive to change their initial approach. Under the Nash Equilibrium, a player gains nothing by departing from their initial plan, assuming the other players’ strategies remain unchanged. There may be several Nash equilibria in a game or none at all.   The Nash equilibrium is attained when each EV sells its total surplus energy, which is the goal of the proposed algorithm. A predefined set of conditions is in place to achieve this equilibrium point in NCG. One necessary con- dition is that a finite number of players must be satisfied by having X EVs participating. The game continues until the grid demand, denoted as Ψt y,buy is fully satisfied or all the surplus energy from the discharging EVs has been sold. The algorithm facilitates this equilibrium by allowing each EV to decide how much extra energy to deal with, optimizing their utility or profit. The surplus energy is then allocated to the grid, ensuring demand is met while respecting the individual decisions of the EVs. The algorithm checks if no EV can unilaterally change its decision to increase its profit, indicating the achievement of Nash equilibrium. The game terminates when the grid demand is met, or all surplus energy is sold, representing a stable equilibrium state. A discharging EV i uses the following strategy to adjust its supply to maximize its selection probability   A discharging EV i uses the following strategy to update its prices to maximize selection probability   where n represents the number of iterations. The NCG game is defined by the tuple Γ = ⟨X t, Ωt, pt, ⟨Ai, ui, T t i ⟩i∈N ⟩, where X t represents the set of EVs at time slot t, s.t. xt ∈ X t, Ωt represents the condition of the weather at time slot t, At i ) is the set of actions available for EV i at time slot t, where At N , Ti is the set of types for EV i according to the condition of the weather or the current state of the EV. Given the condition of the weather, the type of EV i is given by the function τi : Ω → Ti [27]. Therefore, according to the weather condition, the game will have different types of EVs. The payoff function for EV i is defined by ui : Ti × A → R, and p is the probability distribution for the weather condition Ω. A mixed strategy for EVs i is a function xi : Ti → ∆Ai, where ∆Ai is the set of all probability distributions on Ai. Note that a strategy depends only on its type of EVs. A strategy profile x represents the strategy for each EV. The strategy profile finds out the expected payoffs for each EV, where the expectation is taken based on both the weather condition and EV types in terms of beliefs p, and the randomization over actions implied by any mixed strategies in the profile x.   Given a game ⟨N t, (Ai)i∈N , (ui)i∈N ⟩, the profile of the mixed strategy (xi)i∈N is called the Nash equilibrium of the mixed strategy if ∀i ∈ N   xi,price be the supply and enforced price of EV i at time slot t with choosing probabilities xi1 and xi2. Let Et xj ,price be the supply and enforced price of EV j at time slot t with choosing prob- abilities xj1 and xj2. We use the mixed strategy due to the intermittent nature of supply. Besides, when the player uses the same choices every time, then other players will track these choices. This will create a privacy problem for EVs and also create the problem of using these choices to maximize its selection probability at time slot t. Hence, here we use the mixed strategy for the selection probability for EVs at time slot t. We use an arithmetic method to achieve the optimal strategy and value of the game at time slot t. Let EV i’s mixed strategy at time slot t be (xi1, xi2), where xi1 + xi2 = 1.   5.1.1 Case Study The net expected gain E1, at time slot t of EV i is   E1(EV i) = [xi1xj1]xi1 + [xi2xj1]xi2,   when EV j increases the supply at time slot t. The net expected gain E2, at time slot t of EV i is   E2(EV i) = [xi1xj2]xi1 + [xi2xj2]xi2,   when EV j decreases the price at time slot t. So for EV i, we have to find the supply and its enforced price at time slot t and value v of the game that satisfy the following relationships   [xi1xj1]xi1 + [xi2xj1]xi2 ≥ v   [xi1xj2]xi1 + [xi2xj2]xi2 ≥ v   The inequalities become strict equations for the optimum strategies.   [xi1xj1]xi1 + [xi2xj1]xi2 = v   [xi1xj2]xi1 + [xi2xj2]xi2 = v   From (23a) − (23b), we get   Plugging this value into (22c) to get the optimal price strategy at time slot t we get   From (24a), we get   Plugging xi1 and xi2 into (23a), we get the Nash equilib- rium or value of the game, as follows:   A Stackelberg Game (SG) models the relationship between the EVs acting as leaders and the microgrids acting as followers [7]. Enhances the Stackelberg game method for en- ergy trading by introducing novel features like microtrans- actions and optimized decision-making. Leveraging IOTA’s platform ensures secure, decentralized trading focusing on data privacy. These innovations demonstrate the originality and significance of our work in advancing energy trading methodologies. In the SG, EVs declare their available energy and price range for the specific time slot, and grids use the NCG to select a suitable EV. EVs use NCG to maximize their selection probability to update prices and adjust their supply according to demand based on the NCG output. EVs use NCG because they are unfamiliar with each other. The double auction algorithm achieves the Nash equilibrium in SG. The EVs update their prices by using the strategy in (18). The EVs adjust their supply utilizing the strategy in (17), and the grids use the NCG to select the best discharging EV. The energy price is the input for EVs’ NCG and grids’ NCG. The EVs’ NCG output is the best-selling energy price, which is further used as input for the grids’ NCG, and the grids’ NCG output is the best discharging EV selection. The SG establishes a connection between EVs’ NCG and grids’ NCG. EVs use the best energy supply and its price according to (24c) and (25) to maximize their selection probability at time slot t with suitable gain. Grids use (50c) and (50b) to select the best suitable EV at time slot t with appropriate gain.   The grids’ utility sum is the social welfare (SW) of V2G   energy trading:   arg max wt y   Where Y is the number of grids. The grids’ and EVs’ total profit from V2G energy trading is calculated by   defined   time slot   time slot   by where   Where X is the number of EVs, TB represents the total profit of grids and EVs and pt x represents the discharging EVs’ received payment. tuple proposed Γ = ⟨XY t, Ωt, pt, ⟨Ai, ui, T t XY t t, represents the set of grids and EVs at where xyt ∈ XY t, Ωt represents the condition of the pi) is the set of weather at actions available for EVs and grids i at time slot t, where At N , Ti is the set of types for grids and EVs i according to the condition of the weather or the current state of the EVs and grids. Given the condition of the weather, the type of EVs and grids i is given by the function τi : Ω → Ti. Hence, according to the weather condition, the game will have different types of EVs and grids, and the payoff function for EVs and grids i is defined by ui : Ti × A → R. A mixed strategy for EVs and grids i is a function σi : Ti → ∆Ai, where ∆Ai is the set of all probability distributions on Ai. Note that a strategy depends only on its own type of EVs and grids. A strategy profile σ represents the strategy for each EV and grid. The strategy profile finds out the expected payoffs for each EV and grid, where the expectation is taken based on both the weather conditions and EV and grid types in terms of beliefs p, and the randomization over actions implied by any mixed strategies in the profile σ. Given a game ⟨N t, (Ai)i∈N , (ui)i∈N ⟩, profile of the mixed strategy (σi)i∈N is called Nash equilibrium of the mixed strategy if ∀i∈N   ui(σi, σ−i) ≥ ui(σ′   n Vn).

EV i wins when V2 ≤ 2S1 and utility gains V1 − S1, EVi loses when when V2 > 2S1 and gets utility 0.   2 V . Let S1 = (Et   2s1 E[ui] = 2S1V1 − 2(S1)2 Now we find the best response for EV i at time slot t to grids by taking the partial derivatives of the expected utility of EV i at time slot t and setting it to zero.   Thus, when a grid’s energy demand and energy demand price is half of its valuation, EV i’s best response is to offer the energy at half its valuation.   5.3 Suitable EV selection by using NCG   The best discharging EV selection is made by using the NCG. The focus of NCG is on the dynamic strategy. Here we use NCG to resolve the competition among the grid. NCG is used because the grids’ strategies change dynamically to obtain a higher profit.   The NCG model group y ∈ Y consists of buyers, which are smart grids. When the EVs submit prices to the IOTA ledger, each grid for energy purchasing chooses the best possible EV. The grids select the EV independently, and the grid selection strategy is adjusted progressively. mt p denotes the probability of grid y ∈ Y choosing the EV x ∈ X in the tth time slot. The following equation is used to calculate the supply-to-demand ratio of EV x ∈ X at time slot t:   If ry,x is greater than or equal to 1, then the grid’s true value to select the suitable EV at time t to buy energy from the discharging EV is as follows:   where the distance price of EV x at time slot t is calculated by   x = (CKx)(Rt ωt   Here, ωt x represents the total distance price for EV x, CKx represents the energy consumption per kilometer of EV x, Rt x,k represents the discharging EV’s total distance range at time slot t. St x,price represents the enforced price of the discharging EV at time slot t.   If ry,x is lower than 1, then the grid’s true value to select the suitable EV at time slot t to buy energy from the discharging EV is as follows:   where Et x,less represents how much the discharging EV’s energy is less than grid demand.Grid prioritizes price or supply. For each (≥ or < demand), grid selects closest, cheapest EV at time t.   Let EV1 represent the first group’s best discharging EV, whose energy supply is greater than or equal to the grid demand, and EV2 represents the second group’s best EV, whose energy supply is less than the grid demand. The grid compares the prices of these two EVs EV1 and EV2. If both EVs’ prices are equal, then the grid selects the EV of the first group, which is EV1 because it fulfills the grid’s energy   demand at time t in every aspect. It should be noted that the first group’s and second group’s prices are calculated using (36) and (38), respectively. Another method is the average utility method, which the grids use to find the best discharging EV at time slot t. Ψt true is the net utility of a specific discharging EV for grids in which the energy supply is greater than or equal to the power demand. The average utility at time slot t is calculated by   demand, and EVn represents the second group’s best EV, whose energy supply is less than the grid demand. Let Et x,price be the supply and enforced price of EVx at time slot t. The grid selects the EVs according to the best-fit price and supply at time slot t. Let grid yj’s mixed strategy at time slot t be (yj1, yj2), where yj1 + yj2 = 1. Let grid yi’s mixed strategy at time slot t be (yi1, yi2), where yi1 + yi2 = 1, to select the best discharging EV at time slot t. The net expected gain E1, at time slot t of yi is   E1(yi) = [yi1yj1]yi1 + [yi2yj1]yi2,   Ψt l,true is the net utility of the specific discharging EV l for grids whose energy supply is less than the power demand   according to the supply of EVj at time slot t. The net expected gain E2 at time slot t of yi is   E2(yi) = [yi1xj2]yi1 + [yi2yj2]yi2,   according to the price of EVj at time slot t. So for yi, we have to find the best demand price of energy at time slot t and the value of the game that satisfy the following relationships   If the average utility ratio is less than 1, then the first group is better for searching for the best EV. If the average utility ratio is greater than 1, then the second group is better for searching for the best EV.   The utility of the grids is calculated as follows   Un = arg max   The grids’ NCG solution is represented as follows 4 , ...., EV t∗   EV t∗ = {EV t∗   Algorithm 1 shows the detailed process of the grids’ NCG. defined tuple NCG Γ = ⟨N t, Ωt, pt, ⟨Ai, ui, T t i ⟩i∈N ⟩, where N t represents the set of grids at time slot t, where nt ∈ N t, Ωt represents the condition of the weather at time slot t, At pi) is the set of actions available for grids i at time slot t, where At is the set of types for grids i according to the condition of the weather or the current state of the grids. Given the condition of the weather, the type of grids i is given by the function τi : Ω → Ti [27]. So, according to the weather condition, the game will have different types of grids; the payoff function for grids i is defined by ui : Ti × A → R, p is the probability distribution for the weather condition Ω. A mixed strategy for grids i is a function yi : Ti → ∆Ai, where ∆Ai is the set of all probability distributions on Ai. Note that a strategy depends only on its own type of the grid. A strategy profile y represents the strategy for each grid. The strategy profile finds out the expected payoffs for each grid, where the expectation is taken on the basis of both the weather condition and grids’ types in terms of beliefs p, and the randomization over actions implied by any mixed strategies in the profile y. Given a game ⟨N t, (Ai)i∈N , (ui)i∈N ⟩, profile of the mixed strategy (yi)i∈N is called Nash equilibrium of the mixed strategy if ∀i∈N   [yi1yj1]yi1 + [yi2yj1]yi2 ≥ v   [yi1yj2]yi1 + [yi2yj2]yi2 ≥ v   The inequalities become strict equations for the optimum strategies.

It includes the setup of the simulation envi- ronment, the categorization of EVs, and the consideration of various factors, such as the EVs’ distance from the grid and their energy supply capabilities.   The proposed V2G energy trading model is evaluated based on several critical performance indicators. These metrics are:   • Transaction Efficiency: The ability of the system to handle energy trades swiftly and with minimal overhead.   • EV Selection: System can select the best EVs for transactions based on their energy supply and the distance price, which reflects the EVs’ location rela- tive to the grid.   • Distance Price Consideration:How the distance of an EV from the grid affects the pricing and selection in the energy trade.   • Microtransaction Capability:The system’s function- ality supports small-scale transactions efficiently.   These metrics are designed to ensure that the model not only fosters competitive behavior among participants but also maximizes the welfare of the V2G network by balancing the revenues of EVs with the costs incurred by the grids.   For a comprehensive assessment, the performance of the proposed V2G energy trading model was benchmarked against three other systems:   1) DV2G: A contemporary V2G energy trading model em- ploying DAG for transactions, referenced in [1]. This model serves as a benchmark for transaction efficiency and microtransaction support.   2) Blockchain-Based Approach: A traditional approach to V2G energy trading that is grounded in blockchain technology, as detailed in [28].This approach provides a baseline for evaluating the enhancements our model brings to the V2G energy trading landscape.   3) Peer-to-peer Energy Trading: Designing Fairness in Autonomous Peer-to-peer Energy Trading [29] provides a foundational benchmark for fairness in V2G systems. Our IOTA-based algorithm, in comparison, excels in transaction efficiency and scalability, significantly en- hancing the V2G energy trading landscape.   4) Hierarchical Game-Theoretic Framework: Designing Fairness in Real-Time Energy Trading in Smart Grids [30], a seminal work in fairness evaluation for energy trading. Our IOTA-based algorithm, in comparison, excels in transaction efficiency and scalability, signifi- cantly enhancing the V2G energy trading landscape. 5) EV Aggregator Liability Model:Electric Vehicle Aggre- gators to Grid Liability Trading [31], a seminal work in fairness evaluation for energy trading. Our IOTA- based algorithm, in comparison, excels in transaction efficiency and scalability, significantly enhancing the V2G energy trading landscape.   The benchmarking process involves directly comparing systems based on transactional throughput, EV selection efficiency, and overall V2G network welfare impact. Our proposed V2G energy trading model aims to increase par- ticipant engagement to maximize network welfare. This entails maximizing EV revenue, minimizing grid costs, and fostering healthy competition among EVs and grids   In the next section,we’ll discuss our simulation results, fo- cusing on key parameters like energy efficiency, transaction speed, security, privacy, and scalability to evaluate our pro- posed methodology.   6.1.3.1 Parameter Values for Grid Selection:   Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the parameter values for the first and second groups of EVs, respectively, used by the grid to select the appropriate EV to buy energy from. These figures present the EV supply, grid demand, supply- demand ratio, kWh, distance, distance price, and total price of the six EVs in each group. The grid aims to find the EV that provides the lowest price based on the unit price, proximity, and energy supply. The best value for the grid is the lowest accumulative price of energy-selling EVs. The graphs show that the grid finds the best EVs in both groups separately (EV2 in Figure 2 and EV6 in Figure 3) and com- pares these best-discharging EVs based on the total energy supply price. If the prices of both EVs are equal, then the grid selects the EV of the first group because it fulfills the grid demand at time slot t. In Figure 2 and Figure 3, the distance and distance price parameters reflect the location of each EV relative to the grid. The graphs indicate that if an EV is closer to the grid, its distance reward will be lower than when it is far away. This suggests that the grid prior- itizes selecting EVs closer to the grid to minimize energy transportation costs. The supply-demand ratio parameter reflects the balance between the energy supply and demand in the grid. The graphs show that the grid selects the EVs   that can provide energy to the grid based on the supply- demand ratio. The kWh and total price parameters reflect the energy supply and price of each EV. The graphs suggest that the grid prioritizes selecting the EVs that can provide energy at a lower price to the grid to minimize energy costs. Figure 2 and Figure 3 provide important information about the parameters used by the grid to select the appropriate EV to buy energy from and the best value for the grid, which is the lowest accumulative price of energy-selling EVs. These figures can help inform decisions about the management of EVs in the grid and to optimize their utilization in the energy system. If the prices of both EVs are equal, then the grid selects the EV of the first group because it fulfills the grid demand at time slot t   6.1.3.2 EV Pricing and Utility Analysis:   Figure 4 shows the price comparison of the first group’s total energy prices of EVs with the average net utility of EVs and Figure 5 shows the price comparison of the second group’s total energy prices of EVs with the average net utility of EVs. In the figures, the blue bars indicate the average net utility and the red bars show the EVs whose energy prices are greater than the average net utility. The gray bars indicate the EVs whose prices are lower than the average net utility. The green bars show the best EV, i.e., the EV with the lowest price at time slot t. In this case, as the best prices in both groups are equal, EV2 in the first group is chosen by the grid.   Figure 6 shows iterations and NCG convergence. The graph shows that EVs change their energy price with the iterations and reach a stable state, where they achieve maximum utility. The EVs change their prices to increase the selection probability that is given by the grid to EVs. The noncooperative game among the EVs begins for energy trading when the grid assigns selection probabilities to the EVs.   6.1.3.3 Transaction Costs and Execution Time: Figure 7 shows the execution cost of transaction con- firmation. The bubble sizes show that when the number of transactions increases, the transactions’ cumulative ex- ecution cost also increases. It is observed from the graph that system performance suffers when all the transactions of the V2G energy trading auction process run as IOTA transactions.   Figure 8 shows the execution time for reading and writ- ing transactions in the IOTA ledger. The bubble sizes show that when the number of IOTA transactions increases, the transaction execution time also increases. This graph also shows that system performance suffers when all read/write transactions of the V2G energy trading auction process run as an IOTA transaction. Figure 9 shows execution cost vs the size of data (in bytes). The graph shows that the execution cost increases with increasing data size.   Figure 10 shows a comparison of   the traditional blockchain-based auction scheme in [28] and the proposed auction scheme based on the number of IOTA transactions. The graph shows that the number of IOTA transactions for every EV is fixed in the proposed auction scheme, reducing the IOTA transaction execution cost. Only three transactions in the proposed auction scheme are stored in the IOTA ledger (bidding, price agreement, and confirmation of en-   ergy transaction). Therefore the proposed auction scheme is more efficient than the traditional blockchain-based auction scheme compared against.   consumption ratios. The first and last three hours have an energy production of zero, which means no energy is generated through solar power in these periods.   6.1.3.5 V2G Supply and Production Ratios:   Figure 11 shows the supply-to-demand ratio for three EVs for different iterations. EVs must adjust their supply to increase the supply-to-demand ratio [1], as their selection probability increases with increasing supply-to-demand ra- tio. The EVs’ revenue also increases with increases in the supply-to-demand ratio.   Figure 12 shows EVs’ production consumption ratio (PCR) on an hour-of-the-day basis. In this experiment, we show the three EVs that have different production-to-   Figure 13 shows the grids’ production-to-consumption ratio on an hour-of-the-day basis. It is crucial to investigate the value of PCR to understand the model’s actual high usage at any time. The energy supply and demand and the energy sales/purchase rates also depend on the energy production-consumption ratio. When the PCR value is greater than 1, the EVs sell their excess energy at any time. When the PCR value is less than 1, the grid buys the amount of energy needed by the grid from EVs at any time.   but also facilitates a deeper understanding and broader acceptance of the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in reaching Nash equilibrium.   Improving V2G network benefits entails addressing fac- tors such as location privacy, resilience against fake energy offers, optimal price selection, EV distance pricing, and microtransaction support. The proposed model provides location privacy features to protect EVs’ privacy and has built-in resilience against fake energy offers, ensuring that the network remains secure and transparent. The model is designed to select the best price for energy, considering both the grid’s energy demand and the EVs’ availability. The proposed model also considers distance pricing, which can result in more efficient and cost-effective energy manage- ment. By addressing these various aspects of V2G energy trading, the proposed model reduces reluctance for EVs and grids to participate, leading to an overall increase in the network benefit.   In this section we discuss how the proposed scheme miti- gates the potential threats discussed in Section 4.2.   • T1: Due to the immutable writing of an energy offer by an EV to the ledger along with the deposit of an IOTA coin, it is not possible for an EV to change the selling price after a grid commits to the offer.   • T2: The deposit of an IOTA coin with an energy- selling offer prevents a fake energy-selling offer from the EV, as the deposit would be lost.   • T3: The automated handling of the payment by the grid through smart contracts prevents the case of a grid not paying for the energy transfer.   • T4: All transactions are performed with authentica- tion of the selling and buying parties through their digital IOTA IDs, preventing EVs from masquerad- ing as other EVs to collect payments.   • T5: Energy offer transactions are digitally signed by the prosumers and verified by the other parties in DLT, making it impossible to make fake energy offers on behalf of other EVs.   • T6: Energy purchase commitments made by grids in the system are digitally signed by the grids, making it impossible to make an energy purchase commitment on behalf of another grid.   • T7: The digital signature on the cryptographic hash of each transaction prevents adversaries from modi- fying contents of an energy selling offer to produce the correct signature.   • T8: Grid’s digital signature on the bid’s hash ensures   tamper-proof energy purchase bids,   Leveraging IOTA’s features and a designed energy trading protocol, our system ensures security and fairness. The non-cooperative game model prevents price manipulation, fostering equitable outcomes for all parties involved.   7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this work, we proposed an IOTA-based efficient and secure energy trading model for V2G networks, where EVs   6.1.3.6 EV Pricing and Utility Analysis: Figure 14 shows how the EV selection probability varies with the price. The graph shows that the EV providing a lower price have a higher selection probability than those providing higher prices. The figure shows the changes in price values with color. The red color indicates the minimum probability of selection and maximum price, and the dark blue color shows the maximum likelihood of selection with minimum price.   The DV2G algorithm optimizes energy flow between EVs and the grid to minimize costs and maximize revenue. In our model, a privacy-preserving protocol in IOTA pro- tects EV location data. We mitigate risks of fake offers and malicious behavior by implementing a deposit mechanism, ensuring payment based on price agreements before energy transfer. In V2G energy trading, there are chances of fake buyers and sellers, such as EVs making offers for energy they do not have and malicious grids refusing to pay for already bought energy. In the proposed model, we use a deposit mechanism in which each EV deposits some money with every offer of energy selling, and the grid will make its payments with the price agreement, not after receiving the energy to mitigate these threats.   In V2G energy trading, the grid always wants to buy energy cheaply. In the DV2G model, the auction selects the EV providing the lowest price. The lowest price may be unsuitable for the grid to buy energy, or multiple EVs may have the lowest price. However, the DV2G model has no mechanism to handle these cases. In the proposed model, we use off-IOTA negotiation, in which the EV and grid negotiate the energy price at time slot t. EV prices are reduced in the proposed model, which increases the grids’ welfare.   We have conducted an extensive and meticulous analy- sis, providing substantial evidence to substantiate our claim that the proposed algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium. Our rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrates that the algo- rithm satisfies the conditions for a potential game, which guarantees the existence of a Nash equilibrium. Further- more, our meticulously designed and executed simulation experiments consistently exhibit convergence to Nash equi- librium across a range of scenarios. This comprehensive validation not only fortifies our contribution to the field   As part of future work, we aim to extend this study to focus on grid-to-vehicle (G2V) scenarios, exploring en- ergy trading dynamics between grids and individual vehi- cles. Furthermore, we will explore privacy-preserving tech- niques for anonymizing data in G2V energy trading, specif- ically tailored to this context. These research directions will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of en- ergy trading dynamics in V2G systems and facilitate the de- velopment of robust, secure, and privacy-aware G2V energy trading frameworks.

The main objective of the proposed V2G energy trading model is to encourage more participants in the trading pro- cess to maximize the V2G network welfare. A three-game model is used for optimal price selection with interactions between EVs and grids. A deposit mechanism is proposed for preventing fake energy trading between the EVs and grids, where EVs deposit IOTA coins with energy offers and grids pay with IOTA coins at the time of price agreement. The proposed scheme also protects the location privacy of EVs. We have shown with simulations that the proposed scheme performs better than a recently proposed DLT-based scheme in terms of efficiency, privacy, resilience against fake energy trading, and price.

         "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in content generation and intelligent intelligent decision making for IoT systems. Traditionally, LLMs are deployed on the cloud, incurring prolonged latency, high bandwidth costs, and privacy concerns. More recently, edge computing has been considered promising in addressing such concerns because the edge devices are closer to data sources. However, edge devices are cursed by their limited resources and can hardly afford LLMs. Existing studies address such a limitation by offloading heavy workloads from edge to cloud or compressing LLMs via model quantization. These methods either still rely heavily on the remote cloud or suffer substantial accuracy loss. This work is the first to deploy LLMs on a collaborative edge computing environment, in which edge devices and cloud servers share resources and collaborate to infer LLMs with high efficiency and no accuracy loss. We design EdgeShard, a novel approach to partition a computation-intensive LLM into affordable shards and deploy them on distributed devices. The partition and distribution are nontrivial, considering device heterogeneity, bandwidth limitations, and model complexity. To this end, we formulate an adaptive joint device selection and model partition problem and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the inference latency and throughput. Extensive experiments of the popular Llama2 serial models on a real-world testbed reveal that EdgeShard achieves up to 50% latency reduction and $2 \\times $ throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art.",

Many players are\ncoming into this field with their advanced models, such as\nOpenAI’s GPT-4 [1], Meta’s Llama [2], and Google’s PALM\n[3]. Built on the foundation of transformer architecture [4],\nLLMs are characterized by their massive scale in terms of\nthe number of parameters and the amount of data they are\ntrained on. The scale of LLMs, often numbering in hundreds\nof billions of parameters, enables the models to capture\ncomplex patterns in language and context, making them highly\neffective at generating coherent and contextually appropriate\nresponses. Such a phenomenon is also known as ”intelligence\nemergence”. The outstanding capability of LLMs makes them\nvaluable and well-performed in a wide range of applications,\nfrom ChatBot and content generation (e.g., text summation and\ncode generation) to assisting tools of education and research.\nHowever, current LLMs heavily rely on cloud computing,\nsuffering from long response time, high bandwidth cost, and\nprivacy concerns [5].

Secondly,\nthe transmission of large amounts of data, including texts,\nto the cloud\nvideo,\ndata centers leads to substantial bandwidth consumption and\nimmense strain on the network architecture. Thirdly, cloud-\nbased LLMs raise significant privacy issues, especially when\nhandling sensitive data of hospitals and banks, as well as\npersonal data like text inputs and photos on mobile phones.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nEdge computing is a promising solution to address the afore-\nmentioned challenges by deploying LLMs on edge devices\n(e.g., edge servers, edge gateways, and mobile phones) at the\nnetwork edge closer to the data sources [6]. However, LLMs\nare computation-intensive and resource-greedy. For example,\nthe inference of a full-precision Llama2-7B model requires at\nleast 28GB memory, which may exceed the capacity of most\nedge devices. Some works leverage model quantization [7]–\n[12] to reduce the model size to fit into the resource-constraint\nedge devices. However, they often lead to accuracy loss. Other\nworks tend to use cloud-edge collaboration [13], [14], which\npartitions the LLMs into two sub-models and offloads part of\nthe computation workload to the powerful cloud servers with\nhigh-end GPUs. However, the latency between edge devices\nand cloud servers is usually high and unstable.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAlternatively, we have witnessed the continuous growth\nof the computing power of edge in recent years, and a\nlarge number of edge servers and edge clouds have been\ndeployed at the network edge, leaving significant resources\nto be used.

CEC is different from existing edge computing\nresearch. Existing edge computing research focuses on the\nvertical collaboration among cloud, edge, and end devices,\nwhile neglecting horizontal edge-to-edge collaborations, suf-\nfering from unoptimized resource utilization, restricted service\ncoverage, and uneven performance.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nMotivated by the vision of CEC, we propose a general LLM\ninference framework, named EdgeShard, to support efficient\ncollaborative LLM inference on distributed edge devices and\ncloud servers. For simplicity, we use computing devices below\nto refer to edge devices and cloud servers. Given a network\nwith heterogeneous computing devices, EdgeShard partitions\nthe LLM into multiple shards and allocates them to judicious\ndevices based on the heterogeneous computation and network-\ning resources, as well as the memory budget of devices. To\noptimize performance, we formulate a joint device selection\nand model partition problem and design an efficient dynamic\nprogramming algorithm to minimize the inference latency and\nmaximize the inference throughput, respectively.

Deploying LLM at\nedge computing is vastly different from that in the cloud.\nFirst, cloud servers are usually with homogeneous GPUs,\nwhile edge devices are with heterogeneous computation ca-\npabilities in nature. Second, modern cloud GPUs for LLMs\nare usually connected by high-bandwidth networks, such as\nInfiniBand and Nvlinks, while edge devices are connected with\nheterogeneous and low-bandwidth networks. For example, the\nbandwidth of NVlinks can go up to 600GB/s, while the\nbandwidth among edge devices ranges from dozens of Kbps\nto 1000Mbps.

LLMs generally refer to\ndecoder-based transformer models with billions of parameters.\nDifferent from encoder-based architecture like BERT [19],\nwhose inference process is single phase, the process of LLM\ninference is iterative and typically involves two phases: the\nprompt processing phase and the autoregressive generation.\nThe prompt processing phase is also known as prefill.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the prompt processing phase, the model takes the user\ninitial token (x1, ..., xn) as input and generates the first new to-\nken xn+1 by computing the probability P (xn+1 | x1, ..., xn).\nIn the autoregressive generation phase, the model generates\none token at a time, based on both the initial input and the\ntokens it has generated so far. This phase generates tokens\nsequentially for multiple iterations until a stopping criterion\nis met, i.e., either when generating an end-of-sequence (EOS)\ntoken or reaching the maximum number of tokens specified\nby user or constrained by the LLM.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.4**\nthe model\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs shown in Fig. 2, suppose the LLM model has N layers,\nwhich will take a sequence of input tokens and run all layers\nto generate a token in a one-by-one manner. In the prefill\nphase,\ntakes the input (”Today is a”) at once,\nand the first generated token is ”good.” In the autoregressvie\ngeneration phase, the model first takes (”Today is a good”)\nas input and generates the next token (”day”). It then takes\n(”Today is a good day”) as input and generates the next token\n(”EOS”), which indicates the end of the generation. Since a\ntoken generated is determined by all its previous token in\na sequence, LLMs utilize Key-Value caching (KV caching)\nto avoid repetitive computation, storing past computations to\nexpedite responses, thereby reducing computational workload\nand improving response times. The time to generate a token\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFig. 3.

A single edge device may\nnot have sufficient memory to accommodate a LLM model.\nTake one of the most popular LLM models, i.e., Llama2,\nas an example. As shown in Table. I, Llama2 has three\ndifferent versions, i.e., 7B, 13B, and 70B. We can see from the\nTable that the full precision inference of Llama2-7B requires\nthe smartphones usually only\nat\nhave 6-12 GB memory, and the Jetson Orin NX has 8-16\nGB memory. They are unable to burden the on-device LLM\ninference. Some works try to use low-precision quantization,\ne.g., 8 bit and 4 bit. However, it may still exceed the memory\ncapacity of edge devices. For example, the 4-bit inference of\nLlama2-70B requires at least 35GB memory, which cannot be\naccommodated on most edge devices. Moreover, low-precision\ninference leads to performance degradation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn this work, we leverage collaborative edge computing,\na computing paradigm where geo-distributed edge devices\nand cloud servers collaborate to perform computational tasks.\nBased on that idea, we propose EdgeShard, a general LLM\ninference framework that allows adaptive device selection and\nLLM partition over distributed computing devices, to address\nthe high memory requirements and leverage heterogeneous\nresources to optimize LLM inference.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIII. COLLABORATIVE EDGE COMPUTING FOR LLMS\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThere are three stages of the framework, including profiling,\ntask scheduling optimization, and collaborative inference.

Those traces include: 1) the execution time of\neach layer on different devices; 2) the size of activations and\nmemory consumption for each layer of the LLM model; 3)\navailable memory of each device and the bandwidth among\ndevices. For the execution time of each layer, we profile the\ntime to generate a token in the prefill stage and autoregressive\nstage, respectively, and take the average. For those devices\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\n(a) Sequential inference\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.7**r== 0.1**\n(b) Pipeline parallel inference\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nFig. 4.

The profiling information will\nthen be used to support intelligent task scheduling strategies.\nScheduling Optimization. At the task scheduling optimiza-\ntion stage, the scheduler generates a deployment strategy by\ndetermining which device to participate in, how to partition\nthe LLM model in a layer wise, and which device should the\nmodel shard be allocated to. The strategy thoroughly considers\nthe heterogeneous resources, the memory budget of devices,\nand the privacy constraint, and later be applied to selected\ndevices for efficient LLM inference. More details is described\nin Sec. IV.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nCollaborative inference. After getting the LLM model par-\ntition and allocation strategy, the selected devices will perform\nthe collaborative inference. We pre-allocate memory space for\nKV cache on each participating device. We consider two cases\nfor the collaborative inference, i.e., sequential inference and\npipeline parallel inference.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn sequential inference, devices take turns to perform the\ncomputation with the allocated model shards. As shown in\nFig. 4(a), suppose the LLM model is partitioned into 3 shards\nand allocated to device 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

LLMs usually have a layered architecture,\nwhich consists of an embedding layer, multiple decoder layer,\nand an output layer. Sizes of parameters and activations (i.e.,\nthe output of a layer) vary across layers. We assume the model\nis with N layers. Oi represents the size of activations of layer\ni, 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1.

They\nwill have the out-of-memory issue (OOM). However, Edge-\nShard tackles this challenge by splitting the large model into\nshards and allocating them to multiple devices, enabling col-\nlaborative model inference. Second, EdgeShard achieves obvi-\nously lower inference latency and higher inference throughput\nthan baseline methods. For Llama2-7B model, EdgeShard\nachieves 75.88ms latency, which is about 1.85x faster than\nEdge-Solo and Cloud-Edge-Opt, and about 3x faster than\nCloud-Edge-Even. For the inference throughput, EdgeShard\nachieves 52.45 tokens per second with a maximum batch size\nof 8, which is around 2.2 times larger than Edge-Solo and\nCloud-Edge-Opt, and about 7 times larger than Cloud-Edge-\nis also observed\nEven. Similar performance improvement\nfor Llama2-13B model, where EdgeShard achieves 45.7%\nand 28.8% lower latency than Cloud-Edge-Even and Cloud-\nEdge-Opt, respectively. Also, EdgeShard has 2.23x and 2.2x\nhigher throughput than Cloud-Edge-Even and Cloud-Edge-\nOpt. Third, we can also see that, for Llama2-7B, Cloud-Edge-\nOpt tends to have the same performance in terms of both\ninference latency and throughput as Edge-Solo. This is because\nthe bandwidth between the source node and the cloud server\nis very limited in this experimental setting, i.e., 1Mbps. The\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\noptimal deployment strategy of Cloud-Edge-Collaboration is\nlocal execution, which is the same as Edge-Solo.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\nC. Effects of Bandwidth\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe set the source node as AGX Orin and vary the bandwidth\nbetween the cloud server and the source node from 1Mbps to\n50Mbps. The performance of the latency and throughput of\nLLM inference are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively.\nFor Llama2-13B, a single AGX Orin cannot accommodate\nthe full model. We only compare the performance among\nCloud-Edge-Even, Cloud-Edge-Opt, and EdgeShard. Simi-\nlarly, due to the memory constraint, the three baseline methods\nare not able to deploy the Llama2-70B model. Instead, we\ncompare the performance of EdgeShard with its variant, i.e.,\nEdgeShard-Even, where the model is equally partitioned and\ndeployed to all the participating computing devices. It selects\n11 AGX Orin and 1 RTX 3090 to deploy the Llama2-70B\nmodel.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn terms of latency, except for Edge-Solo, the latency of the\nother three methods decreases with the increasing bandwidth.\nThis is because the three methods are collaboration-based,\nand the latency is influenced by the data transmission time.\nThe increasing bandwidth leads to reduced communication\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\ntime. We can also see that for the collaboration methods,\nthere is a dramatically latency reduction when the cloud-\nsource bandwidth changes from 1Mbps to 10Mbps and a\nminor variance from 10Mbps to 50Mbps. This is because\nthe bandwidth is gradually saturated at that time, and the\ncomputation time becomes the bottleneck.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nMoreover, we can see that when the bandwidth is greater\nthan 10Mbps, cloud-edge collaboration methods outperform\nthe Edge-Solo method, as the cloud-edge collaboration meth-\nods introduce the powerful cloud server for computation\nacceleration. However, when the bandwidth is 1Mbps, Cloud-\nEdge-Even performs worse than EdgeSolo. This is because the\ndata transmission cost is high in this case. The Cloud-Edge-\nOpt method tends to deploy the LLM model locally, which is\nthe same as the Edge-Solo method. Interestingly, the latency of\nCloud-Edge-Opt and EdgeShard is nearly the same when the\nbandwidth is greater than 10Mbps. We found that EdgeShard\ngenerates the same model partition and allocation policies as\nthe Cloud-Edge-Opt method. The variance comes from the\nsmall fluctuations in model execution. It shows that the per-\nformance of EdgeShard will not be worse than that of Cloud-\nEdge-Opt, and the Cloud-Edge-Opt method is a special case of\nEdgeShard. A similar pattern is also observed for Llama2-13B.\nFor Llama2-70B, EdgeShard performs better than its variant\nEdgeShard-Even, as there is resource heterogeneity among\ncloud server and edge devices, and EdgeShard adaptively\npartitions the LLMs among computing devices. However, the\nperformance improvement is not so obvious as there are 11\nAGX with the same computation capacity and only 1 RTX\n3090.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn terms of throughput, similar patterns to the latency\nevaluation are also found for Llama2-7B model. Differently\nand interestingly, for Llama2-13B, EdgeShard does not show\na closing performance with the Cloud-Edge-Opt method when\nthe bandwidth is 10Mbps, but with a great\nimprovement,\nwhere EdgeShard has about 2x higher throughput than the\nCloud-Edge-Opt method. This is because of the high memory\nconsumption of the RTX 3090 and the source node,\ni.e.,\nAGX Orin. We observed that for the Cloud-Edge-Opt, the\nmemory consumption of the two devices goes up to 95%\nand 98%, respectively, which only allows for a maximum\nbatch size of 4. Otherwise, there will not be enough memory\nfor the KV cache on the computing devices. However, when\nthe bandwidth is 10Mbps, EdgeShard involves several edge\ndevices where the memory consumption of an individual\ndevice becomes dramatically decreased, allowing for a larger\nbatch size, i.e., 8 in this case. When the bandwidth is higher\nthan 10Mbps, EdgeShards tends to have the same model\npartition and allocation strategy as Cloud-Edge-Opt, which\nyields a closing performance, as shown in Llama2-7B. For\nLlama2-70B,\nimprovement of\nEdgeShard, and EdgeShard-Even shows a steady throughput\nas the evenly partition strategy will not change with the cloud-\nsource bandwidth.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nthere is a slight\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nthroughput\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nD.

We set the source node\nas AGX Orin and Orin NX, respectively, and compare their\nperformance. We set the bandwidth between the source node\nand the cloud server as 1Mbps. The results of Llama2-7B\ninference are shown in Fig. 9.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe find that when the source node is Orin NX, the Edge-\nSolo and Cloud-Edge-Even methods encounter the OOM error.\nThis is due to the relatively lower memory of Orin NX, which\ncannot accommodate the Llama2-7B model, even for half part\nof the model. The difference between the two cases under the\nCloud-Edge-Opt method is much more obvious than that of\nEdgeShard. For Cloud-Edge-Opt, there is about a 60ms gap,\nand for EdgeShard, the gap is about 5ms. This is because there\nare only two devices in the Cloud-Edge-Opt case, and it tends\nto put more layers on the source node. However, AGX Orin is\nmuch more powerful than Orin NX in terms of computation\ncapacity. EdgeShard tends to involve more devices and put\nfewer model layers on the source node, which can fill in\nthe gap in computation capacity between the source nodes. A\nsimilar phenomenon is also observed for the throughput, where\nAGX Orin has 6x higher throughput than Orin Nx for the\nCloud-Edge-Opt method and only 2x higher throughput under\nthe EdgeShard method. It shows EdgeShard can make full use\nof the computation resources in the network to optimize the\nperformance.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nE.

Wang et\nal. [13] increase the throughput by distributing the computa-\ntion between cloud servers and edge devices, and reducing\nthe communication overhead of transmitting the activations\nbetween the central cloud and edge devices by leveraging\nthe low-rank property of residual activations. Chen et al. [14]\nefficiently leverage location-based information of edge devices\nfor personalized prompt completion during collaborative edge-\ncloud LLM serving. However, the latency between edge de-\nvices and the central cloud is usually high and unstable, which\nwill affect the inference and finetuning performance of LLM.\nOur work is different from those works. We propose a\ngeneral framework to integrate the computation resources of\nheterogeneous and ubiquitous cloud servers and edge devices.\nThe framework allows the adaptive selection of computation\ndevices and partition of the computation workload of LLM\ninference for optimized latency and throughput.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\nB. LLM for Optimizing Edge Computing\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nLLMs also have great potential in making complex and\ncoherent decisions. There are also some works that leverage\nLLM to optimize resource utilization in edge computing,\nsuch as resource allocation and task offloading, network man-\nagement, and intelligent IoT control. Li et al. [22] propose\nLAMBO, a LLM-based task offloading framework for mo-\nbile edge computing, to address the challenging issues of\nheterogeneous constraints, partial status perception, diverse\noptimization objectives, and dynamic environment that are not\nwell addressed in traditional task offloading research. LAMBO\nshows that LLM is more effective compared to traditional\nDNN and deep reinforcement learning-based methods in com-\nplex and dynamic edge computing environments. They further\ndesign a LLM-based multi-agent system and incorporate com-\nmunication knowledge and tools into the system, empowering\nit with the ability to optimize semantic communication in\na 6G network [23]. Apart from optimization of resource\nutilization, Shen et al. [24] leverage the outstanding abilities of\nGPT in language understanding and code generation to train\nnew models among federated edge devices. Rong et al. [25]\nleverage LLMs to generate adaptive control algorithms for\naddressing the diverse, dynamic, and decentralized network\nconditions in 6G integrated terrestrial network (TN) and non-\nterrestrial network (NTN). Though LLMs have shown great\npotential in making intelligent decisions, especially in complex\nand dynamic edge computing systems, the related research is\nstill in the early stages. Challenges such as significant resource\nconsumption, latency of decision-making, and uncertainty of\ngenerated decisions need further studies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.6**r== 0.1**\nVII.

To\naddress the issue of memory wall, quantization is widely\nadopted [7]–[12]. GPTQ [8] quantizes LLM with hundreds of\nbillions of parameters to 3-4bits based on approximate second-\norder information. Lin et al. [10] reduce quantization error by\noptimizing channel scaling to preserve the salient important\nweights. They are weight-only quantization. SmoothQuant\n[11] and Agile-Quant [7] take a further step, which quantize\nnot only the model weights, but also the model activations.\nHowever, the computation capacity and memory of a single\ndevice is still limited even for quantized LLM. Moreover, the\nperformance of quantized LLM usually cannot be compared\nto that of its full-size model.\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n[5] W.

         " the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted widespread attention from the industry, and academia, representing a significant public, breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI). Many players are coming into this field with their advanced models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 [1], Meta’s Llama [2], and Google’s PALM [3]. Built on the foundation of transformer architecture [4], LLMs are characterized by their massive scale in terms of the number of parameters and the amount of data they are trained on. The scale of LLMs, often numbering in hundreds of billions of parameters, enables the models to capture complex patterns in language and context, making them highly effective at generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Such a phenomenon is also known as ”intelligence emergence”. The outstanding capability of LLMs makes them valuable and well-performed in a wide range of applications, from ChatBot and content generation (e.g., text summation and code generation) to assisting tools of education and research. However, current LLMs heavily rely on cloud computing, suffering from long response time, high bandwidth cost, and privacy concerns [5]. Firstly, the reliance on cloud computing hampers the capability for rapid model inference necessary for   images, audio, and IoT sensing data,   real-time applications such as robotics control, navigation, or exploration, where immediate responses are crucial. Secondly, the transmission of large amounts of data, including texts, to the cloud video, data centers leads to substantial bandwidth consumption and immense strain on the network architecture. Thirdly, cloud- based LLMs raise significant privacy issues, especially when handling sensitive data of hospitals and banks, as well as personal data like text inputs and photos on mobile phones.   Edge computing is a promising solution to address the afore- mentioned challenges by deploying LLMs on edge devices (e.g., edge servers, edge gateways, and mobile phones) at the network edge closer to the data sources [6]. However, LLMs are computation-intensive and resource-greedy. For example, the inference of a full-precision Llama2-7B model requires at least 28GB memory, which may exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Some works leverage model quantization [7]– [12] to reduce the model size to fit into the resource-constraint edge devices. However, they often lead to accuracy loss. Other works tend to use cloud-edge collaboration [13], [14], which partitions the LLMs into two sub-models and offloads part of the computation workload to the powerful cloud servers with high-end GPUs. However, the latency between edge devices and cloud servers is usually high and unstable.   Alternatively, we have witnessed the continuous growth of the computing power of edge in recent years, and a large number of edge servers and edge clouds have been deployed at the network edge, leaving significant resources to be used. Collaborative edge computing (CEC) [15], [16] is hence proposed recently to integrate the computing re-   sources of geo-distributed edge devices and cloud servers for efficient resource utilization and performance optimization. As shown in Fig. 1, ubiquitous and distributed edge devices and cloud servers are connected and form a shared resource pool, collaboratively providing instant data processing and AI services. CEC is different from existing edge computing research. Existing edge computing research focuses on the vertical collaboration among cloud, edge, and end devices, while neglecting horizontal edge-to-edge collaborations, suf- fering from unoptimized resource utilization, restricted service coverage, and uneven performance.   Motivated by the vision of CEC, we propose a general LLM inference framework, named EdgeShard, to support efficient collaborative LLM inference on distributed edge devices and cloud servers. For simplicity, we use computing devices below to refer to edge devices and cloud servers. Given a network with heterogeneous computing devices, EdgeShard partitions the LLM into multiple shards and allocates them to judicious devices based on the heterogeneous computation and network- ing resources, as well as the memory budget of devices. To optimize performance, we formulate a joint device selection and model partition problem and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the inference latency and maximize the inference throughput, respectively. Extensive ex- periments on a practical testbed show that EdgeShard reduces up to 50% latency and achieves 2x throughput over on-device and vertical cloud-edge collaborative inference methods.   Our work is different from those works that partition the LLMs and allocate to multiple GPUs in cloud data centers, such as Gpipe [17] and PipeDream [18]. Deploying LLM at edge computing is vastly different from that in the cloud. First, cloud servers are usually with homogeneous GPUs, while edge devices are with heterogeneous computation ca- pabilities in nature. Second, modern cloud GPUs for LLMs are usually connected by high-bandwidth networks, such as InfiniBand and Nvlinks, while edge devices are connected with heterogeneous and low-bandwidth networks. For example, the bandwidth of NVlinks can go up to 600GB/s, while the bandwidth among edge devices ranges from dozens of Kbps to 1000Mbps. The solution of LLMs deployment designed for cloud data centers neglect the heterogeneous and resource- constrained edge computing environment.   Our contributions are three folds.   • First, we propose a general LLM inference framework for deploying LLMs in the edge computing environment, which enables the collaborative inference among hetero- geneous edge devices and cloud servers.   • Further, we quantitatively study how to select computing devices and how to partition the LLM for optimized performance. We mathematically formulate a joint device selection and model partition problem, and propose a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the latency and throughput, respectively.   • We also evaluate the performance of EdgeShard with state-of-the-art Llama2 serial models on a physical testbed. Experimental results show EdgeShard remark- ably outperforms various baseline methods.   Generative LLM Inference. LLMs generally refer to decoder-based transformer models with billions of parameters. Different from encoder-based architecture like BERT [19], whose inference process is single phase, the process of LLM inference is iterative and typically involves two phases: the prompt processing phase and the autoregressive generation. The prompt processing phase is also known as prefill.   In the prompt processing phase, the model takes the user initial token (x1, ..., xn) as input and generates the first new to- ken xn+1 by computing the probability P (xn+1 | x1, ..., xn). In the autoregressive generation phase, the model generates one token at a time, based on both the initial input and the tokens it has generated so far. This phase generates tokens sequentially for multiple iterations until a stopping criterion is met, i.e., either when generating an end-of-sequence (EOS) token or reaching the maximum number of tokens specified by user or constrained by the LLM.   the model   As shown in Fig. 2, suppose the LLM model has N layers, which will take a sequence of input tokens and run all layers to generate a token in a one-by-one manner. In the prefill phase, takes the input (”Today is a”) at once, and the first generated token is ”good.” In the autoregressvie generation phase, the model first takes (”Today is a good”) as input and generates the next token (”day”). It then takes (”Today is a good day”) as input and generates the next token (”EOS”), which indicates the end of the generation. Since a token generated is determined by all its previous token in a sequence, LLMs utilize Key-Value caching (KV caching) to avoid repetitive computation, storing past computations to expedite responses, thereby reducing computational workload and improving response times. The time to generate a token   in the prefill stage is much higher (usually 10x) than that of in the autoregressive stage, as the prefill stage needs to calculate the KV cahche of all input tokens as initialization.   least 28GB memory, but   LLMs are memory-consuming. A single edge device may not have sufficient memory to accommodate a LLM model. Take one of the most popular LLM models, i.e., Llama2, as an example. As shown in Table. I, Llama2 has three different versions, i.e., 7B, 13B, and 70B. We can see from the Table that the full precision inference of Llama2-7B requires the smartphones usually only at have 6-12 GB memory, and the Jetson Orin NX has 8-16 GB memory. They are unable to burden the on-device LLM inference. Some works try to use low-precision quantization, e.g., 8 bit and 4 bit. However, it may still exceed the memory capacity of edge devices. For example, the 4-bit inference of Llama2-70B requires at least 35GB memory, which cannot be accommodated on most edge devices. Moreover, low-precision inference leads to performance degradation.   In this work, we leverage collaborative edge computing, a computing paradigm where geo-distributed edge devices and cloud servers collaborate to perform computational tasks. Based on that idea, we propose EdgeShard, a general LLM inference framework that allows adaptive device selection and LLM partition over distributed computing devices, to address the high memory requirements and leverage heterogeneous resources to optimize LLM inference.   There are three stages of the framework, including profiling, task scheduling optimization, and collaborative inference. The workflow is shown in Fig. 3.   Profiling is an offline step that profiles the necessary run- time traces for the optimization step and only needs to be done once. Those traces include: 1) the execution time of each layer on different devices; 2) the size of activations and memory consumption for each layer of the LLM model; 3) available memory of each device and the bandwidth among devices. For the execution time of each layer, we profile the time to generate a token in the prefill stage and autoregressive stage, respectively, and take the average. For those devices   that may not have efficient memory to hold the full model for performing the profiling, we utilize a dynamic model loading technology, where the model layers are consecutively loaded to fit the constrained memory. The profiling information will then be used to support intelligent task scheduling strategies. Scheduling Optimization. At the task scheduling optimiza- tion stage, the scheduler generates a deployment strategy by determining which device to participate in, how to partition the LLM model in a layer wise, and which device should the model shard be allocated to. The strategy thoroughly considers the heterogeneous resources, the memory budget of devices, and the privacy constraint, and later be applied to selected devices for efficient LLM inference. More details is described in Sec. IV.   Collaborative inference. After getting the LLM model par- tition and allocation strategy, the selected devices will perform the collaborative inference. We pre-allocate memory space for KV cache on each participating device. We consider two cases for the collaborative inference, i.e., sequential inference and pipeline parallel inference.   In sequential inference, devices take turns to perform the computation with the allocated model shards. As shown in Fig. 4(a), suppose the LLM model is partitioned into 3 shards and allocated to device 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Device 1 will first process the input data and then send the activations/out- puts to device 2, which will process the data and then transmit to device 3. Sequential inference is suitable for serving a single user, such as in smart home scenario, where users’ personal devices (e.g., tablet, phones, and smart speaker) collaborate to perform LLM inference. In such scenario, user inputs a prompt   and gets the response and then input another prompt. We aims to minimize the latency of sequential inference.   However, sequential inference is not resource-efficient from the system’s perspective. When device 1 is performing com- putation, device 2 and device 3 are idle. We thus take pipeline parallelism to improve resource utilization. For the pipeline parallel inference as taken in previous work Gpipe [17] and PipeDream [18] for cloud servers, the input data will first be split into micro-batch and subsequently feed into the system. As depicted in Fig. 4(b), device 1 first handles data B1 and then transmits intermediate data to device 2. After handling data B1, device 1 immediately goes to handle data B2. In such a pipeline manner, every device is busy with high system resource utilization.   We consider a general collaborative edge network with het- erogeneous devices and bandwidth connection. More specif- ically, given a set of heterogeneous devices connected with heterogeneous bandwidth, EdgeShard aims to select a subset of devices and partition the LLM into shards, which will be allocated to the selected devices to minimize the inference latency or maximize the throughput.   System Model. LLMs usually have a layered architecture, which consists of an embedding layer, multiple decoder layer, and an output layer. Sizes of parameters and activations (i.e., the output of a layer) vary across layers. We assume the model is with N layers. Oi represents the size of activations of layer i, 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1. The memory consumption of a layer i is denoted by Reqi.   We consider a network consisting of M edge devices and cloud servers. The devices have heterogeneous computation and memory capabilities, and cloud servers are much more powerful than edge devices in terms of computation capability. The memory budget of a device j is M emj. The computing devices are interconnected. Bandwidth between a device k and a device j is Bk,j, 0 ≤ k ≤ M − 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ M − 1. There is a source node where the input tokens reside. Without loss of generality, we set the source node as node 0. The main notations used in this paper are shown in Table. II.   A. Optimize LLM inference latency   Problem Formulation. We use a binary variable Xi,j to denote the LLM allocation strategy. Xi,j equals to 1 if layer   j=0 Xi,j = 1, ∀i. Let ti,j   i is allocated to node j. Otherwise, Xi,j equals to zero. A layer will be and only be allocated to one node. Hence, we have M −1 comp denotes the computation time of layer i on node j. Suppose layer i − 1 and layer i are allocated to node k and node j, respectively. We use ti−1,k,j comm to denote the communication time to transmit the activations of layer i − 1 from node k to node j. The data transmission time is determined by the output size of a layer and the bandwidth between two nodes. If layer i − 1 and layer i are on the same node, we assume the transmission time is zero. Hence, we have   otherwise.   The total   inference time can thus be calculated by the   following equation.   (2) the problem of minimizing the LLM inference latency can be formulated as follows, where Eq. (4) is the privacy constraint. It shows that the first layer of the LLM model should always be allocated to node 0, which is set to be the source node with input tokens. In such a case, the raw input data resides on the source node and avoids to be transmitted among computing devices. Eq. (5) shows that the memory requirements of all the layers allocated to node j cannot exceed its memory budget.   min Ttol   Xi,j ∗ Reqi ≤ M emj   Solution. To minimize the inference latency, we design a dynamic programming algorithm. The intuition is that the minimal execution time of the first i layer is determined by the first i − 1 layer, which means the optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal results of the sub-problems. It has the optimal sub-problem property, which motivates us to use dynamic programming.   Let DP (i, j) denote the minimal total execution time of the first i layers after the layer i is allocated to the node j. The state transition equation is formulated as:   (DP (i − 1, k) + ti,j   (DP (i − 1, k) + ti,j   (6) Where DP (i − 1, k) indicates the minimal execution time of the first i − 1 layers if layer i − 1 is allocated to device k. Eq. (6) shows that DP (i, j) is determined by traversing at all possible nodes of the previous layer and choosing the one that   minimizes the execution time of the first i layers. Moreover, due to the autogressive nature of LLM, the generated token needs to be sent back to the source node for next iteration of generation. Hence, for the last layer N −1, the communication time not only includes the data transmission time from the N − 2 layer, but also the transmission time to the source node tN −1,j,0 comm . Additionally, we initialize DP (0, 0) as shown in Eq. (7) by considering the privacy constraint.   Algorithm 1: Joint device selection and LLM partition for optimizing latency Input: A LLM model; Computing device M ; Profiled   traces; bandwidth Bk,j;   Output: the device selection and LLM partition   strategy // initialization   1 Initialize DP table DP (i, j) = IN F , and choice table   choice(i, j) = N U LL to record the strategy; 2 Enforce first layer to be allocated to node 0 by   By traversing each layer and each node based on Eq. (6), we can fill in the dynamic programming table DP (i, j) to track the minimum total execution time to reach each layer. Finally, the minimal total execution time at the last layer can be calculated by Eq. (8). We can then get the optimal node allocation for each layer by backtracking DP (i, j).   minj=0,...,M −1(DP (N − 1, j))   This method is simple and effective. With dynamic pro- gramming, we can quickly traverse the solution space and find the best LLM partition and allocation strategy. The algorithm to find the optimal LLM partition and allocation strategy for minimizing inference latency is shown in Algo. 1.   In Algo. 1, we first initialize the dynamic programming table DP (i, j) and choice table choice(i, j) (lines 1-2). We initialize DP (0, 0) according to Eq. (7). The choice(i, j) records the node k to host the i − 1 layer. It is the optimal variable of Eq. (6). We then traverse the layers of the large language model from layer 1. For each layer, we traverse all the computing devices with sufficient memory and calculate the inference time (lines 3-19). After filling the DP table, we can find the minimal DP (N − 1, j), which represents the minimal time for executing the LLM model, and the last node to host layer N − 1. Finally, by backtracing choice(i, j), we get the model partition and allocation strategy R (lines 20-28). The computational complexity of Algo. 1 is O(N × M × M ), where N is the number of layers of the LLM model and M is the number of devices in the network.   B. Optimize LLM inference throughput   Problem Formulation. For optimizing throughput, pipeline parallelism is adopted to avoid device idleness. As illustrated before, the computation time of layer i on node j is ti,j comp, and if layer i to layer m are all allocated to node j, the computation time is indicated by ti→m,j comp . The data transmission time of the activations of layer i − 1 from node k to node j is ti−1,k,j comm . In pipeline parallel inference, the computation time and communication time can be overlapped to maximize the throughput. Thus, for the inference task, the maximum latency for the device j can be calculated as:   Ideally, for the selected devices, achieving the maximal to minimizing the latency of the throughput slowest device. We use S to denote the selected devices, and   is equivalent   DP (0, 0) = t0,0 // fill in the DP table   comp and choice(0, 0) = 0;   3 for i = 1 to N − 1 do   for j = 0 to M − 1 do   if M emj ≤ Reqi then   end else   for k = 0 to M − 1 do   Calculate the total execution time by Eq. (6) and assign it to ttotal; if ttotal ≤ DP (i, j) then   Update DP (i, j) by assigning DP (i, j) = ttotal; Update memory M emj; Record allocation plan choice(i, j) = k;   // backtrace for allocation strategy   20 Initialize optimal strategy R; 21 Find the last selected node   Nlast = argminj(DP (N − 1, j));   Find the previous node Nlast = choice(i, Nlast); Add Nlast to R;   22 Add Nlast to R; 23 for i = N − 1 to 0 do   26 end 27 Reverse R; 28 return R;   then the problem of maximizing the inference throughput can thus be formulated as follows, where j ∈ S.   Solution. Similar to minimizing the inference latency, the problem of maximizing the throughput also has an optimal sub-problem property. Maximizing the throughput of the first i layer can be deduced from solving the problem of allocating the first i−1 layer, which indicates that the optimal solution of the whole problem can be constructed from the sub-problems. We also use dynamic programming to solve the problem.   Let g(i, S, k) denote the minimum time to process the first i layers with the set of used devices S, and the device k is the last node to be used, k ∈ S. We use g(m, S′, j) to denote the next state to process the first m layers with the set of used devices S′, and the device j is the last node to be used, where 0 ≤ i < m ≤ N − 1, j ∈ M \\ S, S′ = S ∪ {j}.   The state transition equation is formulated in Eq. is determined by the previous   (11), where g(m, S′, j) state g(i, S, k), and the maximum latency of devive j, i.e., the com- putation time ti−1,k,j comp . The final optimal solution T opt throu is the minimum g(N − 1, S′, j), where S′ ⊆ M .   comm and the communication time ti→m,j   Algorithm 2: Joint device selection and LLM partition for optimizing throughput Input: A LLM model; Computing devices M ; Profiled   traces; bandwidth Bk,j;   Output: the device selection and LLM partition   strategy R   // initialization   1 Initialize DP table g(i, S, k) = IN F , and choice table choice(m, S, j) = N U LL to record the strategy;   2 Enforce first layer to be allocated to node 0 by   g(1, 1, 0) = t0,0 // fill in DP table   comp and choice(1, 1, 0) = (0, 0, 0);   g(m, S′, j) S′=S∪{j}   Additionally, we have constraints when performing state transition. They are the memory constraint shown in Eq. (12) and privacy constraint in Eq. (13).   Reqi→m ≤ M emj   Algo. 2 describes the pseudo-code to find the optimal solu- tion T opt throu and the corresponding model partition and alloca- tion strategy. In Algo. 2, we first initialize the dynamic pro- gramming table g(m, S′, j) and choice table choice(m, S, j), and assign t0,0 comp to g(1, 1, 0) (lines 1-2). We then traverse the layers of the large language model from layer 1. For each layer, we traverse all the computing devices with sufficient memory and calculate the maximum latency (lines 3-23). After filling the DP table, we can find the maximum latency, based on which we then backtrace the choice table and finally get the model partition and allocation strategy (lines 24-32). The computational complexity of Algo. 2 is O(N 2 × 2M × M 2), where N is the number of layers of the LLM model and M is the number devices in the network.   Pipeline Execution Optimization. Note that   the above problem formulation and solution are based on the ideal case, where there is no idle device at any time. A device processes a batch of data and continues to handle another batch of data without waiting. However, it is impractical for LLM inference in real-world cases.   As shown in Fig. 5(a), different from those one-phase computation applications, the decoder-based LLM application has an autoregressive nature, where there will be multiple tokens to be generated and the calculation of the current token relies on all the previous tokens. The computation of the current token cannot start until it gets the previously generated token. It leads to bubbles in pipeline execution.   To approximate the ideal case and enhance the resource utilization for improving throughput, we tend to reduce the bubbles in the pipeline execution. We propose EdgeShard-No- bubbles, which allows for immediate token generation without waiting for the ending of all micro-batches in an iteration. As shown in Fig. 5(b), after the prefill stage P 1 ends of the first batch, Device 1 immediately executes the token generation of   3 for i = 1 to N − 1 do   for each subset S ⊆ M do for last node k ∈ S do   for m = i + 1 to N − 1 do for j ∈ M \\ S do   if M emj ≤ m Continue;   i Reqi then   end else   Get S′ by adding node j to the selected device set S; Calculate current mamixum execution time Tmax via Eq. (11) for the maximum execution time in all stages;   end if Tmax ≤ g(i, S, k) then g(m, S′, j) = Tmax; Record the current strategy choice(m, S′, j) = (i, j, k);   // backtrace for optimal allocation   24 Initialize optimal strategy R; 25 Find selected device set S and the last selected node Nlast by S, Nlast = argminS,k(g(N − 1, S, k));   26 Initialize layer = N − 1; 27 while layer > 0 do   (i, j, k) = choice(layer, S, Nlast); Add (i → layer, j) to R; Update layer, S and Nlast;   31 end 32 return R;   the first batch as indicated by G1A. Similarly, when G1A ends, Device 1 goes to the next iteration of token generation indi- cated by G1B. Compared to EdgeShard-Bubbles, EdgeShard- No-bubbles reduces bubbles by mitigating device idle time and is expected to improve throughput. From the pipeline execution graph in Fig. 5, we can see that EdgeShard-No-   2023 and is one of the most popular and powerful open- source large language models, representing a groundbreaking leap in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. For the model inference, we adopt the text gen- eration task to test the performance. We use the WikiText-2 dataset [21] from HuggingFace. We extract a subset of samples with the length of input tokens as 32 and generate 96 tokens. We use full-precision model inference in all the following experiments.   Baselines. We compare the performance in terms of latency and throughput of EdgeShard with various baselines. (We don’t use the cloud-only as a baseline because it requires the input token to be transmitted to the cloud server, which may lead to privacy concerns).   • Edge-Solo. In this case, the LLMs are deployed locally   on an edge device without model partition.   • Cloud-Edge-Even. In this case, the LLMs are evenly partitioned into two parts. One is allocated to the edge device, and another is allocated to the cloud server. • Cloud-Edge-Opt. In this case, the LLMs are partitioned into two shards. One is allocated to the edge device, and another is allocated to the cloud server. For the partition strategy of LLMs, we also use the proposed dynamic programming algorithms. The difference is that there is only two devices as the algorithm input.   We set AGX Orin as the source node and the bandwidth between the source node and the cloud server as 1Mbps. The bandwidth between other computing devices is set to be 50Mbps with a variance of 20%. To test the throughput, we set the batch size as the maximum batch size that the participating devices can support. The latency and throughput of LLM inference are shown in Table. IV.   bubbles generates more tokens at the same time.   Testbed. We use various edge devices and cloud servers to act as the heterogeneous computation devices in collaborative edge computing. The specifications of those devices are listed in Table. III. We use 15 devices, including 12 Jetson AGX Orin, 2 Jetson Orin NX, and one cloud server to configure the collaborative edge network. The physical testbed is shown in Fig. 6. Those devices are connected with a route and a switch. The bandwidth between any two devices is 1000Mbps. We use the Linux TC tool [20] to vary network bandwidth and communication latency between devices.   Benchmarks. We test the performance of EdgeShard with a series of Llama2 models [2], including Llama2-7B, Llama2- 13B, and Llama2-70B. Llama2 is released by Meta in July   We have the following observations. First, EdgeShard is potential and beneficial for large language model deployment. For Llama2-70B model, the memory requirement is about   280GB, which far exceeds the memory capacity of solo edge deployment and cloud-edge collaborative deployment. They will have the out-of-memory issue (OOM). However, Edge- Shard tackles this challenge by splitting the large model into shards and allocating them to multiple devices, enabling col- laborative model inference. Second, EdgeShard achieves obvi- ously lower inference latency and higher inference throughput than baseline methods. For Llama2-7B model, EdgeShard achieves 75.88ms latency, which is about 1.85x faster than Edge-Solo and Cloud-Edge-Opt, and about 3x faster than Cloud-Edge-Even. For the inference throughput, EdgeShard achieves 52.45 tokens per second with a maximum batch size of 8, which is around 2.2 times larger than Edge-Solo and Cloud-Edge-Opt, and about 7 times larger than Cloud-Edge- is also observed Even. Similar performance improvement for Llama2-13B model, where EdgeShard achieves 45.7% and 28.8% lower latency than Cloud-Edge-Even and Cloud- Edge-Opt, respectively. Also, EdgeShard has 2.23x and 2.2x higher throughput than Cloud-Edge-Even and Cloud-Edge- Opt. Third, we can also see that, for Llama2-7B, Cloud-Edge- Opt tends to have the same performance in terms of both inference latency and throughput as Edge-Solo. This is because the bandwidth between the source node and the cloud server is very limited in this experimental setting, i.e., 1Mbps. The   optimal deployment strategy of Cloud-Edge-Collaboration is local execution, which is the same as Edge-Solo.   C. Effects of Bandwidth   We set the source node as AGX Orin and vary the bandwidth between the cloud server and the source node from 1Mbps to 50Mbps. The performance of the latency and throughput of LLM inference are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively. For Llama2-13B, a single AGX Orin cannot accommodate the full model. We only compare the performance among Cloud-Edge-Even, Cloud-Edge-Opt, and EdgeShard. Simi- larly, due to the memory constraint, the three baseline methods are not able to deploy the Llama2-70B model. Instead, we compare the performance of EdgeShard with its variant, i.e., EdgeShard-Even, where the model is equally partitioned and deployed to all the participating computing devices. It selects 11 AGX Orin and 1 RTX 3090 to deploy the Llama2-70B model.   In terms of latency, except for Edge-Solo, the latency of the other three methods decreases with the increasing bandwidth. This is because the three methods are collaboration-based, and the latency is influenced by the data transmission time. The increasing bandwidth leads to reduced communication   time. We can also see that for the collaboration methods, there is a dramatically latency reduction when the cloud- source bandwidth changes from 1Mbps to 10Mbps and a minor variance from 10Mbps to 50Mbps. This is because the bandwidth is gradually saturated at that time, and the computation time becomes the bottleneck.   Moreover, we can see that when the bandwidth is greater than 10Mbps, cloud-edge collaboration methods outperform the Edge-Solo method, as the cloud-edge collaboration meth- ods introduce the powerful cloud server for computation acceleration. However, when the bandwidth is 1Mbps, Cloud- Edge-Even performs worse than EdgeSolo. This is because the data transmission cost is high in this case. The Cloud-Edge- Opt method tends to deploy the LLM model locally, which is the same as the Edge-Solo method. Interestingly, the latency of Cloud-Edge-Opt and EdgeShard is nearly the same when the bandwidth is greater than 10Mbps. We found that EdgeShard generates the same model partition and allocation policies as the Cloud-Edge-Opt method. The variance comes from the small fluctuations in model execution. It shows that the per- formance of EdgeShard will not be worse than that of Cloud- Edge-Opt, and the Cloud-Edge-Opt method is a special case of EdgeShard. A similar pattern is also observed for Llama2-13B. For Llama2-70B, EdgeShard performs better than its variant EdgeShard-Even, as there is resource heterogeneity among cloud server and edge devices, and EdgeShard adaptively partitions the LLMs among computing devices. However, the performance improvement is not so obvious as there are 11 AGX with the same computation capacity and only 1 RTX 3090.   In terms of throughput, similar patterns to the latency evaluation are also found for Llama2-7B model. Differently and interestingly, for Llama2-13B, EdgeShard does not show a closing performance with the Cloud-Edge-Opt method when the bandwidth is 10Mbps, but with a great improvement, where EdgeShard has about 2x higher throughput than the Cloud-Edge-Opt method. This is because of the high memory consumption of the RTX 3090 and the source node, i.e., AGX Orin. We observed that for the Cloud-Edge-Opt, the memory consumption of the two devices goes up to 95% and 98%, respectively, which only allows for a maximum batch size of 4. Otherwise, there will not be enough memory for the KV cache on the computing devices. However, when the bandwidth is 10Mbps, EdgeShard involves several edge devices where the memory consumption of an individual device becomes dramatically decreased, allowing for a larger batch size, i.e., 8 in this case. When the bandwidth is higher than 10Mbps, EdgeShards tends to have the same model partition and allocation strategy as Cloud-Edge-Opt, which yields a closing performance, as shown in Llama2-7B. For Llama2-70B, improvement of EdgeShard, and EdgeShard-Even shows a steady throughput as the evenly partition strategy will not change with the cloud- source bandwidth.   there is a slight   throughput   D. Effects of Source Node   different computation and memory capacities, and EdgeShard enforces the first layer of LLM models residing on the source node to avoid raw data transmission. We set the source node as AGX Orin and Orin NX, respectively, and compare their performance. We set the bandwidth between the source node and the cloud server as 1Mbps. The results of Llama2-7B inference are shown in Fig. 9.   We find that when the source node is Orin NX, the Edge- Solo and Cloud-Edge-Even methods encounter the OOM error. This is due to the relatively lower memory of Orin NX, which cannot accommodate the Llama2-7B model, even for half part of the model. The difference between the two cases under the Cloud-Edge-Opt method is much more obvious than that of EdgeShard. For Cloud-Edge-Opt, there is about a 60ms gap, and for EdgeShard, the gap is about 5ms. This is because there are only two devices in the Cloud-Edge-Opt case, and it tends to put more layers on the source node. However, AGX Orin is much more powerful than Orin NX in terms of computation capacity. EdgeShard tends to involve more devices and put fewer model layers on the source node, which can fill in the gap in computation capacity between the source nodes. A similar phenomenon is also observed for the throughput, where AGX Orin has 6x higher throughput than Orin Nx for the Cloud-Edge-Opt method and only 2x higher throughput under the EdgeShard method. It shows EdgeShard can make full use of the computation resources in the network to optimize the performance.   E. Effects of Pipeline Execution strategy   We evaluate the two pipeline execution strategies. We set the bandwidth between the cloud server and the source node as 1Mbps. The results are shown in Fig. 10.   We also test   the influence of the source node on the inference latency and throughput, as the source node may have   We can see that for all methods, EdgeShard-No-bubble outperforms EdgeShard-Bubble. Specifically, for Llama2-7b,   Other works [13], [14] tend to leverage the cloud-edge collaboration to partition and distribute the massive compu- tation workload of LLM inference and finetuning. Wang et al. [13] increase the throughput by distributing the computa- tion between cloud servers and edge devices, and reducing the communication overhead of transmitting the activations between the central cloud and edge devices by leveraging the low-rank property of residual activations. Chen et al. [14] efficiently leverage location-based information of edge devices for personalized prompt completion during collaborative edge- cloud LLM serving. However, the latency between edge de- vices and the central cloud is usually high and unstable, which will affect the inference and finetuning performance of LLM. Our work is different from those works. We propose a general framework to integrate the computation resources of heterogeneous and ubiquitous cloud servers and edge devices. The framework allows the adaptive selection of computation devices and partition of the computation workload of LLM inference for optimized latency and throughput.   B. LLM for Optimizing Edge Computing   LLMs also have great potential in making complex and coherent decisions. There are also some works that leverage LLM to optimize resource utilization in edge computing, such as resource allocation and task offloading, network man- agement, and intelligent IoT control. Li et al. [22] propose LAMBO, a LLM-based task offloading framework for mo- bile edge computing, to address the challenging issues of heterogeneous constraints, partial status perception, diverse optimization objectives, and dynamic environment that are not well addressed in traditional task offloading research. LAMBO shows that LLM is more effective compared to traditional DNN and deep reinforcement learning-based methods in com- plex and dynamic edge computing environments. They further design a LLM-based multi-agent system and incorporate com- munication knowledge and tools into the system, empowering it with the ability to optimize semantic communication in a 6G network [23]. Apart from optimization of resource utilization, Shen et al. [24] leverage the outstanding abilities of GPT in language understanding and code generation to train new models among federated edge devices. Rong et al. [25] leverage LLMs to generate adaptive control algorithms for addressing the diverse, dynamic, and decentralized network conditions in 6G integrated terrestrial network (TN) and non- terrestrial network (NTN). Though LLMs have shown great potential in making intelligent decisions, especially in complex and dynamic edge computing systems, the related research is still in the early stages. Challenges such as significant resource consumption, latency of decision-making, and uncertainty of generated decisions need further studies.   This section discusses some open issues and future works   that may appeal to readers.   Incentive mechanisms. In this work, we partition the LLM into multiple shards and allocate them to heterogeneous devices. For edge computing scenarios, such as smart home   EdgeShard-No-bubble achieves an improvement of about 0.36 and 6.96 tokens per second than Edgeshard-bubble for Cloud- Edge-Even and EdgeShard, respectively. For the Cloud-Edge- Opt method, it selects local execution in this case. There is no pipeline execution, so the throughput for the two methods is the same. For Llama2-13b, EdgeShard-No-bubble achieves an improvement of about 1.69, 1.89, and 5.21 tokens per second than Edgeshard-Bubble for Cloud-Edge-Even, Cloud-Edge, and EdgeShard, respectively. Compared to EdgeShard-Bubble, EdgeShard-No-bubble does not need to wait for the completion of all micro-batches in an iteration and can effectively reduce the devices’ idle time, thus leading to a higher throughput.   This section reviews research works of LLM in the edge computing environment from two aspects, i.e., edge computing for efficient LLM deployment and LLM for optimizing edge computing.   A. Edge Computing for Efficient LLM   LLM is computation-intensive and memory-consuming. To address the issue of memory wall, quantization is widely adopted [7]–[12]. GPTQ [8] quantizes LLM with hundreds of billions of parameters to 3-4bits based on approximate second- order information. Lin et al. [10] reduce quantization error by optimizing channel scaling to preserve the salient important weights. They are weight-only quantization. SmoothQuant [11] and Agile-Quant [7] take a further step, which quantize not only the model weights, but also the model activations. However, the computation capacity and memory of a single device is still limited even for quantized LLM. Moreover, the performance of quantized LLM usually cannot be compared to that of its full-size model.   and smart factory, there is a set of trusted devices owned by a single stakeholder. They may be able to use those devices for collaborative inference. However, if the devices belong to different stakeholders, they may not be willing to share devices’ computation resources. Further incentive mechanisms are needed to reward resource sharing.   Batch size aware optimization. Large batch size will increase memory usage and affect the inference throughput. As shown in the experiment, by partitioning the workload of LLM inference to multiple devices, the memory usage of participating devices can be reduced and thus allows for a larger batch size, leading to increased throughput. However, the designed dynamic programming algorithm does not con- sider the influence of batch size, which remains space for further optimization.   In this work, we propose EdgeShard to enable the efficient deployment and distributed inference of LLMs on collabo- rative edge devices and cloud servers. We formulate a joint device selection and model partition problem to optimize in- ference latency and throughput, respectively, and solve it using dynamic programming algorithms. Experimental results show that edgesplit can adaptively determine the LLM partition and deployment strategy under various heterogeneous network conditions for optimizing inference performance. Edgeshard is not designed to replace cloud-based LLM inference, but to provide a flexible and adaptive LLM serving methods by utilizing ubiquitous computing devices. Experiments also shows that EdgeShard outperforms the cloud-edge collabora- tive inference method when cloud bandwidth is insufficient and tends to yield the same deployment strategy as the cloud- edge collaborative inference method when facing relatively abundant cloud bandwidth.   This is a pioneering work of deploying LLM in collaborative edge computing environment. We hope this work can stimulate more ideas and further research in this promising area.

Introduction\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nLet X be a smooth, projective curve over a number ﬁeld K of genus g(X)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\n2. Suppose that\nE of degree d for some elliptic curve E. Then X is said to be bielliptic,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nthere is a map φ : X\ntrielliptic, and tetraelliptic if d = 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor a positive integer N , the modular curve X1(N ) (with cusps removed) parametrizes iso-\nmorphism classes of pairs (E, P ), where E is an elliptic curve and P a torsion point of order N\non E.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe ﬁrst author and Kim [JK] determined all bielliptic curves X1(N ). Recently, the author [J]\ndetermined all trielliptic curves X1(N ) over Q, i.e. they admit Q-rational trielliptic maps from\nX1(N ) to elliptic curves E over Q of degree 3. Also he construct explicit Q-rational trielliptic\nmaps from trielliptic X1(N ) over Q to elliptic curves. Interestingly, he rediscovered the Najman’s\nelliptic curve labelled 162B1 over Q(ζ9)+ which is an elliptic curve over a cubic number ﬁeld\nwith torsion Z/21Z in constructing a trielliptic map from X1(21) to an elliptic curve. Indeed,\nthe elliptic curve 162B1 corresponds to a sporadic point on X1(21) of degree 3. In general, a\npoint on X1(N ) is called a point of degree n if it is deﬁned over a number ﬁeld of degree n over\nQ. In particular, we call a point of degree 4 a quartic point.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn this paper, we determine all tetraelliptic modular curves X1(N ) over Q, and ﬁnd some\ntetraelliptic maps φN from tetraelliptic X1(N ) to elliptic curves for those tetraelliptic X1(N ).\nAlso we will construct φN explicitly as rational functions. Constructing explicit expressions of\nmaps from an algebraic curve with a high genus to an elliptic curve seems to be very meaningful\nfrom a computational point of view. At least the author could not ﬁnd any literature showing\nthese explicit expressions except for the author’s previous work [J]. Moreover, we could show\nthat all φN we found are Galois and ﬁnd elliptic curves with torsion subgroup Z/17Z over cyclic\nquartic number ﬁelds by using the cyclic map φ17.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nOur main theorem is as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nof Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2019R1F1A1060149, 2022R1A2C1010487).\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n2020 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation: 11G18, 11G30\nKeywords: tetraelliptic modular curves; tetraelliptic maps\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nTheorem 1.1. X1(N ) is tetraelliptic over Q if and only if N = 17, 20, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32. More-\nover, they all have Q-rational Galois tetraelliptic maps, i.e. they admit Q-rational Galois maps\nof degree 4 from X1(N ) to elliptic curves. Especially, they are cyclic for N = 17, 20, 26, 30 and\n32, and the others are not.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nWe would like to make a few additional comments on the torsion subgroups of elliptic curves.\nAs is well known, Mazur [M] determined all possible group structures of the torsion subgroups\nof elliptic curves over Q. Kamienny [K], Kenku and Momose [KM] completed the same work as\nMazur over quadratic number ﬁelds.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAfter these results, attention shifted toward number ﬁelds of higher degrees. Jeon, Kim and\nSchweizer [JKS1] found all the torsion groups that appear inﬁnitely often as one runs through\nall elliptic curves over all cubic number ﬁelds as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSince Najman’s elliptic curve was discovered in [N], it was formally conjectured in [W] that\nthe only possible torsion groups for elliptic curves over cubic number ﬁelds are the ones in (1.1)\nand Z/21Z. Finally, Derickx, Etropolski, van Hoeij, Morrow, and Zureick-Brown [DE] proved\nthis conjecture, and hence the torsion group E(K)tors of an elliptic curve E over a cubic number\nﬁeld K must be isomorphic to one of the following 26 types:\nZ/N Z,\nZ/2Z\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOver quartic number ﬁelds K, it is proved in [JKP] that all the group structures occurring\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\ninﬁnitely often as torsion groups E(K)tors are exactly the following 38 types:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nZ/N1Z,\nZ/2Z\nZ/3Z\nZ/4Z\nZ/5Z\nZ/6Z\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\nN1 = 1\nZ/2N2Z, N2 = 1\nZ/3N3Z, N3 = 1\nZ/4N4Z, N4 = 1\nZ/5Z,\nZ/6Z,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhere K varies over all quartic number ﬁelds and E varies over all elliptic curves over K. In\nthe case of quartic number ﬁelds yet, a complete classiﬁcation of torsion subgroups has not been\nachieved. Unlike the cubic number ﬁelds, the sporic points on X1(N ) of degree 4 have not been\ndiscovered yet, so there is still a possibility that (1.3) will be a full classiﬁcation over quartic\nnumber ﬁelds, and it is very interesting to see how this result ends.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLastly, we will give a comment about our construction of elliptic curves with torsion subgroup\nZ/17Z over cyclic quartic number ﬁelds. Chou [C] proved that if E is an elliptic curve deﬁned\nover Q and K is a Galois quartic extension of Q, then E(K)tors is one of the following 27 types:\nN1 = 1\n−\nZ/2N2Z, N2 = 1\n−\nZ/3N3Z, N3 = 1, 2\nZ/4N4Z, N4 = 1, 2\nZ/5Z,\nZ/6Z,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nZ/N1Z,\nZ/2Z\nZ/3Z\nZ/4Z\nZ/5Z\nZ/6Z\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe above result implies that our elliptic curves with torsion Z/17Z over cyclic quartic number\nﬁelds have no Q-rational Weierstrass equations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n2.

Suppose that there is a Q-rational tetraelliptic map φ : X1(19)\nE for some elliptic\ncurve E. Then E is of conductor 19.

According to [C, Table 1], there exists only one isogeny class of conductor 19, and hence E\nand E′ are Q-isogenous. Since X1(19) is neither rational nor elliptic nor bielliptic, E′ is X1(19)-\noptimal but φ cannot factor through φ′ because of their degrees; hence we have a contradiction.\nThus X1(19) is not tetraelliptic over Q.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nBy the exact same proof, one can prove that X1(27) is not tetraelliptic over Q.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nLemma 3.8.

There is only one isogeny class of elliptic curves over Q with conductor dividing 36, and\nthis class has conductor 36. Actually, it is the isogeny class of X0(36). Now suppose that X1(36)\nis tetraelliptic over Q. By Proposition 3.6, there is an elliptic curve E in this isogeny class which\nis optimal for the uniformization from X1(36). The degree from X1(36) to E would have to\ndivide 4 (from the tetraelliptic map) and it would have to divide 6 (from the degree 6 map from\nX1(36) to the elliptic curve X0(36)). So X1(36) would be bielliptic, which is a contradiction to\n\nTheorem 3.1.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nLemma 3.9.

We will determine later whether each target curve of φN is the same as any of\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\nelliptic curves labeled in [Cr].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nNow consider the remaining cases, i.e. X1(26) and X1(30).

In general, the X0(N )-optimal curve E0 ∈ E\nand\nare diﬀerent. For example, E0 = X0(11) and E1 = X1(11)\nthe X1(N )-optimal curve E1 ∈ E\ndiﬀer by a 5-isogeny. Stein and Watkins [SW] have made a precise conjecture about when E0 and\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nE1 diﬀer by a 3-isogeny, based on numerical observation. Lee [Y] proved some partial results\nabout this conjecture and gave an example of an isogeny class of conductor 26 in which the\nX0(26)-optimal curve 26A1 and X1(26)-optimal curve 26A3 diﬀer by a 3-isogeny. According to\n26A1 is of degree 2 and the natural map\nTable 5 in [Cr], the modular parametrization X0(26)\n26A1 is of degree 12. By\nX1(26)\nProposition 3.6, this map factors through the modular parametrization X1(26)\n26A3, and\n26A3 and 26A1 diﬀer by 3-isogeny; hence X1(26)\n26A3 must be of degree 4. Thus X1(26) is\ntetraelliptic over Q.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.4**\nX0(26) is of degree 6; hence their composition X1(26)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.4**\nNow we ﬁnd out what the tetraelliptic map φ26 : X1(26)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n26A3 is. Bars [B] proved that\nX0(26) is a bielliptic curve, and W2 and W13 are all of its bielliptic involutions. According to\nLMFDB [LM], the corresponding cusp form f of weight 2 of 26A1 has\n1 as its second Fourier\ncoeﬃcient, and so the eigenvalue of f by W2 is +1; hence the quotient space X0(26)/W2 is equal\nto 26A1. For your information X0(26)/W13 is equal to 26B1. Then 26A1 should be X1(26)/G\nwhere G is the group of order 12 generated by Gal(X1(26)/X0(26)) =\nand W2. Since W2\nis cyclic. Now φ26 is a Galois\nas an automorphism of X1(26) is of order 12, the group G =\nW 3\nmap with a subgroup of G of order 4 as the Galois group. Since G has only one subgroup\n2 i\nh\nof order 4, the tetraelliptic map φ26 should be a cyclic map with Galois group\nNext we consider the case of X1(30). Assume there is a Q-rational tetraelliptic map φ :\nX1(30)\nE for some elliptic curve E. Then E has conductor 15 or 30. If E is of conductor\n30, then E is X1(30)-optimal by Theorem 3.1. The X0(30)-optimal curve in the isogeny class\nof E is 30A1. By [B], X0(30) has exactly 3 bielliptic involutions, namely W5, W6 and W30. By\nthe same method as in X1(26), one can check that X1(30)/W5 is equal to 30A1. Let F be\nthe compositum of the function ﬁelds of X0(30) and E, which is contained in the function ﬁeld\nof X1(30). But since X1(30) is cyclic of degree 4 over X0(30), there is only one intermediate\n. This means that the\n\nﬁeld. So F must be the function ﬁeld of X∆(30) where ∆ =\n}\nmap φ factors through X∆(30). So φ must be given by a subgroup of order 4 of the order 8\ngroup generated by Gal(X1(30)/X0(30)) =\nand W5. Since G is a dihedral group, it has 3\n[7]\ni\nh\nsubgroups of order 4. By using the method that we will explain later, we compute the quotient\nspace of X1(30) by each subgroup of order 4 but there was no case in which the quotient space\nis an ellptic curve over Q, which is a contradiction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThus E should be of conductor 15. However, it is tricky to deal with this case, and there are\nnot many known results. So we tried to calculate the quotient spaces by subgroups of order 4 of\nAut(X1(30)), and eventually got the desired result. Consider the subgroup of order 8 generated\nbe a Klein 4-subgroup. Then\nby [7] and W6, which is a dihedral group, and let H =\n15A8 is a Q-rational\nthe quotient space X1(30)/H is equal to 15A8, and so φ30 : X1(30)\ntetraelliptic map, and X1(30) is tetraelliptic over Q.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nSummarizing all of the above results, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.9**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n4.2.

         " TETRAELLIPTIC MODULAR CURVES X1(N )   Let X be a smooth, projective curve over a number ﬁeld K of genus g(X)   2. Suppose that E of degree d for some elliptic curve E. Then X is said to be bielliptic,   there is a map φ : X trielliptic, and tetraelliptic if d = 2, 3, and 4, respectively.   For a positive integer N , the modular curve X1(N ) (with cusps removed) parametrizes iso- morphism classes of pairs (E, P ), where E is an elliptic curve and P a torsion point of order N on E.   The ﬁrst author and Kim [JK] determined all bielliptic curves X1(N ). Recently, the author [J] determined all trielliptic curves X1(N ) over Q, i.e. they admit Q-rational trielliptic maps from X1(N ) to elliptic curves E over Q of degree 3. Also he construct explicit Q-rational trielliptic maps from trielliptic X1(N ) over Q to elliptic curves. Interestingly, he rediscovered the Najman’s elliptic curve labelled 162B1 over Q(ζ9)+ which is an elliptic curve over a cubic number ﬁeld with torsion Z/21Z in constructing a trielliptic map from X1(21) to an elliptic curve. Indeed, the elliptic curve 162B1 corresponds to a sporadic point on X1(21) of degree 3. In general, a point on X1(N ) is called a point of degree n if it is deﬁned over a number ﬁeld of degree n over Q. In particular, we call a point of degree 4 a quartic point.   In this paper, we determine all tetraelliptic modular curves X1(N ) over Q, and ﬁnd some tetraelliptic maps φN from tetraelliptic X1(N ) to elliptic curves for those tetraelliptic X1(N ). Also we will construct φN explicitly as rational functions. Constructing explicit expressions of maps from an algebraic curve with a high genus to an elliptic curve seems to be very meaningful from a computational point of view. At least the author could not ﬁnd any literature showing these explicit expressions except for the author’s previous work [J]. Moreover, we could show that all φN we found are Galois and ﬁnd elliptic curves with torsion subgroup Z/17Z over cyclic quartic number ﬁelds by using the cyclic map φ17.   Our main theorem is as follows:   Theorem 1.1. X1(N ) is tetraelliptic over Q if and only if N = 17, 20, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32. More- over, they all have Q-rational Galois tetraelliptic maps, i.e. they admit Q-rational Galois maps of degree 4 from X1(N ) to elliptic curves. Especially, they are cyclic for N = 17, 20, 26, 30 and 32, and the others are not.   We would like to make a few additional comments on the torsion subgroups of elliptic curves. As is well known, Mazur [M] determined all possible group structures of the torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over Q. Kamienny [K], Kenku and Momose [KM] completed the same work as Mazur over quadratic number ﬁelds.   After these results, attention shifted toward number ﬁelds of higher degrees. Jeon, Kim and Schweizer [JKS1] found all the torsion groups that appear inﬁnitely often as one runs through all elliptic curves over all cubic number ﬁelds as follows:   Since Najman’s elliptic curve was discovered in [N], it was formally conjectured in [W] that the only possible torsion groups for elliptic curves over cubic number ﬁelds are the ones in (1.1) and Z/21Z. Finally, Derickx, Etropolski, van Hoeij, Morrow, and Zureick-Brown [DE] proved this conjecture, and hence the torsion group E(K)tors of an elliptic curve E over a cubic number ﬁeld K must be isomorphic to one of the following 26 types: Z/N Z, Z/2Z   Over quartic number ﬁelds K, it is proved in [JKP] that all the group structures occurring   inﬁnitely often as torsion groups E(K)tors are exactly the following 38 types:   N1 = 1 Z/2N2Z, N2 = 1 Z/3N3Z, N3 = 1 Z/4N4Z, N4 = 1 Z/5Z, Z/6Z,   where K varies over all quartic number ﬁelds and E varies over all elliptic curves over K. In the case of quartic number ﬁelds yet, a complete classiﬁcation of torsion subgroups has not been achieved. Unlike the cubic number ﬁelds, the sporic points on X1(N ) of degree 4 have not been discovered yet, so there is still a possibility that (1.3) will be a full classiﬁcation over quartic number ﬁelds, and it is very interesting to see how this result ends.   Lastly, we will give a comment about our construction of elliptic curves with torsion subgroup Z/17Z over cyclic quartic number ﬁelds. Chou [C] proved that if E is an elliptic curve deﬁned over Q and K is a Galois quartic extension of Q, then E(K)tors is one of the following 27 types: N1 = 1 − Z/2N2Z, N2 = 1 − Z/3N3Z, N3 = 1, 2 Z/4N4Z, N4 = 1, 2 Z/5Z, Z/6Z,   The above result implies that our elliptic curves with torsion Z/17Z over cyclic quartic number ﬁelds have no Q-rational Weierstrass equations.   Let Γ(1) = SL2(Z) be the full modular group. For any positive integer N , we have subgroups a b 0 1 ), Γ(N ), Γ1(N ) and Γ0(N ) of Γ(1) deﬁned by matrices c d 0 1 ) and ( ∗ ∗ ( 1 ∗ 0 ∗ ), respectively. We let X(N ), X1(N ) and X0(N ) be the modular curves deﬁned over Q associated with Γ(N ), Γ1(N ) and Γ0(N ), respectively. There are some more modular with curves X∆(N ) associated with the subgroups Γ∆(N ) of Γ0(N ) deﬁned by matrices a   ∆, where ∆ is a subgroup of (Z/N Z)∗ that contains   that are congruent modulo N to ( 1 0   ∈ Now we introduce a special form of an elliptic curve that is used frequently to describe a pair (E, P ) which corresponds to a non-cuspidal point of X1(N ) (cf. [H]). The Tate normal form of an elliptic curve with a point P = (0, 0) is   , this is X1(N ).  }   − = 0. On the curve E(b, c), we can use the chord-tangent   and this is nonsingular if and only if b method to derive the following:   r + 1)  ; c = s(r 1)2(rs (s   The condition N P = O in E(b, c) gives a deﬁning equation for X1(N ). For example, 11P = O   implies 5P =   where XnP denotes the X-coordinate of the n-multiple nP of P . (2.1) implies that   Without loss of generality, the cases s = 0, 1 may be excluded. Then, (2.2) becomes   which is one of the equations for X1(11), called the raw form of X1(11). By the coordinate changes r = 1 + xy and s = 1   x, we have that   − f11(x, y) := y2 + (x2 + 1)y + x = 0.   1 + √2, then This solves the moduli problem of X1(11). If we pick x0 = (x0, y0) is a K-rational point on X1(11) satisfying f11(x0, y0) = 0, where K = Q(√2) is a   1, and set y0 =   quadratic number ﬁeld. If we apply the formulas in [Su, Table 7] and (2.1) with x = x0 and y = y0, we obtain   Then, the elliptic curve E(b0, c0) over K contains the point (0, 0) of order 11, and in fact its torsion subgroup is Z/11Z.   From [Su], we obtain the deﬁning equations of X1(N ) in [Su, Table 6] and birational maps ϕ 30, where FN (r, s) = 0   for X1(N ) from fN (x, y) = 0 to FN (r, s) = 0 in [Su, Table 7] for N denotes the raw form of X1(N ).   Now we explain another method to solve the moduli problem of X1(N ) introduced by Baaziz P1(Q). Then, Γ1(N ) acts on H∗ under [B]. Let H be the complex upper half plane and H∗ = H H∗. linear fractional transformations, and X1(N )(C) can be viewed as a Riemann surface Γ1(N ) \\ H have a one-to-one correspondence with the equivalence classes of The points of Γ1(N ) \\ elliptic curves E, together with a speciﬁed point P of exact order N . Let Lτ = [τ, 1] be the lattice in C with basis τ and 1. Then, [τ ] H corresponds to the pair . Γ1(N ) \\ H is a moduli space for the moduli problem of determining equivalence classes of Thus, Γ1(N )  \\ pairs (E, P ), where E is an elliptic curve deﬁned over C, and P E is a point of exact order E′ that takes N . Two pairs (E, P ) and (E′, P ′) are equivalent if there is an isomorphism E P to P ′.   Note that   where g2(τ ) = 60G4(τ ), g3(τ ) = 140G6(τ ) for the Eisenstein series G2k(τ ) of weight 2k, ℘(z, τ ) := ℘(z, Lτ ) is the Weierstrass elliptic function, and b(τ ), c(τ ) are the coeﬃcients of N + Lτ the Tate normal form contained in   . Also, if we let   then we have the following relations:   g2(τ ) =12a(τ )2 + 2b(τ )(1 8a(τ )3 g3(τ ) =   which gives the last equality of (2.3) (See [B] for more details.).   Note that each equivalence class of pairs (E, P ) contains a unique Tate normal form [B, H. From [B], Proposition 1.3], and hence b(τ ) and c(τ ) induce well-deﬁned functions on Γ1(N ) \\   it follows that   N , τ ) N , τ ) are modular functions on Γ1(N ) and generate the function ﬁeld of X1(N ), where ℘′ is the derivative with respect to z. Thus, for each non-cuspidal point τ X1(N ), an elliptic curve E(b(τ ), c(τ )) with N -torsion point (0, 0) corresponds.   Finally, we decribe some automorphisms of X∆(N ). Note that X∆(N )   X0(N ) is a Galois covering with Galois group Γ0(N )/Γ∆(N ) which is isomorphic to (Z/N Z)∗/∆. For an integer a prime to N, let [a] denote the automorphism of X∆(N ) represented by γ Γ0(N ) such that γ   ( a ∗ 0 ∗ ) mod N. Sometimes we regard [a] as a matrix.   ≡ N with (d, N/d) = 1, consider the matrices of the form For each divisor d |   dx N z dw   Z and determinant d. Then these matrices deﬁne a unique involution of X0(N ), x, y, z, w which is called the Atkin-Lehner involution and denoted by Wd. In particular, if d = N, then WN is called the Fricke involution. We also denote by Wd a matrix of the above form.   If we ﬁx a matrix Wd then Wd may not belong to the normalizer N (Γ∆(N )) of Γ∆(N ) in PSL2(R) and might therefore not deﬁne an automorphism of X∆(N ). However Wd is always contained in N (Γ1(N )); hence it deﬁnes an automorphism of X1(N ). But it may not deﬁne an   involution of X1(N ). For example, W2 = deﬁnes an automorphism of X1(26) of order 26 14 8. Moreover, if a is running through (Z/N Z)∗/∆, then [a]Wd gives the diﬀerent automorphisms of X∆(N ) that induce the same Atkin-Lehner involution Wd on X0(N ).   For square-free N , Momose claimed that the automorphism group Aut(X∆(N )) is equal to N (Γ∆(N ))/Γ∆(N ) in his unpublished work [Mo]. But the author, Kim and Schweizer [JKS2] . There-  found a counterexample for the case X∆(37) where ∆ = } fore, it can be concluded that the automorphism group of X1(N ) has not yet been completely determined even for square-free N .   3. Non-tetraelliptic curves   For determining non-tetraelliptic curves X1(N ), we ﬁrst give lists of rational, elliptic, bielliptic   or trielliptic curves X1(N ) as follows:   Theorem 3.1. ([JK, J]) The following holds: (1) X1(N ) is rational if and only if N = 1 (2) X1(N ) is elliptic if and only if N = 11, 14, 15. (3) X1(N ) is bielliptic if and only if N = 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24 (4) X1(N ) is trielliptic over Q if and only if N = 19, 21, 22, 27, 30   Let X be a smooth, projective curve over a ﬁeld K. The K-gonality GonK (X) of X is the P1.   minimal degree of a ﬁnite K-rational map X   Proposition 3.2. ([A], [Ki]) Let Γ modular curve X(Γ) is at least λ1   SL2(Z) be a congruence subgroup. The C-gonality of the   Suppose X is tetraelliptic, and there exists a Q-rational tetraelliptic map X   elliptic curve E. Since there exists a Q-rational map E GonC(X)   GonQ(X), applying Proposition 3.2, we have the following:   → P1 of degree 2, GonQ(X)   E for some 8. Since   Lemma 3.3. X1(N ) is not tetraelliptic over Q for N = 41, 43, 45, 47, and N   Proof. Note that [SL2(Z) : Γ] = ϕ(N )ψ(N )   , where ψ(N ) = N   3.2, GonC(X1(N ))   , and the result follows from the inequality   . By Proposition   On the other hand, Derickx and van Hoeij [DH, Table 1] computed GonQ(X1(N )) for N   and gave upper bounds for N   250. The following result comes from the table.   Lemma 3.4. X1(N ) is not tetraelliptic over Q for N = 29, 31, 33   The fact that GonQ(X1(N )) > 8 is found in [DH, Table 1] for N in Lemma 3.4 except for   N = 42, 44, 46, 48, and the fact that GonQ(X1(42)) > 8 is on p. 67 in [DH].   Suppose there exists a Q-rational tetraelliptic map X1(N )   E for some elliptic curve E. Then the conductor of E divides N . By using this fact together with [C, Table1], we have the following:   Lemma 3.5. X1(N ) is not tetraelliptic over Q for N = 13, 16, 18, 22, 23, 25.   We recall a basic fact about modular parametrization.   Proposition 3.6. [S, (1.4) Proposition] Let conductor N . Then there exists an elliptic curve E1 and a modular parametrization   be an isogeny class (over Q) of elliptic curves of   such that if π : X1(N ) isogeny φ : E1 →   E is a parametrization of an elliptic curve E   E which makes the following diagram commutative:   , then there is an   The elliptic curve E1 of Proposition 3.6 is called the X1(N )-optimal curve. On the other hand, there exists an elliptic curve E0 having the same property described in Proposition 3.6 for the modular parametrizaions of X0(N ), and it is called the X0(N )-optimal curve.   Lemma 3.7. X1(19) and X1(27) are not tetraelliptic over Q.   Proof. Suppose that there is a Q-rational tetraelliptic map φ : X1(19) E for some elliptic curve E. Then E is of conductor 19. By Theorem 3.1, X1(19) is trielliptic over Q, and so there E′ of degree 3 for some elliptic curve E′ of conductor exists a Q-rational map φ′ : X1(19)   19. According to [C, Table 1], there exists only one isogeny class of conductor 19, and hence E and E′ are Q-isogenous. Since X1(19) is neither rational nor elliptic nor bielliptic, E′ is X1(19)- optimal but φ cannot factor through φ′ because of their degrees; hence we have a contradiction. Thus X1(19) is not tetraelliptic over Q.   By the exact same proof, one can prove that X1(27) is not tetraelliptic over Q.   Lemma 3.8. X1(36) is not tetraelliptic over Q.   Proof. There is only one isogeny class of elliptic curves over Q with conductor dividing 36, and this class has conductor 36. Actually, it is the isogeny class of X0(36). Now suppose that X1(36) is tetraelliptic over Q. By Proposition 3.6, there is an elliptic curve E in this isogeny class which is optimal for the uniformization from X1(36). The degree from X1(36) to E would have to divide 4 (from the tetraelliptic map) and it would have to divide 6 (from the degree 6 map from X1(36) to the elliptic curve X0(36)). So X1(36) would be bielliptic, which is a contradiction to  Theorem 3.1.   Lemma 3.9. X1(21) is not tetraelliptic over Q.   Proof. By following the exact same proof of Lemma 3.8, one can calculate that if X1(21) is tetraelliptic over Q then it must be bielliptic over Q. However X1(21) does not allow a Q-  rational map to an elliptic curve of degree 2 by [JK, Lemma 3.5].   Remark 3.10. X1(21) is tetraelliptic but not over Q. Indeed, there exist a map X1(21) → X∆(21) of degree 2, where ∆ = . By [JKS2, Table1], we know that X∆(21) is a  } biellipitic curve with a bielliptic involution W21; hence X1(21) is a tetraelliptic curve. We note that W21 is not deﬁned over Q.   4. Tetraelliptic curves over Q   For the reader’s convenience, we restate Theorem 1.1 as follows: X1(N ) is tetraelliptic over Q if and only if N = 17, 20, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32. Moreover they admit Q-rational Galois maps, say φN , from X1(N ) to elliptic curves of degree 4. Especially for N = 17, 20, 26, 30 and 32, X1(N ) is cyclic tetraelliptic, and the others are not.   In this section, for N listed above, we show X1(N ) are tetraelliptic over Q, and construct EN for some elliptic curves EN . Moreover, we ﬁnd elliptic   tetraelliptic maps φN : X1(N ) curves with torsion subgroup Z/17Z over cyclic quartic number number ﬁelds by using φ17.   4.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1. For N = 17, 20, 24, 28, 32, there are natural tetraelliptic maps from X1(N ) to elliptic curves, namely φ17 : X1(17) X0(20), → X∆2(32) where ∆1 = X0(24), φ28 : X1(28) φ24 : X1(24) [7] and G32 = and ∆2 = 4, i h are Klein 4-groups, where   → X1(14), and φ32 : X1(32) . Then G17 =  ± } and G28 = [5], [7] i h   {± ± are cyclic groups of order 4, and G24 =   . We will determine later whether each target curve of φN is the same as any of   elliptic curves labeled in [Cr].   Now consider the remaining cases, i.e. X1(26) and X1(30). Let   denote an isogeny class of elliptic curves deﬁned over Q of conductor N . In general, the X0(N )-optimal curve E0 ∈ E and are diﬀerent. For example, E0 = X0(11) and E1 = X1(11) the X1(N )-optimal curve E1 ∈ E diﬀer by a 5-isogeny. Stein and Watkins [SW] have made a precise conjecture about when E0 and   E1 diﬀer by a 3-isogeny, based on numerical observation. Lee [Y] proved some partial results about this conjecture and gave an example of an isogeny class of conductor 26 in which the X0(26)-optimal curve 26A1 and X1(26)-optimal curve 26A3 diﬀer by a 3-isogeny. According to 26A1 is of degree 2 and the natural map Table 5 in [Cr], the modular parametrization X0(26) 26A1 is of degree 12. By X1(26) Proposition 3.6, this map factors through the modular parametrization X1(26) 26A3, and 26A3 and 26A1 diﬀer by 3-isogeny; hence X1(26) 26A3 must be of degree 4. Thus X1(26) is tetraelliptic over Q.   X0(26) is of degree 6; hence their composition X1(26)   Now we ﬁnd out what the tetraelliptic map φ26 : X1(26)   26A3 is. Bars [B] proved that X0(26) is a bielliptic curve, and W2 and W13 are all of its bielliptic involutions. According to LMFDB [LM], the corresponding cusp form f of weight 2 of 26A1 has 1 as its second Fourier coeﬃcient, and so the eigenvalue of f by W2 is +1; hence the quotient space X0(26)/W2 is equal to 26A1. For your information X0(26)/W13 is equal to 26B1. Then 26A1 should be X1(26)/G where G is the group of order 12 generated by Gal(X1(26)/X0(26)) = and W2. Since W2 is cyclic. Now φ26 is a Galois as an automorphism of X1(26) is of order 12, the group G = W 3 map with a subgroup of G of order 4 as the Galois group. Since G has only one subgroup 2 i h of order 4, the tetraelliptic map φ26 should be a cyclic map with Galois group Next we consider the case of X1(30). Assume there is a Q-rational tetraelliptic map φ : X1(30) E for some elliptic curve E. Then E has conductor 15 or 30. If E is of conductor 30, then E is X1(30)-optimal by Theorem 3.1. The X0(30)-optimal curve in the isogeny class of E is 30A1. By [B], X0(30) has exactly 3 bielliptic involutions, namely W5, W6 and W30. By the same method as in X1(26), one can check that X1(30)/W5 is equal to 30A1. Let F be the compositum of the function ﬁelds of X0(30) and E, which is contained in the function ﬁeld of X1(30). But since X1(30) is cyclic of degree 4 over X0(30), there is only one intermediate . This means that the  ﬁeld. So F must be the function ﬁeld of X∆(30) where ∆ = } map φ factors through X∆(30). So φ must be given by a subgroup of order 4 of the order 8 group generated by Gal(X1(30)/X0(30)) = and W5. Since G is a dihedral group, it has 3 [7] i h subgroups of order 4. By using the method that we will explain later, we compute the quotient space of X1(30) by each subgroup of order 4 but there was no case in which the quotient space is an ellptic curve over Q, which is a contradiction.   Thus E should be of conductor 15. However, it is tricky to deal with this case, and there are not many known results. So we tried to calculate the quotient spaces by subgroups of order 4 of Aut(X1(30)), and eventually got the desired result. Consider the subgroup of order 8 generated be a Klein 4-subgroup. Then by [7] and W6, which is a dihedral group, and let H = 15A8 is a Q-rational the quotient space X1(30)/H is equal to 15A8, and so φ30 : X1(30) tetraelliptic map, and X1(30) is tetraelliptic over Q.   Summarizing all of the above results, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.1.   4.2. Construction of tetraelliptic maps. From now on, we construct tetraelliptic maps φN : X1(N ) EN explicitly, i.e. we ﬁnd the rational expressions of φN in terms of x and y satisfying deﬁning equations fN (x, y) = 0 of X1(N ) as introduced in Section 2.   First consider the case of X1(17). Then the map X1(17)   a tetraelliptic map as explained above.   If we take [2] = ( 2 1   is [2] X∆1(17) = X1(17)/ i h 17 9 ), then [2] acts on X1(17) as   17τ +9 . In this case, we have the following:   Thus, from (2.4), we obtain the following:   Similarly, we have     From (2.1) and [Su, Table 7], we have that the generators x, y of the function ﬁeld of X1(17)   satisfying f17(x, y) = 0 can be expressed as the following functions of b, c:   c3 + b2 c)( 3b2c2 + 3bc3 + b3 bc2 + 2b2 − 3b2c2 + 3bc3 + b3   bc) 2b2c + bc2 , − − 3bc + c2) 2b2c + bc2 . − −   From the formulas in Proposition 3 of [L, p. 46], we can determine the q-expansions for ℘(z, τ ) and ℘′(z, τ ), where q = e2πiτ . Using these q-expansions and (2.4), (4.1), and (4.4), we arrive at   the following q-expansions:   2ø9 − − 2ø13 + ø12 2ø3 + ø2 ø12 − ø13   − + ø5 ø14 − 3ø15 4ø5 − ø11 2ø15 x([4]τ ) = y([4]τ ) =2ø15 + 3ø14 + 2ø13   − − 3ø2 4 + O(q), − ø10 ø6 ø7 ø11 + ø10 + 3ø9 + 3ø8 + ø7   x([8]τ ) =2ø15 + ø14 + 2ø13 + ø12 + 2ø11 + ø10 + 2ø9 + 2ø8   + ø7 + 2ø6 + ø5 + 2ø4 + ø3 + 2ø2 + 2 + O(q),   Now we let ¯x(τ ) = x(τ )+x([2]τ )+x([4]τ )+x([8]τ ) and ¯y(τ ) = y(τ )+y([2]τ )+y([4]τ )+y([8]τ ), and then ¯x, ¯y generate the function ﬁeld of X∆1(17). Using them we can obtain a deﬁning equation of X∆1(17) by the following the algorithm.   (1) Set a polynomial f (x, y) =   anxiyj for a positive integer d and   unknown an.   (2) Input the q-expansions of ¯x(τ ) and ¯y(τ ) in f (x, y). (3) For the equation g(¯x, ¯y) = 0, compare the coeﬃcients of qm for 0   set a system of linear equations.   (4) Solve the system of (3), and obtain a deﬁning equation.   By using Algorithm 4.1, we obtain a deﬁning equation of X∆1(17) as follows:   By using the computer algebra system Maple, we can convert g(x, y) into a Weierstrass   equation, and we have the following:   E17 : v2 + uv + v = u3   Thus E17 is equal to 17A2 whose torsion group is Z/4Z. Here an isomorphism between X∆1(17) and E17 is given by   u(x, y) =(x5 + x4y + 7x4 + 5x3y + 26x3 + 15x2y + xy2 + 63x2 + 27xy + y2   + 90x + 17y + 50)/(x4 + 4x3 + 12x2 + 18x + 10)   v(x, y) =(x5y + 3x5 + 7x4y + 16x4 + 25x3y + x2y2 + 56x3 + 58x2y + 3xy2   + 121x2 + 73xy + 3y2 + 136x + 41y + 70)/(x4 + 4x3 + 12x2 + 18x + 10)   Remark 4.2. By the exact same method as above, we could ﬁnd the target elliptic curves EN for N = 20, 24, 28, 32 are 20A1,24A1,14A4,32A2, respectively.   We compute the q-expansions of two generators u(τ ) and v(τ ) of the function ﬁeld of E17 by   using (4.5) and the q-expansions of ¯x(τ ) and ¯y(τ ) as follows: 2ø12 3ø12   − Now we obtain the explicit expression of φ17 : X1(17)   2ø3 + 2 + O(q), 3ø3 + 5 + O(q).   − E17 by the following algorithm.   (1) Set two polynomials g(x, y) =   anxiyj and h(x, y) =   bnxiyj   for a positive integer d and unknown an and bn.   (2) Input the q-expansions of x(τ ) and y(τ ) in g(x, y) and h(x, y). (3) For each of two equations g(x(τ ), y(τ )) = u(τ )h(x(τ ), y(τ )) and g(x(τ ), y(τ )) = v(τ )h(x(τ ), y(τ )),   compare the coeﬃcients of qm for 0 equations.   (d + 1)(d + 2), and set two system of linear   (4) Solve the systems of (3), we obtain a rational map   , where g1(x, y) and h1(x, y) (resp. g2(x, y) and h2(x, y)) are obtain by solving the system of linear equations from g(x(τ ), y(τ )) = u(τ )h(x(τ ), y(τ )) (resp. g(x(τ ), y(τ )) = v(τ )h(x(τ ), y(τ ))).   Finally, by using Algorithm 4.3, we obtain an explicit expression of the tetraelliptic map   E17, say φ17(x, y) = (p1(x, y), p2(x, y)), as follows:   Next we will construct the tetraelliptic map φ26 : X1(26) , then W2 acts on X1(26) as W2τ = 2τ +1   W 3 X1(26)/ 2 i h 26τ +14 . In this case, we have the following:   = 26A3. If we take   Thus, from (2.4), we obtain the following:    26 , 2τ By using this action and the exact same method as in the case of X1(17), we can ﬁnd an explicit expression of φ26 as in Table 1. We can treat the other cases by the exact same procedure. We list in Table 1 explicit expressions of φN for the list of N in Theorem 1.1.   Table 1: Explicit expressions of φN   N Explicit expressions of φN = (p1(x, y), p2(x, y))   p1(x, y) = p2(x, y) =   4.3. Construction of elliptic curves. In this subsection, we will construct the elliptic curves corresponding to the quartic points of X1(17) lying above the Q-rational torsion points of E17. E17 is cyclic of degree 4 and E17 has torsion subgroup Z/4Z. Let → 5/4, 1/8) which are two non-zero points of the four torsion points of −   P1 := (3, E17. For P1, by solving the system of equations   Note that φ17 : X1(17) 2) and P2 := (   we obtain the four points of X1(17) lying above P1 which are   p1(x, y) = 3, p2(x, y) =   7x2 + 10x + 8 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The quartic number ﬁelds where αi’s are four roots of 2x4 Q(αi) are cyclic over Q for all i. Similarly, we obtain the four points lying above P2 which are 2βi − 11x −   (4.8) where βi’s are four roots of 8x4 + 14x3 2 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The quartic number ﬁelds Q(βi) are cyclic over Q for all i either. We note that ( 1, 0) is the point of X1(17) lying above the third non-zero point of E17, and it is a cusp of X1(17); hence we cannot obtain the corresponding elliptic curve.   From (2.1) and Table 7 of [Su], the elliptic curves corresponding to (4.7) are given by   and the elliptic curves corresponding to (4.7) are given by (4.10)   Then E1i(resp. E2i) are elliptic curves over cyclic quartic extensions Q(αi)(resp. Q(βi)) over Q with torsion subgroup Z/17Z for all i.   We have tried the same method in all other cases, but unfortunately we have not achieved the same results as 17. In all other cases, the points on X1(N ) lying above the torsion points are cusps, so the corresponding elliptic curves could not be obtained.   We are grateful to Andreas Schweizer for discussing various results in this paper.",

The rapid digital transformation caused by the\npandemic necessitated digital competence development needs in both nursing education and practice\nwith changes that are “likely to be sustained”, while the need for nurses who have “digital expertise\nand  the  ability  to  lead  change  is  increasing  exponentially”  (NHS  England,  n.d.).  Within  the  next  two\ndecades,  most  jobs  in  the  UK  National  Health  System  (NHS)  will  have  a  digital  component,  as  staff\nnavigate  a  data-rich  healthcare  environment  and  develop  digital  competence  skills  for  fast  growing\ntechnologically  enhanced  work  settings  (Topol  Review,  2019)  dealing  with  increased  digital  data\n(Capgemini, 2022) and a “digital future” that “is already transforming the way nursing care is delivered”\n(RCN, 2024).  A priority area for the health and care sector is, therefore, “when, why and, crucially, how\nto use digital”, with essential digital workforce development (Scottish Government, 2021).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe Code of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (2023) identifies digital skills as integral for all registered\nnurses, however, a lack of formal digital competencies training structure in nursing education results in\nfragmented  digital  knowledge  and  experiences  (De  Leeuw  et  al.,  2022).  Frustration  with  new  and\nongoing integration of technology and lack of confidence/skills with healthcare technology is associated\nwith emotional exhaustion among nurses in practice (Tawfik et al. 2021). Among nursing students, who\nprepare for increasingly digitalised future careers, the existence of digital divides also creates significant\nchallenges (Saeed and Masters, 2021). Despite the widespread presence of digital technology in nursing\nstudents' lives, students still experience gaps even in baseline digital literacy (NMC, 2023). For example,\ntargeted digital literacy education interventions around technology-enhanced learning and simulation\nare needed as part of foundational nursing studies to improve nursing students' baseline digital literacy\nbefore commencing clinical placement (Lokmic-Tomkins et al., 2022).\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nAcademic libraries have established expertise in developing subject support for nursing and offering\ntraining for students on the basis of health information literacy (Purnell, Royal and Warton, 2020), such\nas how to identify database search techniques across different health related sources, using effective\nsearch approaches (e.g., Boolean operators and advanced searching), and how to evaluate and ethically\nuse information following referencing standards and academic integrity. However, health information\nliteracy is also a crucial professional skill for the delivery of evidence-based health information services\n(e.g.,  systematic  literature  reviews).  Academic  libraries  have  been  supporting  nursing  students  to\ndevelop  different  digital  skills  to  navigate  broader  technological  developments,  from  using  internet\nsearch engines and Web 2.0 to sourcing and analysing big data and to the use of digital health services\nfor their potential to advance clinical practice and the delivery of patient care as well as the current\nfocus  on  the  ethical  use  of  generative  artificial  intelligence  for  information  discovery  (e.g.,  using  AI\nSearch Tools). Davenport and Kalakota (2019) discuss the opportunities created by Natural language\nprocessing (NLP) in the health professional environment for “understanding and classification of clinical\ndocumentation and published research” for the purpose, for example, of analyzing unstructured clinical\nnotes,  reports  and  patient  interactions.  Academic  libraries  empower  students  to  engage  with\ntechnology,  explore  digital  content,  and  develop  their  digital  literacy  skills.  Increasingly,  academic\nlibraries  have  also  started  to  develop  support  and  guidance  in  the  form  of  LibGuides  that  focus  on\nnavigating the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. For example, the University of Cambridge libraries\noffer guidance on the use of AI answering questions such as which AI tools to use, how to get the best\nresults from AI and how to reference AI tools (University of Cambridge 2023). Subject specific Libguides\nin health developed by academic libraries, aim to increase awareness of how it is currently transforming\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nTo realise the true potential of digitally enabled health and social care services, it becomes necessary\nto develop a unified and concentrated effort to transform the education and skills provision for those\nworking in delivering health and social care (Morrison et al., 2022). This necessitates a deeper and on-\ngoing exploration of nursing students’ development needs and readiness to apply digital skills within a\nconstantly evolving nursing education and professional environment.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nhealthcare with new applications and advancements which enhance health related clinical practice and\nas well as evidence-based research (e.g., systematic reviews) (Khalil, Ameen, & Zarnegar, 2022).  For\nexample, King’s College Libraries and Collections (2024) offers access to AI tools for evidence synthesis\nproviding resources for health students on AI tools and how to use them for learning, research and\nhealthcare related practice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nLiterature Review\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nHowever,  developing  library  support  and  implementing  digital  skills  programmes  necessitates\nunderstanding of students’ existing digital skills gaps. Not all students arrive to education with the same\ndigital skills and competencies and therefore, ongoing critical exploration of existing digital divides and\nneeds is crucial for offering meaningful digital literacy programmes and support.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nRecent research exploring the development of nursing students’ digital skills or competencies has found\nvariability in focus and directions (Matthews 2021; Nes, 2021) and a lack of a holistic approach to digital\nliteracy skills development in academia. For example, in a scoping review of technological literacy in\nnursing  education,  Nes  identified  several  different  foci,  including  computer  literacy,  health/nursing\ninformatics  and  technology  acceptance,  while  a  direction  towards  higher  level  digital  skills,  such  as\nproblem-solving and critical thinking was omitted. Similarly, Harerimana et al. (2022) highlighted a need\nto incorporate digital literacy education beyond basic computer, internet and digital device use–related\nskills, while Brown et al. (2020) noticed the lack of advanced/more specialised digital skills for transferal\nto the clinical/care working environment. Other research has emphasised gaps in students’ knowledge\non eHealth literacy (Holt et al., 2020; Jeon and Kim, 2022; Mather et al., 2022; Blakemore et al., 2020)\nand students’ attitudes to technology (Lekalakala-Mokgele et al., 2023). However, overall, studies are\ninconclusive  as  the  methodologies  and  measurements  followed  are  either  dissimilar  or  focused  on\ndifferent digital skills required (Erdat et al., 2023).\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nBove  and  Sauer  (2023)  explored  levels  of  knowledge  and  skills  that  nursing  academic  staff  should\npossess to teach their students, and the need for both educators and nursing practitioners to embrace\nAI-enabled innovations to “lead the digital future” (Castonguay et al., 2023). The need for continuous\neducation  has  been  identified  for  years  as  a  priority  in  the  European  agenda  to  digitize  healthcare\n(European Health Parliament, 2016, p.8) with a call for mandatory, continuous and tailored training\nprograms on digital skills. At UK level, however, although “Digital health is a high priority in government,\nNHS  organisations  and  Royal  Colleges”  there  is  a  gap  between  expectations  around  digital  skills\ndevelopment and the actual implementation of education within school curricula and training for staff\nvia professional development activities. Post pandemic, the need for digital health education is even\ngreater with remote health consultations and digital health solutions (Holland Brown and Bewick, 2022,\np.214).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nDespite the urgent call for the ongoing development of digital skills, “digital divides” amongst the health\nand  social  care  workforce  (including  nurses)  still  exist.  For  example,  in  relation  to  the  geographical\ninterest of this study, NHS Education for Scotland indicates a digital literacy skills gap in the healthcare\nsector, with key findings from a large-scale digital skills user research study (Digital Health and Care,\n2022), which indicates both a lack of digital skills training and agreed terminology which can result in\ndigital  exclusion,  manifested  though  lack  of  engagement  or  confidence,  competence  and  access\n(Capgemini, 2022).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nTo support nursing students building digital competencies as future professionals operating within a\ncomplex digitally enabled health arena, a holistic understanding of digital skills, gaps and barriers is\nrequired, focusing on moving from baseline to more advanced digital literacy skills development and to\nan  effective  transition  towards  technologically  advanced  health  working  environments  (Lokmic-\nTomkins et al. 2022). This study therefore aims to offer a better understanding of nursing students’\ndifferent levels of digital competencies and explore how digital exclusion experiences may play a role\nin the way in which they develop them.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nAims and Objectives\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThis research presents an approach that aims to explore students’ diverse digital competencies that are\nkey  for  learning  and  for  supporting  a  digital  evolving  professional  environment,  as  well  as  examine\nstudents’  diverse  experiences  of  digital  divides.

Previous  research  with  students  has  found  that  they  have  positive\nattitudes  and  feel  competent  towards  information  and  communication  technology  use  in  clinical\npractice to support care values and work efficiency (Warshawski et al., 2019). However, not only the\ndigital  environment  is  constantly  evolving,  but  also  more  recent  studies  have  extended  a  focus  on\ntechnological skills to cover additional areas of digital capability that have a behavioural and “soft skills”\nfocus, encompassing digital “learning and development”, “identity and wellbeing”, “problem solving\nand innovation”, “information, data and media literacies” and “digital communication, collaboration\nand  participation”.  These  emphasise  the  importance  of  improving  students’  digital  capabilities  to\nenhance  their  self-efficacy,  confidence  and  self-actualization  in  their  academic  studies  (Ibrahim  and\nAldawsari, 2023).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThis study followed a cross-sectional survey of nursing students by means of an online questionnaire\nadministered  to  all  students  studying  in  undergraduate  (Year  1,  2  and  3)  and  postgraduate  nursing\ncourses within a single Scottish HE institution. The questionnaire instrument collected quantitative and\nqualitative data in a concurrent mixed methodological survey design, with a) closed ended questions\nexploring students’ demographics (age, learning disabilities (neurodiversity), urban/rural geographical\nlocation of growing up and study year), students’ self-perceived digital competencies, and digital divide\nbarriers  and  b)  open-ended  questions  which  aimed  to  examine,  in  more  detail,  challenges  and\nstrategies of students with learning disabilities/neurodiversity.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nDigital competencies\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nIn this study, we utilised an empirically tested digital competencies self-assessment survey tool that\nwas adapted based on the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (Carretero et al., 2017)\nand The Digital Capabilities framework (JISC, 2022) to holistically explore digital competencies from a\nnursing-based  perspective.  The  survey  explored  digital  competencies  within  everyday  life,  nursing\nrelated education and practice, addressing nursing related digital competencies with examples from\nthe context of nursing: for example, the use of health related information sources (such as CINAHL,\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nMedline, Cochrane Library), the application of digital creation skills in nursing (such as those for using\nsimulation/virtual reality tools and discipline specific apps, e.g.,  BNF British National Formulary) and\nfor the use of health digital research skills (such as those for using health specific critical appraisal tools,\ne.g., Critical Appraisals Skills Programme (CASP) and evidence-based research tools). The structure and\nthe  dimensions  of  the  questionnaire  survey  are  available  in  Supplementary_material_appendix_A,\nTable A1. The survey measurement was based on a five-point Likert type scale of digital competencies\nwhich  represented  different  levels  of  knowledge  and  self-sufficiency  based  on  performing  specific\ndigital tasks (Supplementary_material_appendix_A, Table A2).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nDigital barriers/divides\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThird-level digital divides were explored via an overarching question that addressed students’ overall\ndigital abilities to fulfil academic outcomes (Supplementary_material_appendix_A, Table A1).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nWei,  Chan  and  Tan  (2011)  highlight  three  potential  levels  of  digital  divide  including  access  to\ninformation technology (first level divide), digital capability (second-level divide), and digital outcomes\n(third-level digital divide) which relate to learning and productivity. In relation to first level divides, data\nin the survey were collected on information technology access barriers experienced by students related\nto an urban/rural divide (up to the time of finishing school), such as lack of access to electricity, and\naccess to basic computer training, broadband, desktop computers/laptop, and smart mobile phones\nuse (Sparks, 2013, p.28; DiMaggio et al. 2010; Wei, Chan and Tan, 2011). Second-level divides were\nexplored by means of identifying self-assessed digital competencies gaps, described above, which were\nfurther elaborated based on contextual and behavioural barriers students experienced in developing\nthem,  such  as  lack  of  time,  up-to-date  training  in  specific  digital  skills  (Gilmour  et  al.,  2008)  and\nstudents’  interest,  urgency,  confidence  and  their  perceptions  of  difficulty  around  developing  these\nskills. These questions helped to explore more holistically intersecting digital divides variables that may\nplay a role in students’ digital competencies development.\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe impact of age demographics, may be difficult to delineate with different studies following diverse\nways of categorising age groupings (Dimock, 2019). This study focused on a binary categorisation, given\nthe focus of the research on digital skills and digital connectivity: students born before the year 2000\nand students born in that year or after (which characterises approximately the start of Generation Z\nlearners) (Shorey et al., 2021). The change of the millennium marked an important technological shift\nin everyday life digital access and interaction, with the widespread adoption and use of the Internet,\ndigital technologies and social media. People born after the change of the millennium had experiences\nof growing up in a more technologically saturated world and this may have shaped up for them different\nonline experiences. Prensky describes these individuals as ‘Digital Natives’, in other words the “native\nspeakers” of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet” and the first generation\nto grow up with these new technologies (2001a; 2001b).  In a literature review of 80 studies, Alruthaya,\nNguyen and Lokuge (2021) reported on different research where Gen Z students were found “to be\nable to access digital technologies more than other generations” (Sakdiyakorn et al., 2021), noting a\npreference  towards  visual  versus  textual  information  (Hernandez-de-Menendez  et  al.,  2020).  Other\nstudies focusing on nursing students have reported differences in both everyday life digital activities,\nsuch  as  using  daily  social  media  (Vizcaya-Moreno  and  Pérez-Cañaveras,  2020)  and  preferences  for\nspecific learning approaches, such as experiential learning, independent learning and use of multimedia\n(Hampton and Keys, 2017).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nAge demographics divides\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.5**\nLearning disabilities (neurodivergence) divides\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe  study  also  sought  to  explore  potential  first  and  second-level  digital  divides  within  the\nunderrepresented  15-20%  neurodivergent  student  population  (Doyle,  2020).  Despite  the  high\nincidence  of  neurodivergence  in  students  attending  universities  internationally  (which  is  growing),\nthere  appears  a  dearth  of  neurodivergent  pedagogical  literature  (Hamilton  and  Petty  2023).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nNeurodiversity “is an umbrella term that represents the neurological variability of the human brain”\nwhich includes many terms such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia,\ndyspraxia, epilepsy, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Lukava, et al., 2022 p.76) and can be formally\ndiagnosed or a self-reported protected characteristic (Equality Act, 2010). Although there are various\nstatistics, it is suggested that 15-20% of the population is reported as neurodivergent (Doyle, 2020).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.5**\nDivides related to rural/urban experiences of growing up\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nStudents were asked to first indicate if they had a neurodivergent condition (actual or suspected) in\none or more of the following areas: autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia and Attention\nDeficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD).  Following  that,  the  students  were  asked  to  explain  if  they\nencountered  any  problems,  difficulties  or  barriers  when  completing  digital  tasks/using  digital  tools\nrelated to their study.  Finally, students were asked to list any apps, programmes, or digital tools that\nhelped them as a neurodivergent person or any other elements that supported their life or learning\nthat  they  felt  might  also  be  useful  to  others  (e.g.,  for  accessibility,  time  management,  study\norganisation/prioritisation, visualisation).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe presence of a “urban/rural digital divide” is “widely acknowledged” in previous research (Philip et\nal.  2017,  p.386)  and  policy  (ITU,  2020)  as  a  determining  factor  for  digital  skills  development.  For\nexample, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2021) has described the term\n“digital divide” as “different levels of access and use of information and communication technologies\n(ICTs) and, most often, to the gaps in access and use of Internet-based digital services” which can “vary\nin terms of geography (e.g. as urban and rural areas), by gender, by age, by skill level, by firm size, and\nin general, by different vulnerable groups in society, among others” (pp. 4-5). The European Network\nfor Rural Development (2017) refers to rural areas based on facing the risk of a “double digital divide”,\nlacking  access  to  modern  infrastructure  which  leads  to  “lack  the  basic  skills  and  knowledge  of  the\npotential of digital technology so that even if the ‘digital highways’ are in place, they may remain under-\nexploited” (p.1).\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe self-assessment survey tool has been through different rounds of quality assurance and peer review\nby subject experts in a way that reflects disciplinary needs in the context of both learning and nursing\nprofessional practice, which can “facilitate increased reproducibility of statistical design and reporting”\n(Hildebrandt and Peroneal (2020, p.1). The conceptual framework and the evidence-building processes\nthat underly the methods used in assessing students' self-perceived digital competencies, have been\npreviously reported in different empirical studies with students from diverse subject areas (such as Law,\nLibrary and Information Science and Nursing) (Martzoukou, 2020; 2021; 2023). The strengths of the\nprocess  of  self-assessment  have  also  been  extensively  discussed  in  previous  research  on  students'\nInternet  skills  development  (Van  Deursen  et  al., 2014)  highlighting  its  value  in  improving  students’\nlearning  (Klenowski,  1995;  Ross,  2006;  JISC,  nd).  However,  within  a  fast-developing  technological\nenvironment,  iterative  changes  of  the  questionnaire  were  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,\naddressing emerging digital skills areas, such as artificial intelligence.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nTo explore experiences of rurality, students were asked to report on the area they mostly lived in when\nthey were a child up to finishing school as this is a time when fundamental digital gaps based on unequal\naccess  to  technology  and  the  internet  would  have  been  created  to  impact  students’  digital  skills\ndevelopment,  disparities,  which  could  be  further  amplified  in  students’  transitions  into  Higher\nEducation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nValidity and rigour\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe  reliability  of  the  amended  survey  instrument  was  tested  using  Cronbach's  alpha.

The lowest value was 0.897 for information literacy (identification\nof different information types) and the highest was for digital wellbeing (0.980) (Table 3). As the sample\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nsize was small with ordinal scale data, non-parametric tests were employed in the analysis (Corder and\nForeman, 2014).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.8**\nSampling\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nEthical considerations\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe research design followed a total population sampling approach with email invitations sent to all\nthe  population  of  Undergraduate  (UG)  and  Postgraduate  (PG)  students  studying  at  the  School  of\nNursing,  Midwifery  and  Paramedic  Practice  at  the  Robert  Gordon  University  in  Aberdeen,  Scotland.\nThe  students  were  recruited  following  a  targeted  approach  which  involved  meeting  them  online,\nduring planned  ‘stage  meetings’  sessions,  designed  as  part  of  their  preparation  for  practice  at  the\nNHS.  An hourly online meeting was organised with each stage group (i.e., Stage 1, 2 and 3, which is\nequivalent  to  Year  1,  2,  and  3)  as  well  with  MSc  students.  During  the  meeting  the  students  were\nbriefed on the purposes, objectives and procedures of the research project and they were then asked\nto  fill  in  an  online  questionnaire  survey.

The  results  were  reported  through  descriptive  statistical  analysis  (frequencies,  valid\npercentages  and median values). Following Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk normality tests,\nthe questionnaire items  did  not  follow  a  normal  distribution  and  therefore,  Mann–Whitney  (U-\ntest)  non-parametric  statistical  test  was  used  to  identify  significant  statistical  differences  between\ndifferent  groups.

The  strongest  area  reported  was  ‘Digital  wellbeing’  with  all  the  items  at  median  4.0\n(‘advanced’). This was followed by ‘Everyday life as a digital citizen’, were most of the items were at\n‘advanced’  level  (median  4.0),  while  three  items  were  at  ‘intermediate’  level:  ‘e-democracy’,  ‘e-\ngovernment’  and  ‘e-employment’  (median  3.0)  and  ‘ICT  Proficiency’  were  two  items  were  found  at\n‘intermediate’  (median  3.0) level: ‘University  management systems’ and ‘Communication  platforms’\nwhile the rest were all at ‘advanced’ level. ‘Digital communication’ was also a strong area for the group\nwith the majority of items reported at ‘advanced’ (median 4.0) level, while three directions were found\nto be at intermediate level.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\n‘Digital identity management’ was mainly at ‘intermediate’ level with two areas at ‘advanced’ (median\n4.0) level: ‘Being aware of the potential positive or negative impact of what you communicate online\non your online reputation’ and ‘Understanding the impact of your online interactions’. ‘Information\nliteracy’,  was  found  at  ‘intermediate’  level,  with  only  a  single  item  performing  at  ‘advanced’  level:\n‘Popular  information’  (median  4.0).  ‘ICT  productivity’,  ‘Digital  Innovation’  and  Digital  Learning  and\nDevelopment’  were  found  to  be  at  ‘intermediate’  level  in  all  items.  ‘Digital  creation’  and  ‘Digital\nresearch skills’, were both at ‘intermediate’ level throughout, expect for the creation of ‘infographics’\nin  the  former  category  and  ‘Using  a  Critical  Appraisal  Tool’  in  the  latter  category,  that  were  both\nreported at ‘basic’ level (median 2.0).

In addition, significant differences were identified in\nfive items within ‘ICT Proficiency’ (Table B2), three items in ‘Digital Innovation’ (Table B9), seven items\nin ‘Digital Communication’ skills (Table B8), five items in ‘Digital creation skills’ (Table B6) and three\nitems  in  ‘Everyday  participation  as  digital  citizens”.  There  were  also  other  individual  items,  where\nsignificant differences were observed: ‘Sharing securely your digital files with others’ (ICT Productivity)\n(Table B3), ‘Finding digital information relevant to your academic studies, using databases’ (Information\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nLiteracy) (Table B5) as well as ‘Organising and storing research raw/open data online’ and ‘Using a survey\ntool’ (Digital Research) (Table B7). It is interesting to note that the direction of the mean rank values of\nthe non-parametric (Man Whitney) test indicated that students who were born in year 2000 or after\nself-assessed higher overall based on their digital competencies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nGrouping Variables\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nIn  relation  to  the  overarching  academic  outcomes  question  ‘Which  level  best  describes  your  digital\nabilities to complete your academic work’ (B13), significant differences were found on the basis of: a)\nage demographics, b) digital challenges experienced in the area in which students mostly lived (e.g.,\nrural/urban  before  joining  the  university  (e.g.,  access  to  electricity,  computer,  laptop,  mobile  more,\ntablet, broadband, basic computer training),  c) digital barriers students had experienced in relation to\nproactively developing their digital skills and d) year of study.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nIn addition, significant differences were observed between first year and continuing students in the\nfollowing digital competencies items, where the former group self-assessed higher:  ‘Digital Creation’\n(one item: ‘Vlog/Podcasts’)  (Table B6), ‘ICT Proficiency’  (one item: ‘Search engines’) (Table B2),  ‘Digital\nInnovation’  (one  item:  ‘Working  collaboratively  on  different  aspects  of  a  creative/innovative\nproject/service  design  &  managing  the  process  as  a  team’)  (Table  B9)  and  ‘Digital  learning  and\ndevelopment’ (one item: ‘Using online tools to record learning events/outcomes and use them for self-\nanalysis, reflection, and showcasing of achievement’) (Table B10). Continuing students, on the other\nhand, only self-assessed higher in two items in ‘Information Literacy’ (‘Scholarly Academic Literature’\nand ‘Professional Literature’) (Table B5) and in one item in ‘Everyday participation as digital citizen’ (‘e-\ndemocracy’) (Table B1).\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nFurthermore, the study employed PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the number of digital\ncompetencies  variables  in  the  dataset  and  Exploratory  Factor  Analysis  (EFA)  for  the  purposes  of\nassessing whether they were representative of each of the of each of the underlying construct. PCA\ntransforms  a  set  of  variables  into  a  smaller  set  of  variables,  called  “principal  components”,  which\naccount for most of the variance in the original variables (Comrey and Lee, 1992). PCA with Varimax\nrotation was employed for grouping the digital competencies constructs. The output of this process is\npresented in Supplementary_material_appendix_C, Tables C1-C12. The use of KMO and Bartlett Test\nof  Sphericity  indicated  that  it  was  possible  to  proceed  with  principal  components  factor  analysis\n(Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007).  Each of the survey constructs were grouped into a single component,\nwhile the single-item factor loadings were quite high.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe  descriptive  statistics  (mean  and  standard  deviation)  of  the  examined  constructs  for  the  entire\nsample are presented in the last two rows of Tables C1-C12. As it can be observed that higher digital\ncompetencies  were\n‘ICT\nfor ‘Digital  Wellbeing’\nProficiency’ (mean = 3.64). Low competencies were reported for ‘Digital Creation’ skills (mean = 2.77)\nand ‘Digital Research’ skills (mean = 2.87).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nreported\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nPearson  correlation  coefficients  and  the  corresponding  significance  levels  for  all  the  construct\ncomponents are presented in Table C13 with Pearson's test (2-tailed) at significance level p < 0.05(*)\nand significance level p < 0.01(**). It is worth noting that strong statistically significant correlations at\nlevel p < 0.01(**)  were  identified  between  almost  all  the  self-reported  dimensions  of  digital\ncompetencies,  encompassing  digital  skills  that  were  related  to  everyday  life  digital  activities  to  ICT\nproficiency  and  productivity,  information  literacy,  and  digital  creation,  research  communication,\ninnovation, identity management and wellbeing.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.2**r== 0.4**\nWhat would empower students to further develop their digital skills\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nIn the survey, students answered an open-ended question which helped to contextualize the above\nfindings. The question centered on ways that would empower them to further develop their digital\nskills.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nStudents mentioned several digital skills areas they would need further support with or training on,\nincluding learning new software/tools and understanding university systems (e.g., Moodle). Digital skills\ndevelopment  was  centred  on  completing  coursework,  such  as  preparing  online  posters  and\npresentations (PowerPoint) and formatting information, using referencing tools (such as RefWorks),\ndeveloping online database searching skills/library searching, data analysis (e.g. Microsoft Excel), digital\nproductivity tools for note-taking and time management. In relation to digital creativity tasks, several\nskills  mentioned  addressed  blogs,  podcasts  and  creating  videos,  while  in  relation  to  digital\ncommunication,  students  referred  to  skills  for  using  social  media  and  for  digital  learning  and\ndevelopment (e.g., e-portfolio).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nRespondents also offered ideas for different preferred types of training including workbooks/tutorials,\npresentations,  bitesize  guides,  video  guides  and  tutorials,  as  well  as  online  training  and  courses,  in-\nperson  sessions  and  one-to-one  support.  Whatever  the  method  proposed,  students  preferred  clear\nexplanations,  “consistent  information\",  and  “accessible  interfaces”,  while  several  respondents\nmentioned tailored support that is relevant to their careers. In addition, students’ comments indicated\nthat  digital  skills  should  be  taught  early  in  a  course  and    in  collaboration:  “Taught  earlier  and  in\ncollaboration with study skills and the library”, “Teach more in first year to help us build every year we\nstudy more sessions when beginning uni to go over how to use the systems”, “Incorporating structured\ndigital skills education and identification of beneficial skills from the beginning of the course”, “Study\nskills and library support to teach a class at the start of each academic year as a reminder”. In addition,\nmore time dedicated to digital skills development was necessary: “What would empower me would be\nmore  time  to  do  digital  skills”,  “More  time  -  life/study  balance”,  “More  time  to  practice”.  Personal\nmotivation to develop digital skills was equally deemed important. As one student explained: “I decide\nwhat I feel is relevant for me to know and the things that I have self-assessed as lower are not important\nor useful to me”, indicating that a low score on certain digital skills could mean that students were not\nengaged with the particular skills, or they deemed them necessary or unimportant:\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nStudents required an “interest to learn” which could be triggered by connecting these skills to their\ncourse  related  experiences  together  with  reassurance  and  guidance  that  they  were  “in  the  right\ndirection”. As students also explained, digital skills classes could be part of a course: “Incorporate these\nclasses into our timetable” and, in that way, students could be “given time within the module to learn\nthat skill”, especially if “an assignment was in line with a digital literacy skill that I’m lacking”. In addition,\nteaching staff could use more advanced and interactive tools that would “inspire” them to “develop\ndigital  skills  in  these  areas”  and  “actively  involve”  students  “in  digital  learning  and  collaboration\ninitiatives - e.g., sharing project results online”. Interestingly, beyond embedding digital skills into the\nstudy programme, students’ perspectives overall, conveyed a sense of connecting the significance of\ndigital skills to the purposes of academic study rather than to digitally-enabled nursing practice.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\n“I don't know I don't use certain things or have interest in doing blogs or podcasts etc so that’s why I\nscore low in sections related to that not sure really not interested in using many online tools I like pen\nand paper”.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\n“Motivation for using these tools is lacking for me.

First  level  digital  divides  were  identified  in  17%  (n=97)  of  the  study\npopulation, who reported having experienced digital challenges prior to joining the university (such as\naccess to electricity, computer, laptop, mobile more, tablet, broadband, basic computer training), while\n77.9% (n=431) reported experiences of at least one second-level barrier to developing their digital skills\n(e.g., lack of time, training, interest, urgency, confidence, task complexity) (Table 2).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nSignificant statistical differences were also found in second level digital barriers and self-assessed digital\ncompetences, indicating that students who had experienced at least one of the listed barriers in that\ncategory (e.g., lack of time, training, interest, confidence) were more likely to self-report lower digital\ncompetencies than students who did not encounter any challenges.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nGeographical location was not found to directly play a role in the way in which students self-assessed\nspecific digital competencies, although they had an impact on the digital abilities self-assessment of\nstudents  for  overall  completing  academic  work.  Significant  statistical  differences  were  identified\nbetween  students  who  experienced  at  least  one  of  the  listed  first  level  digital  divides  (e.g.,  lack  of\ncontinuous access to electricity, access to a desktop computer, smart mobile phone, tablet broadband,\nor basic computer training) and self-assessed digital competencies. Students who encountered digital\nchallenges/divides were more likely to self-report lower digital competencies than students who did\n‘Everyday  participation  as  digital  citizens’\nin\nnot.  The  most  notable  differences  were\n(Supplementary_material_appendix_B, Table B1), ‘Digital Creation’ (Table B6) and ‘Digital Innovation’\n(Table B9), where statistically significant correlations were found across all question items. These were\nfollowed  by  ‘ICT  Proficiency’  (Table  B2)  and  ‘Digital  Identity  Management’  (Table  B11),  where  all\nquestion items, except for one, were found significant. Additionally, there were three items identified\nin ‘ICT Productivity’ (Table B3), ‘Digital Research’ (Table B7), and ‘Digital Communication (Table B8),\ntwo items in ‘Information Literacy’ (Table B5) and ‘Digital Learning and Development’ (Table B10) and\none item in ‘Digital wellbeing’ (Table B12).\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nLearning disabilities (neurodivergence) were not found to play a role in students’ digital competencies\nself-assessments  as  no  significant  differences  were  identified  based  on  that  variable,  although\ntransitions are reported as a significant issue for neurodivergent students in previous research (Bakker\net  al.  2023).  However,  students  shared  additional  ideas,  which  helped  to  further  contextualize  the\nfindings  in  the  area  of  digital  divides  connected  to  learning  disabilities.  For  example,  different\nchallenges they experienced with ICT proficiency and productivity, such as keeping focused on tasks\nand avoiding distractions and reading on screen (Supplementary_material_appendix_D, Table D1):\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nA total of 89 students (16.1%) self-reported a neurodiverse condition, while 82 (14.8%) indicated that\nthey may be neurodivergent, but they are not sure, or they have not been formally diagnosed.

This research also offered a better\nunderstanding of how students may transfer into HE existing digital divides from everyday life in a way\nthat may have an impact on their follow up digital literacy development; these highlight the need for\nfurther  learning  opportunities  to  develop  digital  skills  that  meet  the  expectations  of  the  nursing\nprofession,  particularly  with  the  emergence  of  new  innovative  technologies  and  AI  related\ntransformations that require advanced digital skills (Rony, Parvin and Ferdousi, 2024).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThis study sought to explore how nursing students self-assess based on their digital competencies and\nto further understand any existing obstacles to digital literacy development they encountered. Digital\nexclusion in Higher Education has been examined in previous research, however, most frequently, at\nthe level of technological infrastructure and internet connectivity and in relation global geographical\ndivisions created between the Global North and the Global South countries (Thomas-Slayter, 2003),\nwhere  people  are  more  likely  to  experience  poverty  and  limited  access  to  resources  or  educational\nopportunities (ACU, 2020, Lembani et. al., 2020). At EU level, it has been reported that digital divides\nbased on accessibility have been reduced over the last years, however, there is still a fundamental need\nfor upskilling, with one of the four key goals of the European Commission (2021) focusing on “a digitally\nskilled population and highly-skilled digital professionals”.\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nSignificant differences were also observed in relation to age demographics, with younger students self-\nassessing  their  digital  competencies  at  a  higher  level  overall.  In  addition,  first  year  students  self-\nassessed higher than continuing students in certain digital skills areas, which required digital creation,\nICT proficiency and innovation skills, while continuing students were stronger in information literacy,\nwhich  presents  a  fundamental  academic  skill,  especially  in  nursing  education  and  practice,  where\nevidence-based practice is a core direction in clinical decision making and for the delivery of quality\nhealthcare  (Majid  et  al.,  2011).  On  the  other  hand,  research  skills  did  not  appear  to  be  an  area  of\nstrength of students, possibly because most of the students were UG and in their first year of study.\nThis signifies a need to develop more robust strategies for supporting students at early levels to excel\nin  digital  research  foundational  skills.  Further  research  replicating  this  methodology  could  further\nexplore this outcome with diverse students at different study levels.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThis  research  also  offered  a  deeper  contextual  understanding  of  the  diverse  range  of  digital  skills\nchallenges  and  the  variability  of  strategies  followed  by  neurodivergent  students  which  signifies  the\nneed for a universal design to nursing education to accommodate diverse needs and requirements of\nall learners (Halligan et al., 2019). In this study students’ existing neurodiverse conditions did not appear\nto  play  a  role  in  the  way  in  which  they  self-assessed  their  digital  competencies.  This  adds  some\nadditional  evidence  to  the  position  that  people  with  neurodiverse  conditions  do  not  necessarily\nencounter challenges in their development of digital skills more broadly and may instead be presented\nwith unique opportunities in digital tech employment environments that require digital innovation and\ncreativity  (Autism  Network  Scotland,  n.d.).  Despite  this  result,  neurodivergent  students  described\ndifferent  barriers  they  experienced  particularly  within  the  areas  of  ‘ICT  proficiency’  and  ‘ICT\nproductivity’,  where  they  recommended  available  tools  and  strategies  that  can  assist  in  keeping\nfocused on tasks and avoiding distractions. These suggestions can assist in developing more tailored\nand informed digital skills support. They also offered personal strategies for overcoming these barriers,\nwhich provide helpful insights and directions for digital skills programme development. It is important\nto  cater  for  these  challenges  in  a  way  that  is  different  according  to  the  individual  neurodivergent\nconditions of students.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nOverall, the strong statistical correlations between the self-reported digital competencies dimensions\nin  this  study,  offered  empirical  evidence  of  the  interplay  between  everyday  life,  learning  and  work-\nrelated digital competencies, putting forward the need for a more holistic approach to the teaching of\ndigital skills in nursing education. Previous research with nursing students has mainly placed emphasis\non  individual  digital  skills,  such  as  “digital  professionalism”  (Mather  et  al,  2018),  electronic  health\nliteracy (Anderberg et al. 2019, p. 5), or information literacy (Aylward et al. (2020), centred on “the\nreliability and validity of online health care information” (Blakemore et al., 2020). Other research has\nexplored the socio-emotional factors on students’ digital literacy, such their awareness of digital issues\nin the online environment (Erdat, 2023; Okumus and Atılgan, 2021; Park, 2013).\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe  above  findings  offer  important  directions  for  the  nature  of  support  that  academic  libraries  can\nprovide  for  nursing  students’  development  of  digital  competencies.  The  most\nimportant\nrecommendation  addresses  the  need  to  design  tailored  digital  literacy  programmes  which  focus  on\nspecific digital skills, such as digital creation and digital research and in a way that carers for the needs\nof different students (e.g., first year and continuing students).  Digital literacy programs should not only\nbe offered at an appropriate knowledge level, but also support nursing students to develop awareness\nof state-of-the art knowledge of digital tools and methodologies for healthcare, such as evidence-based\npractice,  predictive  analytics  and  artificial  intelligence  for  patient  care  and  clinical  decision-making\n(Agnew, 2022). Finally, more emphasis is necessary in promoting the importance of continuous learning\nand  upskilling  in  digital  competencies  and  the  relevance  of  advanced  digital  skills  in  the  context  of\nemerging  technologies  and  transformations  in  healthcare.  Current  research  points  to  evidence  that\nlibrary  support  has  a  positive  impact  on  nursing  students’  information  literacy  skill  development\n(Purnell, Royal and Warton (2020). However, information literacy skills development takes place within\nthe  context  of  developing  a  range  of  digital  skills  that  involve  other  interrelated  skills,  such  as  ICT\nproficiency, digital communication and digital learning and development, among others. Approaching\nthe development of digital skills holistically means working synergistically with students and adopting\na  learner-centered  approach  that  identifies  and  addresses  existing  gaps  in  information  and  digital\nliteracy.  This  approach  necessitates  nurturing  a  lifelong  learning  mindset  in  students  to  ensure\ncontinuous skills development.\n**BLOCK**fs== 49.5**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nJournal of Documentation\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThere is not a one-fits-all approach to digital competencies development, as not one student is similar\nbecause of their individual characteristics and life experiences. However, developing a more informed\nunderstanding  of  students’  digital  competencies  gaps  and  the  multiple  shapes  that  digital  exclusion\nmay take is important for the design of meaningful digital skills enhancement programmes in Higher\nEducation.  As this study showed, digital competencies were not only multidimensional, complex and\ninterrelated, but also influenced by diverse digital challenges and barriers. The results of this study put\nforward  the  importance  of  libraries  collaborating  with  schools  for  offering  a  discipline-based  and\ntailored scaffolding approach to the development of nursing students’ digital competencies, as opposed\nto a ‘one fits-all’, generic or baseline direction. Higher Education should focus on equipping students\nwith discipline related digital skills and knowledge in a way that relates to students’ future professional\ntrajectories and ensure a “digitally fluent workforce” (Lokmic-Tomkins, et al., 2021), not only a digitally\nfluent student. It should also develop increased awareness of the digital barriers and experiences that\nstudents encounter within their everyday lives. This involves a continuous engagement with evolving\ndigital skills needs in the profession and a focus on students’ learning and development for life. Future\nresearch  should  explore  the  parameters  of  interrelated  digital  skills  withing  everyday  life  and  work\nenvironments and examine how experiences within different settings influence strategies for students’\nongoing learning and professional growth.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.8**\nConclusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nFinally,  it  is  important  to  note  that,  although  this  study  explored  nursing  students,  its  design  and\nfindings  are  relevant  and  applicable  to  digital  divides  that  may  be  present  in  other  student\npopulations. Digital  competencies  is  a  critical  skillset  for  students  across  different  disciplines  and\nnot  unique  to nursing,  and,  as  changing  digital  technologies  become  integral  to  different  aspects\nof  learning  and  diverse  professional  practice,  it  is  important    to  develop  tailored  digital  literacy\nsupport, informed by detailed  understanding  of  students’  development  needs,  in  a  way  that  relates\nmeaningfully to their study directions, their future professional trajectories and their individual\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nknowledge levels and skills.  The research methodology applied in this study has already been tested\nwith  other  student  populations  with  the  aim  to  explore  pockets  of  digital  inequalities  across\ndifferent  discipline  areas,  such  as  Law  (Martzoukou  et  al.,  2022)  and  Information  Science\n(Martzoukou et al. 2020), with the input of academic staff/students  and  with  the  aim  to  offer  digital\nliteracy  training  and  support  and  enhance  students’  digital  capacity  as  future  professionals.  In\naddition,  the  study’s  novel  insights  into  the  digital  challenges  that  neurodivergent  students\nencounter  demonstrates  the  necessity  for\ninclusive  educational  strategies,  in  a  way  that  can\nbe  applied  to  other  fields  beyond  nursing,  to  ensure  that  all  students, regardless of their learning\nneeds, have equal opportunities to develop essential digital competencies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.8**\nReferences\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nAnderberg, P., Eivazzadeh, S., & Berglund, J.

Digital divides in nursing students: an exploration of the relationship between self-perceived digital competencies and digital barriers   Journal of Documentation   Digital divides in nursing students: an exploration of the relationship between self-perceived digital competencies and digital barriers   In the context of Higher Education nursing education, digital competencies are increasingly recognised as  a  necessary  skillset,  within  a  continuously  evolving  healthcare  professional  landscape.  This  study sought to explore nursing students’ digital competencies and to further understand the digital literacy gaps and barriers they encounter for both learning and future work.   The  research  involved  a  cross  sectional,  discipline-based  empirical  study  of  nursing  students’  self- assessed digital competencies via a questionnaire survey, which collected quantitative and qualitative data from a total of five hundred and fifty-three students. The study explored the role of demographics (age, urban/rural geographical location of growing up, study year, learning disabilities (neurodiversity) and experiences of digital divides (e.g., access, contextual and behavioural barriers) play on students’ digital competencies and outcomes.   Journal of Documentation   Students’ digital competencies were found at intermediate level with younger and first year students self-assessing higher. Significant differences were identified between students who had encountered digital  barriers/divides  and  those  who  had  not,  with  the  former,  self-reporting  lower  digital competencies. Students with learning disabilities reported complex support needs for processing and organizing digital information and for productivity. Almost all the individual digital competencies items assessed had strong statistical correlations between them.   The research offers key recommendations for academic libraries for the on-going, evolving exploration of  students’  digital  competencies  and  for  the  need  to  follow  tailored,  discipline-related,  holistic, practice-based  and  curriculum  embedded  approaches  to  students’  digital  skills  development  and support.  It  provides  novel  insights  into  digital  competencies  development  for  nursing  students  and particularly those who experience digital divides.   Within the context of university nursing education, digital competencies are increasingly recognised as a necessary skillset for studying, keeping up with technological advancements (Harrison, 2024; RCN, 2024)  and  developing  an  “ability  to  adapt  and  innovate”  (Hughes  2024),  preparing  students  for  the future  healthcare  professional  landscape  and  for  roles  that  demand  digital  skills  in  the  provision  of effective nursing care (Isidori et al, 2022; RCN, 2021). The rapid digital transformation caused by the pandemic necessitated digital competence development needs in both nursing education and practice with changes that are “likely to be sustained”, while the need for nurses who have “digital expertise and  the  ability  to  lead  change  is  increasing  exponentially”  (NHS  England,  n.d.).  Within  the  next  two decades,  most  jobs  in  the  UK  National  Health  System  (NHS)  will  have  a  digital  component,  as  staff navigate  a  data-rich  healthcare  environment  and  develop  digital  competence  skills  for  fast  growing technologically  enhanced  work  settings  (Topol  Review,  2019)  dealing  with  increased  digital  data (Capgemini, 2022) and a “digital future” that “is already transforming the way nursing care is delivered” (RCN, 2024).  A priority area for the health and care sector is, therefore, “when, why and, crucially, how to use digital”, with essential digital workforce development (Scottish Government, 2021).   The Code of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (2023) identifies digital skills as integral for all registered nurses, however, a lack of formal digital competencies training structure in nursing education results in fragmented  digital  knowledge  and  experiences  (De  Leeuw  et  al.,  2022).  Frustration  with  new  and ongoing integration of technology and lack of confidence/skills with healthcare technology is associated with emotional exhaustion among nurses in practice (Tawfik et al. 2021). Among nursing students, who prepare for increasingly digitalised future careers, the existence of digital divides also creates significant challenges (Saeed and Masters, 2021). Despite the widespread presence of digital technology in nursing students' lives, students still experience gaps even in baseline digital literacy (NMC, 2023). For example, targeted digital literacy education interventions around technology-enhanced learning and simulation are needed as part of foundational nursing studies to improve nursing students' baseline digital literacy before commencing clinical placement (Lokmic-Tomkins et al., 2022).   Journal of Documentation   Academic libraries have established expertise in developing subject support for nursing and offering training for students on the basis of health information literacy (Purnell, Royal and Warton, 2020), such as how to identify database search techniques across different health related sources, using effective search approaches (e.g., Boolean operators and advanced searching), and how to evaluate and ethically use information following referencing standards and academic integrity. However, health information literacy is also a crucial professional skill for the delivery of evidence-based health information services (e.g.,  systematic  literature  reviews).  Academic  libraries  have  been  supporting  nursing  students  to develop  different  digital  skills  to  navigate  broader  technological  developments,  from  using  internet search engines and Web 2.0 to sourcing and analysing big data and to the use of digital health services for their potential to advance clinical practice and the delivery of patient care as well as the current focus  on  the  ethical  use  of  generative  artificial  intelligence  for  information  discovery  (e.g.,  using  AI Search Tools). Davenport and Kalakota (2019) discuss the opportunities created by Natural language processing (NLP) in the health professional environment for “understanding and classification of clinical documentation and published research” for the purpose, for example, of analyzing unstructured clinical notes,  reports  and  patient  interactions.  Academic  libraries  empower  students  to  engage  with technology,  explore  digital  content,  and  develop  their  digital  literacy  skills.  Increasingly,  academic libraries  have  also  started  to  develop  support  and  guidance  in  the  form  of  LibGuides  that  focus  on navigating the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. For example, the University of Cambridge libraries offer guidance on the use of AI answering questions such as which AI tools to use, how to get the best results from AI and how to reference AI tools (University of Cambridge 2023). Subject specific Libguides in health developed by academic libraries, aim to increase awareness of how it is currently transforming   To realise the true potential of digitally enabled health and social care services, it becomes necessary to develop a unified and concentrated effort to transform the education and skills provision for those working in delivering health and social care (Morrison et al., 2022). This necessitates a deeper and on- going exploration of nursing students’ development needs and readiness to apply digital skills within a constantly evolving nursing education and professional environment.   healthcare with new applications and advancements which enhance health related clinical practice and as well as evidence-based research (e.g., systematic reviews) (Khalil, Ameen, & Zarnegar, 2022).  For example, King’s College Libraries and Collections (2024) offers access to AI tools for evidence synthesis providing resources for health students on AI tools and how to use them for learning, research and healthcare related practice.   However,  developing  library  support  and  implementing  digital  skills  programmes  necessitates understanding of students’ existing digital skills gaps. Not all students arrive to education with the same digital skills and competencies and therefore, ongoing critical exploration of existing digital divides and needs is crucial for offering meaningful digital literacy programmes and support.   Recent research exploring the development of nursing students’ digital skills or competencies has found variability in focus and directions (Matthews 2021; Nes, 2021) and a lack of a holistic approach to digital literacy skills development in academia. For example, in a scoping review of technological literacy in nursing  education,  Nes  identified  several  different  foci,  including  computer  literacy,  health/nursing informatics  and  technology  acceptance,  while  a  direction  towards  higher  level  digital  skills,  such  as problem-solving and critical thinking was omitted. Similarly, Harerimana et al. (2022) highlighted a need to incorporate digital literacy education beyond basic computer, internet and digital device use–related skills, while Brown et al. (2020) noticed the lack of advanced/more specialised digital skills for transferal to the clinical/care working environment. Other research has emphasised gaps in students’ knowledge on eHealth literacy (Holt et al., 2020; Jeon and Kim, 2022; Mather et al., 2022; Blakemore et al., 2020) and students’ attitudes to technology (Lekalakala-Mokgele et al., 2023). However, overall, studies are inconclusive  as  the  methodologies  and  measurements  followed  are  either  dissimilar  or  focused  on different digital skills required (Erdat et al., 2023).   Journal of Documentation   Bove  and  Sauer  (2023)  explored  levels  of  knowledge  and  skills  that  nursing  academic  staff  should possess to teach their students, and the need for both educators and nursing practitioners to embrace AI-enabled innovations to “lead the digital future” (Castonguay et al., 2023). The need for continuous education  has  been  identified  for  years  as  a  priority  in  the  European  agenda  to  digitize  healthcare (European Health Parliament, 2016, p.8) with a call for mandatory, continuous and tailored training programs on digital skills. At UK level, however, although “Digital health is a high priority in government, NHS  organisations  and  Royal  Colleges”  there  is  a  gap  between  expectations  around  digital  skills development and the actual implementation of education within school curricula and training for staff via professional development activities. Post pandemic, the need for digital health education is even greater with remote health consultations and digital health solutions (Holland Brown and Bewick, 2022, p.214).   Despite the urgent call for the ongoing development of digital skills, “digital divides” amongst the health and  social  care  workforce  (including  nurses)  still  exist.  For  example,  in  relation  to  the  geographical interest of this study, NHS Education for Scotland indicates a digital literacy skills gap in the healthcare sector, with key findings from a large-scale digital skills user research study (Digital Health and Care, 2022), which indicates both a lack of digital skills training and agreed terminology which can result in digital  exclusion,  manifested  though  lack  of  engagement  or  confidence,  competence  and  access (Capgemini, 2022).   To support nursing students building digital competencies as future professionals operating within a complex digitally enabled health arena, a holistic understanding of digital skills, gaps and barriers is required, focusing on moving from baseline to more advanced digital literacy skills development and to an  effective  transition  towards  technologically  advanced  health  working  environments  (Lokmic- Tomkins et al. 2022). This study therefore aims to offer a better understanding of nursing students’ different levels of digital competencies and explore how digital exclusion experiences may play a role in the way in which they develop them.   Aims and Objectives   This research presents an approach that aims to explore students’ diverse digital competencies that are key  for  learning  and  for  supporting  a  digital  evolving  professional  environment,  as  well  as  examine students’  diverse  experiences  of  digital  divides.  Specifically,  the  research  addresses  the  following objectives:   In relation to Objectives 2 and 3, two working hypotheses were put forward:   H2.  Self-assessed  digital  competencies  of  students  will  be  correlated  with  demographic  differences (age, learning disabilities (neurodiversity), geographical location and study year).   H1. Self-assessed digital competencies of students will be correlated with students’ experienced digital divides/barriers  (age,  learning  disabilities  (neurodiversity),  urban/rural  geographical  location  of growing up and study year).   To explore how nursing students self-assess their digital competencies for nursing related learning and professional practice. To examine nursing students’ digital barriers/divides related to technological access and connectivity (first level divide), digital competencies development (second-level divide), and digital outcomes (third-level digital divide) To identify the impact of students’ demographic divides on their digital competencies’ development.   Journal of Documentation   The  main  position  of  this  research  is  that  students  do  not  arrive  at  university  with  the  same  digital competencies  and  that  it  is  important  to  consider  the  issue  of  “widening  participation”  and  “digital inclusion”  in  nursing  education.   Previous  research  with  students  has  found  that  they  have  positive attitudes  and  feel  competent  towards  information  and  communication  technology  use  in  clinical practice to support care values and work efficiency (Warshawski et al., 2019). However, not only the digital  environment  is  constantly  evolving,  but  also  more  recent  studies  have  extended  a  focus  on technological skills to cover additional areas of digital capability that have a behavioural and “soft skills” focus, encompassing digital “learning and development”, “identity and wellbeing”, “problem solving and innovation”, “information, data and media literacies” and “digital communication, collaboration and  participation”.  These  emphasise  the  importance  of  improving  students’  digital  capabilities  to enhance  their  self-efficacy,  confidence  and  self-actualization  in  their  academic  studies  (Ibrahim  and Aldawsari, 2023).   This study followed a cross-sectional survey of nursing students by means of an online questionnaire administered  to  all  students  studying  in  undergraduate  (Year  1,  2  and  3)  and  postgraduate  nursing courses within a single Scottish HE institution. The questionnaire instrument collected quantitative and qualitative data in a concurrent mixed methodological survey design, with a) closed ended questions exploring students’ demographics (age, learning disabilities (neurodiversity), urban/rural geographical location of growing up and study year), students’ self-perceived digital competencies, and digital divide barriers  and  b)  open-ended  questions  which  aimed  to  examine,  in  more  detail,  challenges  and strategies of students with learning disabilities/neurodiversity.   Digital competencies   In this study, we utilised an empirically tested digital competencies self-assessment survey tool that was adapted based on the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (Carretero et al., 2017) and The Digital Capabilities framework (JISC, 2022) to holistically explore digital competencies from a nursing-based  perspective.  The  survey  explored  digital  competencies  within  everyday  life,  nursing related education and practice, addressing nursing related digital competencies with examples from the context of nursing: for example, the use of health related information sources (such as CINAHL,   Medline, Cochrane Library), the application of digital creation skills in nursing (such as those for using simulation/virtual reality tools and discipline specific apps, e.g.,  BNF British National Formulary) and for the use of health digital research skills (such as those for using health specific critical appraisal tools, e.g., Critical Appraisals Skills Programme (CASP) and evidence-based research tools). The structure and the  dimensions  of  the  questionnaire  survey  are  available  in  Supplementary_material_appendix_A, Table A1. The survey measurement was based on a five-point Likert type scale of digital competencies which  represented  different  levels  of  knowledge  and  self-sufficiency  based  on  performing  specific digital tasks (Supplementary_material_appendix_A, Table A2).   Digital barriers/divides   Third-level digital divides were explored via an overarching question that addressed students’ overall digital abilities to fulfil academic outcomes (Supplementary_material_appendix_A, Table A1).   Wei,  Chan  and  Tan  (2011)  highlight  three  potential  levels  of  digital  divide  including  access  to information technology (first level divide), digital capability (second-level divide), and digital outcomes (third-level digital divide) which relate to learning and productivity. In relation to first level divides, data in the survey were collected on information technology access barriers experienced by students related to an urban/rural divide (up to the time of finishing school), such as lack of access to electricity, and access to basic computer training, broadband, desktop computers/laptop, and smart mobile phones use (Sparks, 2013, p.28; DiMaggio et al. 2010; Wei, Chan and Tan, 2011). Second-level divides were explored by means of identifying self-assessed digital competencies gaps, described above, which were further elaborated based on contextual and behavioural barriers students experienced in developing them,  such  as  lack  of  time,  up-to-date  training  in  specific  digital  skills  (Gilmour  et  al.,  2008)  and students’  interest,  urgency,  confidence  and  their  perceptions  of  difficulty  around  developing  these skills. These questions helped to explore more holistically intersecting digital divides variables that may play a role in students’ digital competencies development.   Journal of Documentation   The impact of age demographics, may be difficult to delineate with different studies following diverse ways of categorising age groupings (Dimock, 2019). This study focused on a binary categorisation, given the focus of the research on digital skills and digital connectivity: students born before the year 2000 and students born in that year or after (which characterises approximately the start of Generation Z learners) (Shorey et al., 2021). The change of the millennium marked an important technological shift in everyday life digital access and interaction, with the widespread adoption and use of the Internet, digital technologies and social media. People born after the change of the millennium had experiences of growing up in a more technologically saturated world and this may have shaped up for them different online experiences. Prensky describes these individuals as ‘Digital Natives’, in other words the “native speakers” of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet” and the first generation to grow up with these new technologies (2001a; 2001b).  In a literature review of 80 studies, Alruthaya, Nguyen and Lokuge (2021) reported on different research where Gen Z students were found “to be able to access digital technologies more than other generations” (Sakdiyakorn et al., 2021), noting a preference  towards  visual  versus  textual  information  (Hernandez-de-Menendez  et  al.,  2020).  Other studies focusing on nursing students have reported differences in both everyday life digital activities, such  as  using  daily  social  media  (Vizcaya-Moreno  and  Pérez-Cañaveras,  2020)  and  preferences  for specific learning approaches, such as experiential learning, independent learning and use of multimedia (Hampton and Keys, 2017).   Age demographics divides   Learning disabilities (neurodivergence) divides   The  study  also  sought  to  explore  potential  first  and  second-level  digital  divides  within  the underrepresented  15-20%  neurodivergent  student  population  (Doyle,  2020).  Despite  the  high incidence  of  neurodivergence  in  students  attending  universities  internationally  (which  is  growing), there  appears  a  dearth  of  neurodivergent  pedagogical  literature  (Hamilton  and  Petty  2023).   Neurodiversity “is an umbrella term that represents the neurological variability of the human brain” which includes many terms such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, dyspraxia, epilepsy, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Lukava, et al., 2022 p.76) and can be formally diagnosed or a self-reported protected characteristic (Equality Act, 2010). Although there are various statistics, it is suggested that 15-20% of the population is reported as neurodivergent (Doyle, 2020).   Divides related to rural/urban experiences of growing up   Students were asked to first indicate if they had a neurodivergent condition (actual or suspected) in one or more of the following areas: autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia and Attention Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD).  Following  that,  the  students  were  asked  to  explain  if  they encountered  any  problems,  difficulties  or  barriers  when  completing  digital  tasks/using  digital  tools related to their study.  Finally, students were asked to list any apps, programmes, or digital tools that helped them as a neurodivergent person or any other elements that supported their life or learning that  they  felt  might  also  be  useful  to  others  (e.g.,  for  accessibility,  time  management,  study organisation/prioritisation, visualisation).   The presence of a “urban/rural digital divide” is “widely acknowledged” in previous research (Philip et al.  2017,  p.386)  and  policy  (ITU,  2020)  as  a  determining  factor  for  digital  skills  development.  For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2021) has described the term “digital divide” as “different levels of access and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and, most often, to the gaps in access and use of Internet-based digital services” which can “vary in terms of geography (e.g. as urban and rural areas), by gender, by age, by skill level, by firm size, and in general, by different vulnerable groups in society, among others” (pp. 4-5). The European Network for Rural Development (2017) refers to rural areas based on facing the risk of a “double digital divide”, lacking  access  to  modern  infrastructure  which  leads  to  “lack  the  basic  skills  and  knowledge  of  the potential of digital technology so that even if the ‘digital highways’ are in place, they may remain under- exploited” (p.1).   Journal of Documentation   The self-assessment survey tool has been through different rounds of quality assurance and peer review by subject experts in a way that reflects disciplinary needs in the context of both learning and nursing professional practice, which can “facilitate increased reproducibility of statistical design and reporting” (Hildebrandt and Peroneal (2020, p.1). The conceptual framework and the evidence-building processes that underly the methods used in assessing students' self-perceived digital competencies, have been previously reported in different empirical studies with students from diverse subject areas (such as Law, Library and Information Science and Nursing) (Martzoukou, 2020; 2021; 2023). The strengths of the process  of  self-assessment  have  also  been  extensively  discussed  in  previous  research  on  students' Internet  skills  development  (Van  Deursen  et  al., 2014)  highlighting  its  value  in  improving  students’ learning  (Klenowski,  1995;  Ross,  2006;  JISC,  nd).  However,  within  a  fast-developing  technological environment,  iterative  changes  of  the  questionnaire  were  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  this  study, addressing emerging digital skills areas, such as artificial intelligence.   To explore experiences of rurality, students were asked to report on the area they mostly lived in when they were a child up to finishing school as this is a time when fundamental digital gaps based on unequal access  to  technology  and  the  internet  would  have  been  created  to  impact  students’  digital  skills development,  disparities,  which  could  be  further  amplified  in  students’  transitions  into  Higher Education.   Validity and rigour   The  reliability  of  the  amended  survey  instrument  was  tested  using  Cronbach's  alpha.  The  results showed that all item groups in the questionnaire had a Cronbach's alpha index much higher than 0.7, with almost all the values above 0.9. The lowest value was 0.897 for information literacy (identification of different information types) and the highest was for digital wellbeing (0.980) (Table 3). As the sample   size was small with ordinal scale data, non-parametric tests were employed in the analysis (Corder and Foreman, 2014).   Ethical considerations   The research design followed a total population sampling approach with email invitations sent to all the  population  of  Undergraduate  (UG)  and  Postgraduate  (PG)  students  studying  at  the  School  of Nursing,  Midwifery  and  Paramedic  Practice  at  the  Robert  Gordon  University  in  Aberdeen,  Scotland. The  students  were  recruited  following  a  targeted  approach  which  involved  meeting  them  online, during planned  ‘stage  meetings’  sessions,  designed  as  part  of  their  preparation  for  practice  at  the NHS.  An hourly online meeting was organised with each stage group (i.e., Stage 1, 2 and 3, which is equivalent  to  Year  1,  2,  and  3)  as  well  with  MSc  students.  During  the  meeting  the  students  were briefed on the purposes, objectives and procedures of the research project and they were then asked to  fill  in  an  online  questionnaire  survey.  The  sample  consisted  of  555  students  out  of  the  potential population  of  964  UG  students  and  32  PG  registered  students  in  the  school,  representing  a  total response  rate  of  55.5%  (two  respondents,  however,  were  removed  from  this  sample  due  to insufficient  data).  The  rationale  for  inviting  all  students  was  that  they  attended  diverse  courses covering  adult,  mental  health,  and  children  and  young  people’s  nursing  and  it  was  important  to ensure  adequate  representation  from  all  groups  and  capture, in  a  holistic  way,  different perspectives  on  digital  competencies  development  and  experiences  that  related  to  digital  divide barriers. Detailed demographic characteristics are provided in Table 1. The survey was administered in June 2023 with student voluntary and anonymous participation and informed online consent.   Journal of Documentation   IBM SPSS Statistics (v28) was employed for the statistical analysis of the survey data (IBM Corp, 2022) to  explore  correlations  between  age  and  study  year  demographic  data,  digital  competencies  and digital divides. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal consistency reliability of the survey tool.  The  results  were  reported  through  descriptive  statistical  analysis  (frequencies,  valid percentages  and median values). Following Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk normality tests, the questionnaire items  did  not  follow  a  normal  distribution  and  therefore,  Mann–Whitney  (U- test)  non-parametric  statistical  test  was  used  to  identify  significant  statistical  differences  between different  groups.  A  p  value  of  <.05  was  followed  to  indicate  statistical  significance  for  all  the  tests. Principal components analysis (PCA)  following  the  varimax  orthogonal  rotation  method  was  used to  identify  groups  of  digital competencies in (Supplementary_material_appendix_B, Tables B1-13). We  considered  factors  reaching  eigenvalue  1  as  a  factor  extraction  method  following  Kaiser’s criterion.  The  results  of  Bartlett’s sphericity test at p < 0.05 and the Kaiser Meyer–Olkin (value of 0.6 or above) confirmed the suitability of  our  dataset  for  structure  detection.  Bivariate  correlation statistics  between  all  clustered  variables  reported the different  items  of  the  research  instrument (Supplementary_material_appendix_B, Table B14).   The  research  project  was  approved  by  the  ethics  committee  of  the  school  in  the  participating institution  in  the  UK  with  GDPR  (2018)  compliance.  The  ethical  procedure  followed  the  school research  ethics  policy,  addressing  anonymity,  confidentiality,  informed  consent,  the  right  to withdraw, data handling, privacy, and potential risks, for example, reassuring students that the results of  the  survey  would  not  be  linked  to  their  academic  progress  and  that  none  of  the  students would  be  identifiable  via  the questionnaire outcome.   the  statistical  associations  between   Thematic analysis and manual coding (Kiger and Varpio, 2020) was applied to the survey qualitative open data identifying key themes reflected in the questions with subthemes.   The main limitation of the study comprises of a potential narrow perspective of a group of students studying  within  a  single  university  and  country.  Therefore,  the  results  of  the  survey  should  be generalized with caution. However, the approach followed presents a replicable process that can offer a more holistic framework to study the digital competencies development of students in a discipline focused way and design subject related learning interventions in nursing curricula.   Survey results   Self-assessed digital competencies results   {insert Table 1 Demographic characteristics around here}   The  majority  of  the  participants  were  female  (91.3%,  n=505),  undergraduate  students  studying  BSc Nursing  (96,9%,  n=536),  with  almost  an  equal  split  between  those  born  on  or  after  the  year  2000 (Generation  Z)  (51.1%,  n=282)  and  those  before  (49%,  n=271).  The  female  gender  demographic composition of students in this study is not surprising as it reflects a gender imbalance that is evident in the nursing profession overall (RCN, 2018). Most of the students were born in Great Britain (73.6%, n=407)  with  the  next  larger  group  being  Nigerian  students  (8.9%,  n=49).  Approximately  a  third  of students studied in Year 1 (35.8%, n=198), in Year 2 (29.1%, n=161) and in Year 3 (35.1%, n=194) and most had a part-time job while studying at university (Table 1).   Journal of Documentation   Tables B1-B13 (in Supplementary_material_appendix_B) summarize the descriptive statistics in all the survey  digital  competencies  items  using  frequencies  and  median  values.  In  addition,  subgroup  test statistics for all demographic variables are reported through Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H  tests.  The  strongest  area  reported  was  ‘Digital  wellbeing’  with  all  the  items  at  median  4.0 (‘advanced’). This was followed by ‘Everyday life as a digital citizen’, were most of the items were at ‘advanced’  level  (median  4.0),  while  three  items  were  at  ‘intermediate’  level:  ‘e-democracy’,  ‘e- government’  and  ‘e-employment’  (median  3.0)  and  ‘ICT  Proficiency’  were  two  items  were  found  at ‘intermediate’  (median  3.0) level: ‘University  management systems’ and ‘Communication  platforms’ while the rest were all at ‘advanced’ level. ‘Digital communication’ was also a strong area for the group with the majority of items reported at ‘advanced’ (median 4.0) level, while three directions were found to be at intermediate level.   ‘Digital identity management’ was mainly at ‘intermediate’ level with two areas at ‘advanced’ (median 4.0) level: ‘Being aware of the potential positive or negative impact of what you communicate online on your online reputation’ and ‘Understanding the impact of your online interactions’. ‘Information literacy’,  was  found  at  ‘intermediate’  level,  with  only  a  single  item  performing  at  ‘advanced’  level: ‘Popular  information’  (median  4.0).  ‘ICT  productivity’,  ‘Digital  Innovation’  and  Digital  Learning  and Development’  were  found  to  be  at  ‘intermediate’  level  in  all  items.  ‘Digital  creation’  and  ‘Digital research skills’, were both at ‘intermediate’ level throughout, expect for the creation of ‘infographics’ in  the  former  category  and  ‘Using  a  Critical  Appraisal  Tool’  in  the  latter  category,  that  were  both reported at ‘basic’ level (median 2.0). Overall, nursing students assessed themselves at “intermediate” level (median 3.0) in most of the survey constructs and in relation to their digital ability to complete academic work.   Age  demographics  significant  differences  were  identified  in  several  areas  (Supplementary_material _appendix_B), including ‘Digital Learning and Development’ (Table B10), ‘Digital Identity Management’ (Table B11) and ‘Digital Wellbeing’ (Table B12). In addition, significant differences were identified in five items within ‘ICT Proficiency’ (Table B2), three items in ‘Digital Innovation’ (Table B9), seven items in ‘Digital Communication’ skills (Table B8), five items in ‘Digital creation skills’ (Table B6) and three items  in  ‘Everyday  participation  as  digital  citizens”.  There  were  also  other  individual  items,  where significant differences were observed: ‘Sharing securely your digital files with others’ (ICT Productivity) (Table B3), ‘Finding digital information relevant to your academic studies, using databases’ (Information   Literacy) (Table B5) as well as ‘Organising and storing research raw/open data online’ and ‘Using a survey tool’ (Digital Research) (Table B7). It is interesting to note that the direction of the mean rank values of the non-parametric (Man Whitney) test indicated that students who were born in year 2000 or after self-assessed higher overall based on their digital competencies.   In  relation  to  the  overarching  academic  outcomes  question  ‘Which  level  best  describes  your  digital abilities to complete your academic work’ (B13), significant differences were found on the basis of: a) age demographics, b) digital challenges experienced in the area in which students mostly lived (e.g., rural/urban  before  joining  the  university  (e.g.,  access  to  electricity,  computer,  laptop,  mobile  more, tablet, broadband, basic computer training),  c) digital barriers students had experienced in relation to proactively developing their digital skills and d) year of study.   In addition, significant differences were observed between first year and continuing students in the following digital competencies items, where the former group self-assessed higher:  ‘Digital Creation’ (one item: ‘Vlog/Podcasts’)  (Table B6), ‘ICT Proficiency’  (one item: ‘Search engines’) (Table B2),  ‘Digital Innovation’  (one  item:  ‘Working  collaboratively  on  different  aspects  of  a  creative/innovative project/service  design  &  managing  the  process  as  a  team’)  (Table  B9)  and  ‘Digital  learning  and development’ (one item: ‘Using online tools to record learning events/outcomes and use them for self- analysis, reflection, and showcasing of achievement’) (Table B10). Continuing students, on the other hand, only self-assessed higher in two items in ‘Information Literacy’ (‘Scholarly Academic Literature’ and ‘Professional Literature’) (Table B5) and in one item in ‘Everyday participation as digital citizen’ (‘e- democracy’) (Table B1).   Journal of Documentation   Furthermore, the study employed PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the number of digital competencies  variables  in  the  dataset  and  Exploratory  Factor  Analysis  (EFA)  for  the  purposes  of assessing whether they were representative of each of the of each of the underlying construct. PCA transforms  a  set  of  variables  into  a  smaller  set  of  variables,  called  “principal  components”,  which account for most of the variance in the original variables (Comrey and Lee, 1992). PCA with Varimax rotation was employed for grouping the digital competencies constructs. The output of this process is presented in Supplementary_material_appendix_C, Tables C1-C12. The use of KMO and Bartlett Test of  Sphericity  indicated  that  it  was  possible  to  proceed  with  principal  components  factor  analysis (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007).  Each of the survey constructs were grouped into a single component, while the single-item factor loadings were quite high.   The  descriptive  statistics  (mean  and  standard  deviation)  of  the  examined  constructs  for  the  entire sample are presented in the last two rows of Tables C1-C12. As it can be observed that higher digital competencies  were ‘ICT for ‘Digital  Wellbeing’ Proficiency’ (mean = 3.64). Low competencies were reported for ‘Digital Creation’ skills (mean = 2.77) and ‘Digital Research’ skills (mean = 2.87).   reported  ). It is worth noting that strong statistically significant correlations at level p < 0.01(**)  were  identified  between  almost  all  the  self-reported  dimensions  of  digital competencies,  encompassing  digital  skills  that  were  related  to  everyday  life  digital  activities  to  ICT proficiency  and  productivity,  information  literacy,  and  digital  creation,  research  communication, innovation, identity management and wellbeing.   What would empower students to further develop their digital skills   In the survey, students answered an open-ended question which helped to contextualize the above findings. The question centered on ways that would empower them to further develop their digital skills.   Students mentioned several digital skills areas they would need further support with or training on, including learning new software/tools and understanding university systems (e.g., Moodle). Digital skills development  was  centred  on  completing  coursework,  such  as  preparing  online  posters  and presentations (PowerPoint) and formatting information, using referencing tools (such as RefWorks), developing online database searching skills/library searching, data analysis (e.g. Microsoft Excel), digital productivity tools for note-taking and time management. In relation to digital creativity tasks, several skills  mentioned  addressed  blogs,  podcasts  and  creating  videos,  while  in  relation  to  digital communication,  students  referred  to  skills  for  using  social  media  and  for  digital  learning  and development (e.g., e-portfolio).   Respondents also offered ideas for different preferred types of training including workbooks/tutorials, presentations,  bitesize  guides,  video  guides  and  tutorials,  as  well  as  online  training  and  courses,  in- person  sessions  and  one-to-one  support.  Whatever  the  method  proposed,  students  preferred  clear explanations,  “consistent  information\",  and  “accessible  interfaces”,  while  several  respondents mentioned tailored support that is relevant to their careers. In addition, students’ comments indicated that  digital  skills  should  be  taught  early  in  a  course  and    in  collaboration:  “Taught  earlier  and  in collaboration with study skills and the library”, “Teach more in first year to help us build every year we study more sessions when beginning uni to go over how to use the systems”, “Incorporating structured digital skills education and identification of beneficial skills from the beginning of the course”, “Study skills and library support to teach a class at the start of each academic year as a reminder”. In addition, more time dedicated to digital skills development was necessary: “What would empower me would be more  time  to  do  digital  skills”,  “More  time  -  life/study  balance”,  “More  time  to  practice”.  Personal motivation to develop digital skills was equally deemed important. As one student explained: “I decide what I feel is relevant for me to know and the things that I have self-assessed as lower are not important or useful to me”, indicating that a low score on certain digital skills could mean that students were not engaged with the particular skills, or they deemed them necessary or unimportant:   Journal of Documentation   Students required an “interest to learn” which could be triggered by connecting these skills to their course  related  experiences  together  with  reassurance  and  guidance  that  they  were  “in  the  right direction”. As students also explained, digital skills classes could be part of a course: “Incorporate these classes into our timetable” and, in that way, students could be “given time within the module to learn that skill”, especially if “an assignment was in line with a digital literacy skill that I’m lacking”. In addition, teaching staff could use more advanced and interactive tools that would “inspire” them to “develop digital  skills  in  these  areas”  and  “actively  involve”  students  “in  digital  learning  and  collaboration initiatives - e.g., sharing project results online”. Interestingly, beyond embedding digital skills into the study programme, students’ perspectives overall, conveyed a sense of connecting the significance of digital skills to the purposes of academic study rather than to digitally-enabled nursing practice.   “I don't know I don't use certain things or have interest in doing blogs or podcasts etc so that’s why I score low in sections related to that not sure really not interested in using many online tools I like pen and paper”.   “Motivation for using these tools is lacking for me. I’m not sure how this can be supported by academic staff but perhaps if more coursework demanded the use of these digital skills”.   “It’s down to priorities. When content isn’t so engaging or urgent I don’t feel the need to reach out for help so much”.   Students  had  experiences  of  growing  up  in  both  urban  (44.7%,  n=247)  and  rural  (46.5%,  n=257) geographical  areas  (Table  2).  First  level  digital  divides  were  identified  in  17%  (n=97)  of  the  study population, who reported having experienced digital challenges prior to joining the university (such as access to electricity, computer, laptop, mobile more, tablet, broadband, basic computer training), while 77.9% (n=431) reported experiences of at least one second-level barrier to developing their digital skills (e.g., lack of time, training, interest, urgency, confidence, task complexity) (Table 2).   Significant statistical differences were also found in second level digital barriers and self-assessed digital competences, indicating that students who had experienced at least one of the listed barriers in that category (e.g., lack of time, training, interest, confidence) were more likely to self-report lower digital competencies than students who did not encounter any challenges.   Geographical location was not found to directly play a role in the way in which students self-assessed specific digital competencies, although they had an impact on the digital abilities self-assessment of students  for  overall  completing  academic  work.  Significant  statistical  differences  were  identified between  students  who  experienced  at  least  one  of  the  listed  first  level  digital  divides  (e.g.,  lack  of continuous access to electricity, access to a desktop computer, smart mobile phone, tablet broadband, or basic computer training) and self-assessed digital competencies. Students who encountered digital challenges/divides were more likely to self-report lower digital competencies than students who did ‘Everyday  participation  as  digital  citizens’ in not.  The  most  notable  differences  were (Supplementary_material_appendix_B, Table B1), ‘Digital Creation’ (Table B6) and ‘Digital Innovation’ (Table B9), where statistically significant correlations were found across all question items. These were followed  by  ‘ICT  Proficiency’  (Table  B2)  and  ‘Digital  Identity  Management’  (Table  B11),  where  all question items, except for one, were found significant. Additionally, there were three items identified in ‘ICT Productivity’ (Table B3), ‘Digital Research’ (Table B7), and ‘Digital Communication (Table B8), two items in ‘Information Literacy’ (Table B5) and ‘Digital Learning and Development’ (Table B10) and one item in ‘Digital wellbeing’ (Table B12).   Journal of Documentation   Learning disabilities (neurodivergence) were not found to play a role in students’ digital competencies self-assessments  as  no  significant  differences  were  identified  based  on  that  variable,  although transitions are reported as a significant issue for neurodivergent students in previous research (Bakker et  al.  2023).  However,  students  shared  additional  ideas,  which  helped  to  further  contextualize  the findings  in  the  area  of  digital  divides  connected  to  learning  disabilities.  For  example,  different challenges they experienced with ICT proficiency and productivity, such as keeping focused on tasks and avoiding distractions and reading on screen (Supplementary_material_appendix_D, Table D1):   A total of 89 students (16.1%) self-reported a neurodiverse condition, while 82 (14.8%) indicated that they may be neurodivergent, but they are not sure, or they have not been formally diagnosed. The high potential  incidence  of  neurodivergent  students  in  this  study  (total  of  30.9%,  n=171)  is  in  par  with previous studies where a percentage as high as 33% has been reported (HESA 2021) (Table2).   Learning Disability (neurodivergence) Divides   {Insert Table 2 Digital challenges and barriers}   “Struggle to focus on one thing at a time, easily distracted, always need to be doing something else at same time as doing digital tasks”.   Students with Dyspraxia, who typically have difficulty with motor skills in their learning ability to write, type, draw and grasp small objects, also mentioned that the design of the keyboard tools with smaller objects can become an issue for them:   “I find it hard to find the correct keys when typing”.   In  addition,  students  mentioned  challenges  which  could  create  problems  with  feeling  overwhelmed due to information overload that could have a negative impact on processing information from multiple online sources or complex tools which could be a barrier to information literacy and digital research skills development:   “Being presented with large amounts of information at once makes it difficult to comprehend instructions or maintain focus without feeling overwhelmed”.   Besides the use of videos, students with autism specifically, highlighted the use of time-management memory-improving tools to address a need for structured learning actions:   Several students also shared different methods and strategies for overcoming these challenges, with the most popular being using assistive technologies (which were popular with dyslexic students) and audio-visual strategies (Supplementary_material_appendix_D, Table D2):   Students  required  more  support  in  navigating  different  technologies  and  assistive  tools  available  to them  and  they  preferred  solutions  considering  the  unique  challenges  of  their  specific  conditions, especially dyslexia:   “Try to use systems available but would be interested to see more specific for dyslexia”.   “Good routine helps me, so things like a calendar and well-organised meetings”.   “I have found apps such as Read & Write Gold extremely helpful. Grammarly has also helped”.   Journal of Documentation   “There are none that I have found or know about”.   “An app that converts my handwriting into text. Also, dragon that turns speech into text”.   Several students with ADHD mentioned challenges related to lack of attention to detail and continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones, also reporting that they were unaware of tools available to them, highlighting a need for the development of a toolkit considering apps, programmes and digital tools to support them:   Students with dyscalculia mentioned the need for “Numeracy tools would be helpful to enhance my numeracy skills”, referring to “Websites calculators and British National Formulary (BNF) app” and to the of “dyscalculia-friendly fonts and coloured backgrounds to help the numbers stand out”.   Students with dyspraxia revealed the use of multiple tools to overcome challenges around a set of skills known as transcription and writing. Again, students used Grammarly, Dragon, Read and Write Gold and Dragon:   However, some students mentioned using various assistive technology tools to manage their workload such as “Speechify app”, “Google Calendar for planning”. As another student explained:   However, students also highlighted that some students can have multiple disabilities.   “I need to make sure I am very organised, and I write everything down. Lately, I put tasks I don't want to forget in my calendar on my iPad because that gives me the best overview of everything. I colour- code everything as well, which is very helpful”.   Students mentioned the effective role of the university’s support services in supplying these assistive learning technology tools: “I have many tools on my laptop provided by the learning team now” and “The  university  has  supplied  me  with  a  laptop  with  various  apps  on  to  help  with  this”.    They  also mentioned  several  approaches  that  bring  structure  into  their  learning  process,  such  as  listening  to music,  taking  small  “breaks  little  and  often”,  and  advised  that  making  “lectures  more  interactive  or   prerecorded  so  we  can  pause  and  take  breaks  when  necessary  to  stay  focused”  and  “Videos  and visualisation” are beneficial for their comprehension.   This need for upskilling was also prevalent in this study in which nursing students self-assessed their digital competencies at intermediate level in most digital skills areas. This research also offered a better understanding of how students may transfer into HE existing digital divides from everyday life in a way that may have an impact on their follow up digital literacy development; these highlight the need for further  learning  opportunities  to  develop  digital  skills  that  meet  the  expectations  of  the  nursing profession,  particularly  with  the  emergence  of  new  innovative  technologies  and  AI  related transformations that require advanced digital skills (Rony, Parvin and Ferdousi, 2024).   This study sought to explore how nursing students self-assess based on their digital competencies and to further understand any existing obstacles to digital literacy development they encountered. Digital exclusion in Higher Education has been examined in previous research, however, most frequently, at the level of technological infrastructure and internet connectivity and in relation global geographical divisions created between the Global North and the Global South countries (Thomas-Slayter, 2003), where  people  are  more  likely  to  experience  poverty  and  limited  access  to  resources  or  educational opportunities (ACU, 2020, Lembani et. al., 2020). At EU level, it has been reported that digital divides based on accessibility have been reduced over the last years, however, there is still a fundamental need for upskilling, with one of the four key goals of the European Commission (2021) focusing on “a digitally skilled population and highly-skilled digital professionals”.   Journal of Documentation   Significant differences were also observed in relation to age demographics, with younger students self- assessing  their  digital  competencies  at  a  higher  level  overall.  In  addition,  first  year  students  self- assessed higher than continuing students in certain digital skills areas, which required digital creation, ICT proficiency and innovation skills, while continuing students were stronger in information literacy, which  presents  a  fundamental  academic  skill,  especially  in  nursing  education  and  practice,  where evidence-based practice is a core direction in clinical decision making and for the delivery of quality healthcare  (Majid  et  al.,  2011).  On  the  other  hand,  research  skills  did  not  appear  to  be  an  area  of strength of students, possibly because most of the students were UG and in their first year of study. This signifies a need to develop more robust strategies for supporting students at early levels to excel in  digital  research  foundational  skills.  Further  research  replicating  this  methodology  could  further explore this outcome with diverse students at different study levels.   This  research  also  offered  a  deeper  contextual  understanding  of  the  diverse  range  of  digital  skills challenges  and  the  variability  of  strategies  followed  by  neurodivergent  students  which  signifies  the need for a universal design to nursing education to accommodate diverse needs and requirements of all learners (Halligan et al., 2019). In this study students’ existing neurodiverse conditions did not appear to  play  a  role  in  the  way  in  which  they  self-assessed  their  digital  competencies.  This  adds  some additional  evidence  to  the  position  that  people  with  neurodiverse  conditions  do  not  necessarily encounter challenges in their development of digital skills more broadly and may instead be presented with unique opportunities in digital tech employment environments that require digital innovation and creativity  (Autism  Network  Scotland,  n.d.).  Despite  this  result,  neurodivergent  students  described different  barriers  they  experienced  particularly  within  the  areas  of  ‘ICT  proficiency’  and  ‘ICT productivity’,  where  they  recommended  available  tools  and  strategies  that  can  assist  in  keeping focused on tasks and avoiding distractions. These suggestions can assist in developing more tailored and informed digital skills support. They also offered personal strategies for overcoming these barriers, which provide helpful insights and directions for digital skills programme development. It is important to  cater  for  these  challenges  in  a  way  that  is  different  according  to  the  individual  neurodivergent conditions of students.   Overall, the strong statistical correlations between the self-reported digital competencies dimensions in  this  study,  offered  empirical  evidence  of  the  interplay  between  everyday  life,  learning  and  work- related digital competencies, putting forward the need for a more holistic approach to the teaching of digital skills in nursing education. Previous research with nursing students has mainly placed emphasis on  individual  digital  skills,  such  as  “digital  professionalism”  (Mather  et  al,  2018),  electronic  health literacy (Anderberg et al. 2019, p. 5), or information literacy (Aylward et al. (2020), centred on “the reliability and validity of online health care information” (Blakemore et al., 2020). Other research has explored the socio-emotional factors on students’ digital literacy, such their awareness of digital issues in the online environment (Erdat, 2023; Okumus and Atılgan, 2021; Park, 2013).   The  above  findings  offer  important  directions  for  the  nature  of  support  that  academic  libraries  can provide  for  nursing  students’  development  of  digital  competencies.  The  most important recommendation  addresses  the  need  to  design  tailored  digital  literacy  programmes  which  focus  on specific digital skills, such as digital creation and digital research and in a way that carers for the needs of different students (e.g., first year and continuing students).  Digital literacy programs should not only be offered at an appropriate knowledge level, but also support nursing students to develop awareness of state-of-the art knowledge of digital tools and methodologies for healthcare, such as evidence-based practice,  predictive  analytics  and  artificial  intelligence  for  patient  care  and  clinical  decision-making (Agnew, 2022). Finally, more emphasis is necessary in promoting the importance of continuous learning and  upskilling  in  digital  competencies  and  the  relevance  of  advanced  digital  skills  in  the  context  of emerging  technologies  and  transformations  in  healthcare.  Current  research  points  to  evidence  that library  support  has  a  positive  impact  on  nursing  students’  information  literacy  skill  development (Purnell, Royal and Warton (2020). However, information literacy skills development takes place within the  context  of  developing  a  range  of  digital  skills  that  involve  other  interrelated  skills,  such  as  ICT proficiency, digital communication and digital learning and development, among others. Approaching the development of digital skills holistically means working synergistically with students and adopting a  learner-centered  approach  that  identifies  and  addresses  existing  gaps  in  information  and  digital literacy.  This  approach  necessitates  nurturing  a  lifelong  learning  mindset  in  students  to  ensure continuous skills development.   Journal of Documentation   There is not a one-fits-all approach to digital competencies development, as not one student is similar because of their individual characteristics and life experiences. However, developing a more informed understanding  of  students’  digital  competencies  gaps  and  the  multiple  shapes  that  digital  exclusion may take is important for the design of meaningful digital skills enhancement programmes in Higher Education.  As this study showed, digital competencies were not only multidimensional, complex and interrelated, but also influenced by diverse digital challenges and barriers. The results of this study put forward  the  importance  of  libraries  collaborating  with  schools  for  offering  a  discipline-based  and tailored scaffolding approach to the development of nursing students’ digital competencies, as opposed to a ‘one fits-all’, generic or baseline direction. Higher Education should focus on equipping students with discipline related digital skills and knowledge in a way that relates to students’ future professional trajectories and ensure a “digitally fluent workforce” (Lokmic-Tomkins, et al., 2021), not only a digitally fluent student. It should also develop increased awareness of the digital barriers and experiences that students encounter within their everyday lives. This involves a continuous engagement with evolving digital skills needs in the profession and a focus on students’ learning and development for life. Future research  should  explore  the  parameters  of  interrelated  digital  skills  withing  everyday  life  and  work environments and examine how experiences within different settings influence strategies for students’ ongoing learning and professional growth.   Finally,  it  is  important  to  note  that,  although  this  study  explored  nursing  students,  its  design  and findings  are  relevant  and  applicable  to  digital  divides  that  may  be  present  in  other  student populations. Digital  competencies  is  a  critical  skillset  for  students  across  different  disciplines  and not  unique  to nursing,  and,  as  changing  digital  technologies  become  integral  to  different  aspects of  learning  and  diverse  professional  practice,  it  is  important    to  develop  tailored  digital  literacy support, informed by detailed  understanding  of  students’  development  needs,  in  a  way  that  relates meaningfully to their study directions, their future professional trajectories and their individual   knowledge levels and skills.  The research methodology applied in this study has already been tested with  other  student  populations  with  the  aim  to  explore  pockets  of  digital  inequalities  across different  discipline  areas,  such  as  Law  (Martzoukou  et  al.,  2022)  and  Information  Science (Martzoukou et al. 2020), with the input of academic staff/students  and  with  the  aim  to  offer  digital literacy  training  and  support  and  enhance  students’  digital  capacity  as  future  professionals.  In addition,  the  study’s  novel  insights  into  the  digital  challenges  that  neurodivergent  students encounter  demonstrates  the  necessity  for inclusive  educational  strategies,  in  a  way  that  can be  applied  to  other  fields  beyond  nursing,  to  ensure  that  all  students, regardless of their learning needs, have equal opportunities to develop essential digital competencies.

         "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a significant threat to women's health as a malignant breast tumour. The limited efficacy of chemotherapy has spurred the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Natural products serve as the foundation for drug discovery, with structural alterations playing a crucial role in the process of pharmaceutical exploration. This study introduced a new chrysin derivative, HYS-072, which includes a urea group and demonstrates micromolar equipotent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50 = 3.3 μM). In vitro investigations have shown that HYS-072 triggers apoptosis and autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway. In the xenograft model conducted in vivo, HYS-072 demonstrated efficacy in suppressing cancer growth through the modulation of autophagy-related signalling pathways. Collectively, HYS-072 shows promise as a potential therapeutic agent for TNBC. This research underscores the potential of utilising natural product-based autophagy induction as a strategy for TNBC treatment.",

         " A Novel Chrysin Derivative HYS-072 Induces Apoptosis and   Autophagy in Triple-negative Breast Cancer Cells   aCollege of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key   Teng Peng, College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key   Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a significant threat to women's health as   a malignant breast tumor. The limited efficacy of chemotherapy has spurred the   exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Natural products serve as the   foundation for drug discovery, with structural alterations playing a crucial role in the   process of pharmaceutical exploration. This study introduced a new chrysin derivative,   HYS-072, which includes a urea group and demonstrates micromolar equipotent   inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50 = 3.3 μM). In vitro investigations have shown   that HYS-072 triggers apoptosis and autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells by modulating   the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In the xenograft model conducted in vivo,   HYS-072 demonstrated efficacy in suppressing cancer growth through the modulation   of autophagy-related signaling pathways. Collectively, HYS-072 shows promise as a   potential therapeutic agent for TNBC. This research underscores the potential of   utilizing natural product-based autophagy induction as a strategy for TNBC treatment.

Investigation of the in vitro inhibitory efficacy of chrysin derivatives   incorporating a urea moiety against TNBC cell lines.   a The results represent the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent   experiments conducted in triplicate.   The reagents and solvents employed in this research were procured from   commercial sources and utilized without further purification. Silica gel (100-200   mesh) served as the medium for column chromatography in the purification procedure.   The progress of reactions was monitored using a fluorescent marker, and the   visualization of spots on silica gel plates was facilitated by UV light at wavelengths of   Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained utilizing a Bruker   AV-600 spectrometer operating at frequencies of 1H, 400 MHz, and 13C, 101 MHz,   with tetramethylsilane (TMS) serving as the internal reference standard. The NMR   spectra employed abbreviations to represent spin multiplicities, including singlet (s),   doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m), and doublet of doublets (dd). The   coupling constants (J) were denoted in hertz (Hz), while the chemical shifts were   presented in parts per million (ppm, δ) with respect to TMS.   Compounds 1-10 were synthesized following the general procedure delineated in   Scheme 1. The synthesis commenced with a substitution reaction involving chrysin   dissolved in acetone, catalyzed by the presence of K2CO3, KI, and tert-butyl   carbamate derivatives of bromoalkylamine,   leading to the formation of   corresponding intermediate. The resultant residue was subsequently purified using   silica gel chromatography with a solvent system of CH2Cl2/CH3OH in a ratio of 50:1.   Subsequently, the intermediate was dissolved in 5 mL of dichloromethane, to which   2.5 mL of trifluoroacetic acid was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at room   temperature for a duration of six hours to facilitate the removal of the tert-butyl   formate protecting group. Finally, A mixture of chrysin alkylamine derivatives, ethyl   isocyanate derivatives, and triethylamine was subjected to reflux stirring in   acetonitrile for an extended period overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated   under reduced pressure, and the resultant residue was purified using silica gel   chromatography with a solvent system of dichloromethane and methanol in a ratio of   Scheme 1. Synthesis pathways for chrysin derivatives incorporating urea functional groups.   Regents and conditions: (a) K2CO3, KI, acetone, tert-butyl carbamate derivatives, 65℃; (b)   DCM, CF3COOH, r.t.; (c) CH3CN, isocyanate derivatives, Et3N, 80℃ , reflux   The purity of HYS-072 was confirmed through analysis utilizing an analytical   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)   instrument manufactured by   located in Santa Clara, CA, USA. This study utilized a GL-C18   reverse-phase column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 μM) in conjunction with pure water   and high-grade methanol as the mobile phase for chromatographic analysis.   Step 1: Combine 2 mmol of chrysin, 4 mmol of tert-butyl N-(4-bromobutyl)carbamate,   6 mmol of potassium carbonate, and 0.2 mmol of potassium iodide in 50 mL of   acetone, and proceed to stir and reflux the mixture at 60℃ for a duration of 12 hours.   Following the completion of the reaction, the mixture should be cooled to room   temperature, filtered, and subsequently concentrated. The resulting yellow solid   intermediate can then be purified through silica gel column chromatography.   Step 2: The intermediate product from the preceding stage was dissolved in 10 mL of   dichloromethane, followed by the gradual addition of 5 mL of trifluoroacetic acid   with stirring at ambient   temperature for a duration of 6 hours. Following the   completion of the reaction, a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate in water was   introduced to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with dichloromethane (3   × 30 mL). The resulting organic phases were combined, dehydrated using anhydrous   sodium sulfate, concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a pale yellow solid,   which did not necessitate additional purification.   Step 3: The intermediate, obtained in the preceding step at a quantity of 0.5 mmol,   was dissolved in 20 mL of acetonitrile along with p-tolyl isocyanate (1.5 mmol) and   subjected to reflux at 85℃ for a duration of 12 hours. Following the completion of the   reaction,   the resulting mixture was concentrated under   reduced pressure and   subsequently purified through silica gel column chromatography utilizing a eluent   system consisting of dichloromethane and methanol in a ratio of 25:1.

Following   digestion with pancreatic enzymes, HCC1937, MDA-MB-436, and MDA-MB-231   were processed into cell suspensions and subsequently seeded at a density of 8500   cells per well in 96-well plates for experimentation utilizing a cell counting plate   method. Following a 24-hour incubation period at 37°C, the cells were exposed to   compounds of differing concentrations for 48 hours. The subsequent evaluation of the   antitumor proliferation activity of both the compounds and positive controls was   conducted in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the CCK8 assay kit.   2.4 Colony formation assay   In order to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the compounds on cell proliferation, a   total of 1000 cells were plated in a 6-well plate and subsequently incubated at 37°C   for a period of 24 hours. Following this,   the cells were exposed to varying   concentrations of the compound for a duration of 10 days, after which the supernatant   was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were   treated with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for a duration   of 25 minutes. The clonal formation rate was then determined by quantifying the   number of clones containing more than 10 cells through microscopic observation.   prepared as a cell suspension and seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 6-well   plates. After a 24-hour incubation at 37°C, the cells were vertically scratched using a   pipette tip in the original culture medium. The cells were then washed with PBS to   eliminate the scratched cells and supplemented with low-serum culture medium.   Subsequently, image data was captured using a microscope for further analysis. The   cells were subsequently exposed to compounds of varying concentrations for 48 hours,   followed by a wash with PBS and incubation in serum-free culture medium. Finally,   image data was captured using a microscope.   2.6 Flow cytometry assay   In accordance with the protocols specified in the assay kits, candidate molecules   were evaluated for their effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis using cell   cycle and apoptosis assay kits from Biyuntian Biotechnology Co., Ltd., as well as the   BD Pharmingen™ FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit from BD Biosciences,   San Diego, CA. Subsequently, flow cytometry (BD FACS Calibur) was employed to   assess cell cycle distribution and apoptosis.

Each mouse received a subcutaneous   injection of   MDA-MB-231 cells at a concentration of 2.0×106 cells per mouse. When the tumor   volume reached 100-200 mm3 (calculated using the formula V=L×W2/2), the nude   mice were randomly assigned to one of five groups: a control group, a group   receiving treatment with chrysin (40 mg/(kg·d) suspended in a solution of 5%(v/v)   dimethyl sulfoxide, 35%(w/v) 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, and 60% saline), and   two groups receiving treatment with the candidate molecule at doses of 20, 40, or 80   mg/(kg·d) suspended in a solution of 5%(v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 10%(w/v)   sulfobutyl-β-cyclodextrin, and 85% saline. Following this,   the chrysin treatment   group and the candidate molecule treatment group were orally administered   predetermined concentrations of chrysin or candidate molecules via gavage on a daily   basis for a duration of 21 consecutive days. The tumor size and body weight of the   nude mice were regularly monitored and measured every three days. Following the   completion of the final treatment, the nude mice were euthanized in accordance with   animal ethics protocols, and their tumors were collected for subsequent analysis.   2.9 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis   tissue   sections   individually   immersed   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) antigen retrieval buffer (pH 8.0) or citrate   buffer (pH 6.0) and exposed to microwave irradiation. Following this, the sections   were exposed to the appropriate antibody at a concentration of 1:500 at 37°C for 30   antibody before undergoing contrast staining with hematoxylin.   2.10 Immunofluorescence analysis   Cells were cultured on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate and stimulated for 5   days. They were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% Triton   X-100. Following PBS washing, the cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with   specific primary antibodies. After a single wash with cold PBS,   they were   co-incubated at 25°C with relevant secondary antibodies for 60 minutes. Subsequently,   the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI for 10 minutes before capturing images using a   confocal microscope.   2.11 Statistical analysis   The data results were obtained through triplicate measurements and are reported   as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Subsequently, the data underwent analysis   using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. Statistical significance was determined through   one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or t-tests, with a significance level of P<0.05.",

Stroke survivors may develop a condition known as learned non-use, resulting in a\ntendency to avoid using the affected hand due to failure. Previous research has shown that constraint-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ninduced movement therapy (CIMT), where the healthy arm is physically constrained to encourage the use\nof the stroke-affected arm, is effective in UL rehabilitation. However, some patients \u0000nd it exhausting and\ntiring. New technologies have been applied to stroke rehabilitation alongside conventional techniques in\nrecent years. For example, immersive virtual reality (IVR) has emerged as a new treatment approach for\nstroke rehabilitation, simulating real-life activities to work on self-care skills. Method: in this pilot study,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nwe evaluated the e\u0000cacy of the IVR, which incorporates positive reinforcement components in motor\ncoordination as opposed to CIMT using IVR technology. Eighteen participants were randomized to an IVR\ngroup to receive VR intervention plus physical therapy (PT) sessions or a control group to receive PT\nsessions alone. Participants were instructed to reach with either their affected or unaffected hand to a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nrandomly assigned target in the VR. The movement of the virtual image of the UL was reinforced by\nvisual feedback to the participants. Treatment effects on motor recovery were investigated using the\nFugl-Meyer (FM) scale for the UL, kinematic dataset, and a questionnaire.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nthe IVR group exhibited signi\u0000cant improvements in FM scores (p < 0.05) between the \u0000rst and \u0000fth\nsession, signifying a substantial recovery of UL motor function, with the \u0000fth session showing higher\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nscores. The time to target in the last session reduced compared with that in the \u0000rst session, suggesting\nmotor learning and recovery (p < 0.05). The patients were highly engaged and motivated during the\nsessions because they felt like they were in charge of the virtual image of their upper body.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe results suggest that positive reinforcement within the IVR could encourage motor recovery of the\naffected hand and may facilitate the application of motor learning and neuroplasticity principles during\nneurological rehabilitation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.0**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nA stroke occurs when blood \u0000ow to the brain is interrupted or is insu\u0000cient, leading to brain injury or cell\ndeath and subsequent impairment of physical and mental functions [1–3]. This may cause sensory,\nmotor, and cognitive impairments as well as impaired self-care ability and participation in social and\ncommunal activities [4, 5]. The number of stroke deaths in England decreased by half during the \u0000rst\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\ndecade of the 21st century [6], and in 2018 it ranked as the fourth leading cause of mortality [7].\nNonetheless, a signi\u0000cant proportion of stroke survivors continue to live with disabilities. Motor\nimpairment is the most common complication after a stroke, and it can negatively affect health and\nmotor skills, particularly when it affects the upper limbs [8, 9].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nAccording to Adamovich et al. [10], stroke patients undergoing treatment for upper limb impairment\nencounter various challenges. The functional outcome is highly variable; some patients are unable to\nfully recover functionality and are forced to live with varying degrees of upper limb paresis for the rest of\ntheir lives. It has also been reported that the treatment of upper limb hemiparesis is time-sensitive and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ninvolves various therapeutic modalities [11, 12]. Thus, these scienti\u0000c studies emphasize the need for\nappropriate rehabilitation procedures that can provide highly effective therapy and a greater possibility of\na higher-level functional recovery. Successful rehabilitation depends on the stroke’s characteristics (such\nas severity, nature, and location) as well as the patient’s age, general health, and pre-stroke function [13].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nOtherwise, the stroke patient whose impaired hand is rendered inactive for an extended period may\nacquire learned non-use. Learned non-use is the outcome of repeated unsuccessful attempts to use the\naffected upper limb coupled with the reinforcement of compensatory methods (such as the use of the\nunaffected upper limb), which leads to deterrence in using the affected arm [14–17]. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to consider the optimal rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients with upper limb disability and\nlimitations.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nAccording to the International Classi\u0000cation of Functioning, Disability, and Health, physiotherapists are\nan essential component of multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation teams [18, 19], as they assist patients in\nregaining mobility and independence by addressing impairments in bodily functions, activity limitations,\nand participation restrictions [20]. To recover movement, coordination, and balance, a physiotherapist\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nprovides conventional physical therapy (PT) for upper limb rehabilitation through exercises, training, and\nphysical movement of the limbs [21].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nIt has been established that repetitive task training is bene\u0000cial in certain aspects of rehabilitation, such\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nas improving upper limb function [22, 23]. Hence, the term “sensory motor training” was established to\nrepresent various physical activities designed to improve motor performance, strength, power,\nendurance, and sensory integrity, such as proprioception. Moreover, the neuroscience and rehabilitation\nliterature are supporting the idea that task-speci\u0000c or task-oriented practice is essential for restoring\nfunctionality in stroke-impaired limbs. This implies that repeatedly practicing a di\u0000cult activity can alter\nbrain networks responsible for motor control, leading to long-term improvements in motor learning and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nMotor coordination can only be regained through a neuroplasticity process [25], which is described as\nthe rewiring of the brain’s synaptic connections to develop appropriate communication with the body’s\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe most crucial component is performing repeated movements, which provides patients with the ability\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nto perform an activity normally [27]. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been reported to\nbe effective in treating severe paralysis in the body by training the nerve impulses of damaged muscles\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nthrough constant repetition of movement on the affected side [23, 28, 29]. However, CIMT has major\ndisadvantages, such as exhausting the patient owing to its intensity [30, 31]. Consequently, recent\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\ntechnological solutions have shown promise in terms of improving the function of impaired limbs\nwithout exhausting patients.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nVirtual reality (VR) has emerged as a new treatment approach for stroke rehabilitation, simulating real-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nlife activities to improve self-care skills [32, 33]. In virtual rehabilitation, patients receive visual feedback\nfrom simulated environments and objects through a head-mounted device, projection system, or \u0000at\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nscreen, while all body senses offer feedback [34]. Virtual tasks and environments affect the users’\nsenses, and they perceive their presence in the virtual world [35, 36]. By adjusting stimuli to movements\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nin real time and incorporating and modifying feedback, VR may enhance the application of motor\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nlearning and neuroplasticity principles during rehabilitation [35] as it provides components (such as goal-\noriented tasks and repetition) demonstrated to be vital in rehabilitation [10].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nAlthough there is limited evidence of neuroplasticity during VR training, neuroimaging discoveries are\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nguiding the development of VR to meet the highest treatment standards [37]. As technology becomes a\nbroader component of daily life, it is anticipated that the use of VR in rehabilitation settings will increase\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n[38, 39]. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of VR in order to de\u0000ne its future designs and\nimplementations. The VR environment motivates patients to perform repetitive, motor-intensive tasks\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nthat are crucial for rehabilitation [40–44]. Compared with conventional rehabilitation techniques, a\nconcise adaptive game can improve mobility, motor function, and mental wellbeing.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nNeurological patients generally lack therapy motivation [44]. Possible explanations for this lack of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nmotivation include patients’ belief that therapy only intends to enable adaptation to the disease rather\nthan providing complete healing, or a lack of motivating input from a therapist [44, 45]. Other logistic,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n\u0000nancial, environmental, and human obstacles may restrict the e\u0000cacy and commitment to long-term\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nrehabilitation regimens [42] found that combining VR with modi\u0000ed CIMT encouraged stroke patients to\nuse the affected hand without constraining the unaffected side (both hands were free to move). Another\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.3**\nstudy investigated the safety and effectiveness of VR and modi\u0000ed CIMT [46].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nRelevant to our investigation, [47] proposed a new treatment that combines CIMT and reinforcement-\ninduced movement therapy (RIMT). They demonstrated the e\u0000cacy of RIMT by speeding up the hindered\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nhand in VR using the goal-oriented reaching task. After the RIMT intervention, the Fugl-Meyer (FM)\nscores of stroke patients improved; however, their study did not report the subjective feeling of being\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ncompletely engaged in VR. Although they pioneered positive reinforcement utilizing computer-simulated\nlimbs in the display, the RIMT concept should be developed to use immersive VR (IVR).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nVisual feedback in IVR simply displays the simulated upper limb. Only the simulated hand should be seen\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.0**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nduring the task. If people watch their real hand move in front of them while viewing the simulated hand\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\non the display, the discrepancy in visual feedback of motor coordination will induce a sense of loss of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nownership of the simulated upper limb or, in certain situations, the subjective awareness of the loss of\nbodily control.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nOur study by [48] that used IVR on healthy subjects with a weight attached to their dominant hand to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nsimulate the impairment of a stroke patient is also relevant to our investigation. Their system was\nportable (head-mounted VR), and the objective was to reach a target in VR without forcing the subjects\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nto use their dominant hand, with an option to use either hand. The movement of the virtual image of the\nupper limb was reinforced by visual feedback to the participants, such that they perceived their motor\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ncoordination as if their upper limb was moving to a greater extent than normal. These \u0000ndings suggest\nthat positive reinforcement within IVR can in\u0000uence hand usage decision-making.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nThus, herein, we modi\u0000ed the protocol developed by [48] for stroke survivors to accommodate the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nspeci\u0000c requirements of the patients, including extended task completion time and breaks to prevent\nfatigue, as detailed in the method section.

An integrated IVR system consists of a VR headset (Oculus Rift) and a small motion\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ncapture sensor (Leap Motion) attached to the headset (Fig. 1) Both products are CE marked. This system\ncan monitor the actual upper limb movements of the participants and create a virtual image of the\ncorresponding upper limb in the IVR environment. It also provides a real time motion of the\ncorresponding virtual upper limb. The person using IVR equipment can “look around” the arti\u0000cial world\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nand interact with virtual features or objects. Through iterative visual-motor loops in the brain, the person\nexperiences a feeling of controlling the virtual image of their body in such a way that the virtual world\ncan be perceived as a real one. Stroke survivors go through task-oriented training of the upper limb in the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nIVR environment. As they experience the ideal motor coordination of their upper limb’s avatar, successful\nmatching of motor intention and resultant motor coordination in the IVR allows brain networks to form\nnew neuronal pathways for spontaneous motion in their daily life. Therefore, IVR-enhanced therapy may\noffer a powerful rehabilitation approach, allowing PT to be tailored to the speci\u0000c needs of survivors with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nParticipants were asked to sit comfortably on a chair and place their upper extremities on a table in front\nof them (Fig. 1A). Seven targets were arranged in a semi-circular orientation within the IVR environment\n(Fig. 2A). As a goal-oriented task, participants were asked to reach for the target immediately by\nchoosing their healthy or impaired upper limb hand (Fig. 2B). To implement reinforcement-induced PT,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthe velocity of the hand of the impaired upper limb was ampli\u0000ed in the virtual environment in the\ndirection of the target. The target turned blue when reached by the virtual hand and immediately\ndisappeared. Unlike for healthy individuals, we increased the time to 4 seconds after the ball appeared to\nprevent in-depth consideration regarding choosing, as stroke patients require more time. If this condition\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.3**\nwas not ful\u0000lled, the target disappeared, and the trial was invalidated.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe experiment included three stages: familiarization, intervention, and washout (Fig. 3). At each stage,\nvisual ampli\u0000cation is consistently applied to the affected side (right or left), in contrast to the healthy\nexperiment where the visual ampli\u0000cation depended on the experimental phase, speci\u0000cally for the right\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nside. The visual ampli\u0000cation, de\u0000ned as increasing the velocity of the virtual hand corresponding to the\nimpaired upper limb by 1.4 times compared to the actual hand motion, will be described. It was\nhypothesized that the participants would start to use the affected hand more often as the velocity was\nampli\u0000ed in the IVR environment.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe aim of the familiarization stage was to acquaint the participants with the task. In this stage, \u0000ve\ntargets (excluding the far right and far left targets) appeared randomly in a semi-circular array in the\nvirtual environment (see Fig. 2A), each target appeared four times. For example, participants completed\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n20 reaching trials, equally divided between using the right hand (the \u0000ve targets appearing twice) and the\nleft hand in 10 trials each (the \u0000ve targets appearing twice). This stage was applied only once at the\nbeginning of each session.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nSubsequently, the primary stage in this experiment was the intervention stage/free choice stage, wherein\nthe participants were free to choose the right or left hand (unaffected or affected limb) to reach the\ntarget that randomly appeared in seven different positions. To accommodate the patients in the study,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nwe reduced the number of times they reached for the ball from 70 to 35 (5 times per target), This\nadjustment was implemented due to our concern about potential participant fatigue. Post-stroke fatigue,\nwhich is prevalent throughout the acute and chronic phases following a stroke and can substantially\nimpact rehabilitation outcomes, should also be considered when designing a treatment plan [50]. Due to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nbrain damage and limb weakening, stroke survivors are more likely to experience fatigue than healthy\nindividuals. In this stage, the participants repeated the reaching task at their own pace, with varying\nrepetitions per person in each session. Each task comprised 35 balls and lasted for 3–5 minutes. To\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\navoid fatigue, participants were given 2-minute rest periods between each task. The term \"session\" refers\nto the time when patients receive IVR training, occurring once per day. The number of sessions is\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ndetermined by the duration of the patient's hospital stay until discharge or completion of 15 sessions—\nwhichever comes sooner.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nThe \u0000nal stage was the washout, similar to the intervention stage (35 target per task) but gradual\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nreduction in the velocity of ampli\u0000cation in the IVR environment to 1.2 times the actual hand motion. We\nhypothesized that even when the ampli\u0000cation is reduced in the IVR environment, the participants would\ncontinue to utilize the affected upper limb, resulting in increased use of the affected upper limb in daily\nlife. This stage was intended to commence from the 10th session and extend until the 15th session.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nHowever, because of early discharge of patients, we could complete this stage with only two patients.\nThe entire session lasted for 20–40 minutes, depending on the patient’s condition.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe Fugl Meyer for upper limb (FM) assessment was used to evaluate the functional motor condition as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthe primary outcome in this study. FM score was selected as the primary outcome measure because FM\nassessment is a well-designed, feasible, and effective clinical examination technique that has been\nextensively used in the stroke population [51–54]. This scale is highly recommended as a clinical and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nresearch instrument for assessing changes in motor impairment after stroke [55]. The evaluation was\nconducted by a physiotherapist who participated in the program. The FM assessment is crucial for\ndetermining motor recovery and disease severity [56]. It has \u0000ve domains: motor function, sensory\nfunction, balance, joint range of motion, and joint pain [57, 58]. The motor function domain is the most\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nwidely used and plays a primary role in monitoring motor recovery after stroke. The items in the FM\nmotor function domain are based on patient motion, coordination, and re\u0000ex action in the shoulder,\nelbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. Each domain contains multiple items, each scored on a 3-point ordinal\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nscale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially, 2 = performs fully). The total score varies from 0 to 66.\nThe measurements were utilized to assess the e\u0000cacy of IVR feedback in restoring motor coordination\naffecting the patient’s QoL. Our initial plan was to collect FM scores from participants at the beginning,\nmiddle, and end of their participation in the study. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nlength of hospitalization varied, and patients could be discharged without notice. Hence, depending on\nthe length of stay, we evaluated the patients in the \u0000rst, \u0000fth, and tenth sessions. The control group\nunderwent evaluations during corresponding sessions, ensuring consistent assessment across both\ngroups with the same timescales as the intervention group. Note that the ethical approval allowed a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\ncertain period for our clinical study, not allowing us to extend our study to recruit more patients.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nWe used a questionnaire administered at the end of the last session to evaluate patient experience,\nprovide information regarding the sense of agency (subjective awareness of initiating and controlling\none’s own activities) [59], and obtain comments about the training sessions in the IVR environment. The\nquestionnaire contained four short items that required participants to respond with a simple “yes,” “no,”\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.5**\n• Did you feel that you were controlling the virtual hand?\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.3**\n• Did you feel a sense of achievement during the virtual reality therapy?\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.4**\n• Did you feel dizzy when looking around in the virtual reality?\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.4**\n• Did you feel any fatigue in any of your muscles during the therapy?\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.2**\n• If you have any comments or feedback on your experience, please include them below.\nB. Barthel Index (Clinical Outcome)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe Barthel index (BI; modi\u0000ed 10-item version) is used to measure the amount of independence and\nmobility of patients in their activities of daily living (ADL), such as feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nbowel control, bladder control, toileting, chair transfer, ambulation, and stair climbing [60]. The evaluation\nwas conducted by a physiotherapist who was not involved in the training. This tool indicates the need for\nassistance in care and is widely used as a measure of functional disability [61]. Depending on the item,\nfunctional categories may be rated 0–1, 0–2, or 0–3 points. The range of possible total scores is 0–20.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.3**\nTwo measurements were taken at both the baseline and discharge stages.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nTo evaluate the use of unaffected and affected hands in the VR environment during the training sessions\nbased on enhanced visual feedback, we calculated the border angle (BA) of the \u0000rst two repetitions of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthe task (total of 70 times) in each patient across the sessions. A psychometric function was \u0000tted to\nthe plots of the probability of affected hand usage as a function of the target angles; (see Fig. 2B in [48]).\nThe angle at which the psychometric function corresponds to a 50% probability was de\u0000ned as the BA.\nII. Time to Target\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nTo determine the time to target for each subject, the reaction time of the affected hand for each target\nwas recorded, encompassing the duration from the ball's onset to the participant reaching it. Each trial\ncommenced with participants placing their hands at the starting point (home position), triggering the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nappearance of the ball upon accurate hand placement. Following this, participants reached the target,\nreturned their hands to the starting position, and repeated the process for successive targets in different\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nlocations (35 balls). We considered it important to compare subjects’ reaction times during the therapy\nacross the sessions to evaluate the improvements; we hypothesized that faster reaction times indicated\neffective motor learning resulting in motor recovery.\nD. Observation of Patient’s Strategy\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe physiotherapist who participated in the training sessions reported all vital observations, which were\nnecessary to comprehend the patient’s treatment strategies.\nAnalysis and Statistics\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nTo establish the e\u0000cacy of IVR feedback in the recovery of motor coordination, the statistical difference\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nin FM scores between the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions for each patient in both groups was analyzed. For\nfurther analysis, we conducted paired compression test for BI, BA and time to target. The Shapiro-Wilk\ntest was used to check the normality of the distribution, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test or the paired\nStudent’s t-test was applied to evaluate. The level of signi\u0000cance was set at p < 0.05. In addition,\nrepeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed model was employed to determine the in\u0000uence\nof two factors, namely the target locations and the sessions, on the reaction time.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nThe answers derived from the questionnaire were not compared statistically between the groups.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nHowever, subjective experience is crucial for determining whether a larger community would be\ninterested in IVR physical treatment.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nIn this study with stroke patients, we noted that they adopted certain intriguing methods while\nundergoing therapy. The observations were made from the perspective of a physiotherapist. These\n\u0000ndings were considered important in the study because they revealed how the patients coped or\nutilized other motor movements to complete the task. Hence, the patients were separated into distinct\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nTwo signi\u0000cant observations were made in this study. Firstly, each patient underwent a varying number\nof sessions, as outlined in Table 3. This number was correlated with the duration of hospitalization, with\nsome patients receiving \u0000ve sessions and others having more or fewer; there was no standard quantity\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nfor sessions. Secondly, each patient was able to repeat the number of tasks per session according to\ntheir condition and endurance level. Some patients repeated the task twice, while others repeated it more\ntimes per session. Consequently, patients were categorized into three main groups (Table 4).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nTwo sessions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nFour sessions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nFive sessions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nSeven sessions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\n10–14 sessions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nET009 (withdraw)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nTable 4 The number of task repetition per session. The \u0000rst row under each patient's ID indicates the\nnumber of sessions, whereas the second row indicates the number of times they could repeat the task in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe FM score measured predominantly in the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions (seven and eight patients in the\nintervention and control groups, respectively) as shown in Table 5A and B. One patient’s (ET017) data\nwas eliminated from the intervention group because he underwent only four sessions, and we could not\nrepeat the evaluation due to his discharge from the stroke unit. Additionally, two patients (ET013 and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nET019) who stayed longer in the hospital were evaluated three times. Nevertheless, data from only the\n\u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions were analyzed (Table 5A).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nConversely, two patients in the control group (ET010 and ET015) had a full score at the beginning of the\nstudy. However, we repeated the assessment in the \u0000fth session to ensure that there was no\ndeterioration in their motor function, as neurological deterioration is common in some stroke patients\n[62] and we observed that their scores remained unchanged (Table 5B).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nAs shown in (Fig. 4A and B), all seven patients in the intervention group showed improvement in the FM\nscore following IVR-enhanced visual feedback, while only two of eight patients in the control group\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nshowed improvement in the FM score. Moreover, there was no change in the FM score between the \u0000rst\nand \u0000fth sessions for six patients.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nTable 5\nFugel Meyer score for both groups in \u0000rst and last session.

For the intervention group, the p-values obtained from the\nnormality test were 0.23 and 0.02 for FM assessments in the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions, respectively,\nwhereas for the control group, they were 0.03 and 0.01, respectively. Because the data obtained from FM\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nassessments in both groups were not normally distributed, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the\npaired sample comparison of the data. As shown in the box plot in Fig. 5, the FM scores differed\nsigni\u0000cantly between the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions for the intervention group (P = 0.08) but not for the\ncontrol group (P = 0.16), indicating that IVR enhanced the motor function of the affected upper extremity.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nOnly seven patients responded to the questionnaire. Their responses indicate that they were engaged in\nthe therapy, motivated, and felt a sense of achievement. The crucial part was that this therapy induced a\nsense of agency over the virtual hand because they felt as if they were controlling the avatar. Their\nanswers were “somewhat” and “no” when they were asked if they felt dizzy during the therapy. They all\nreported that they experienced no muscle fatigue during the task. Finally, they provided comments\nregarding the therapy, such as “Enjoyed the therapy,” “Therapy was fun,” and “It improved my hand\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\ncoordination and control.” However, one of them stated that the “headset was quite heavy.”\nB. Barthel Index (BI)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.0**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nIn terms of BI, not all individuals were evaluated twice; only nine participants (four in the intervention\ngroup and \u0000ve in control group) had their data recorded twice (see the supplementary \u0000les A1 and A2).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nWe used the Shapiro–Wilk test to compare the normality of the distributions of the two groups’ data. For\nthe intervention group, the p-values obtained from the normality test were 0.07 and 0.02 for the \u0000rst and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nlast sessions, respectively, whereas p-values in the control group were 0.19 and 0.80, respectively. As we\nhad a small data size and some of them were not normally distributed, we considered that our data were\nnot normally distributed.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nTherefore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. We found that BI scores did not differ signi\u0000cantly\nbetween the \u0000rst and last sessions in the intervention group (p = 0.07), whereas they differed\nsigni\u0000cantly in the control group (p = 0.04).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThree of nine patients were excluded from further analysis as the BA could not be calculated because\nthey chose a biased strategy, such as using their affected hand for all the targets (ET001, ET009, and\nET017). We only calculated the BA for each session’s two task repetitions (total of 70 balls). Additionally,\nwe only analyzed the data of patients who underwent \u0000ve sessions and calculated their BA. Patients who\nunderwent less than \u0000ve sessions were therefore excluded from the analysis. Nevertheless, the data\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nfrom only the \u0000rst \u0000ve sessions were analyzed for individuals who underwent more than \u0000ve sessions\n(ET013, ET018, and ET019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nWe excluded the patient whose right side was affected (ET017) from the analysis because the data of\nthe patient could not be combined with that of the group with the left side affected as each group had a\ndifferent strategy for achieving targets. Before performing the paired comparison analysis, we used the\nShapiro–Wilk test to ensure that the data met normal distribution requirements. The p-values obtained\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nfrom the test for normality were 0.20, 0.15, 0.83, 0.52, and 0.59 for sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\nOwing to the normal distribution of the BA data across all sessions, we used the paired Student's t-test to\nassess the differences in BA between sessions and the results indicated that there was no statistically\nsigni\u0000cant difference across the session, as indicated by a p-value greater than 0.05. Unlike the healthy\nparticipants in Sakabe et al. study [48] the stroke patients used a different strategy to reach the target.\nFor example, they developed their own exercise plan, i.e., they used the affected hand only in reaching\nmost of the targets, and other time they train the non-affected side.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nOne participant was excluded from further analysis (ET008), for the reason that his reaction time was\naffected because of spatial neglect, for example, lack of attention towards the targets near the affected\nside and he needed to be reminded to refocus his attention. Furthermore, he employed a distinct\napproach when attempting to reach the target.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 16.0**b== 0.0**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nWe found that the patients with left-side impairment were always able to reach the targets closest to the\naffected side (targets 7, 6, and 5) but occasionally reached the other targets, whereas patients with right-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nside impairment were always able to reach targets 1, 2, and 3. Hence, a repeated measures analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) mixed model was employed to determine the in\u0000uence of two factors, namely the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ntarget locations and the sessions, on the reaction time. The analysis revealed that there is no statistically\nsigni\u0000cant difference in the Targets (p = 0.67). However, a signi\u0000cant difference was seen between\nsessions (\u0000rst and last) (P < 0.01).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nTherefore, we combined the average value of the reaction time of targets 5, 6, and 7 for the left sided\npatients and targets 1, 2 and 3 for the right sided patients. We then proceeded to compare the results\nobtained from the \u0000rst and last sessions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nBefore the paired sample comparison test, we used the Shapiro–Wilk test to determine whether the data\nmet the normal distribution criteria. The resulting p-value was P < 0.05, indicating that the data were not\nnormally distributed. We then performed the Wilcoxon signed rank test on eight patients in order to\nreveal the improvement of motor recovery between the \u0000rst and last session in terms of the reaction\ntime of the affected hand.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nBased on the box plot depicted in (Fig. 6), there is a statistically signi\u0000cant difference found between the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\n\u0000rst session and the last session (P = 0.03), suggesting the motor recovery of the affected limb in terms\nof kinematics. In contrast, we found that there was no motor learning on the unaffected upper limb (P =\n0.20).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nWe subgrouped the patients based on the similarity of their strategies and highlighted the following three\nsigni\u0000cant characteristics from the therapist’s observation:\n**BLOCK**fs== 21.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nI. Patients Categorized Based on the Frequency Hand\nUsage (Affected or Unaffected hand)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.3**\nBased on the recorded data, we identi\u0000ed two categories of patients;\n1. The Frequency of Using the Affected Side\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 17.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThis category comprised two types of patients who predominantly used their affected hand to reach the\nmajority of targets, potentially indicating self-motivation and competitiveness. The \u0000rst type achieving ≥\n80% of the affected hand usage (28 targets out of 35), The second type patients used 71–77% (25 to 27\ntargets out of 35). Notably, this method was not used for every session; for example, patient ET001 used\nboth methods.\n2. The Frequency of Using the Unaffected Side\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThis category included patients who did not use the affected hand to reach targets because they wanted\nto train the opposite side; they used the affected 25% (0 to 8 times out of 35).\nII. Patients Categorized Based on Strategy for Reaching\nTargets\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.2**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nEach patient employed a unique strategy for achieving the targets. For instance, some patients utilized\ntrunk movement to assist in reaching the target, while others switched to their unaffected hand if they\nwere unable to reach the target, returned to their starting position, and repeated the task. Additionally,\ncertain patients exhibited circumduction movements rather than moving in a direct line. Moreover, some\npatients tapped the table upon successfully reaching the target.\nIII. Patient Categorised Based on Factors Affecting\nPerformance\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nSome patients exhibited characteristics that could affect their performance. For instance, neglecting the\naffected side resulted in overlooking targets close to that side, while leaning towards the affected side\nled to neglecting targets on the opposite side. Others had hand deformities, although this did not impact\nthe e\u0000cacy of the system. Additionally, negative mood and lack of sleep were observed to have\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThe primary goal of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of IVR technology in the upper limb\nrehabilitation of stroke patients, as opposed to traditional CIMT that combines positive reinforcement in\nPT. Our study by [48] con\u0000rmed that positive reinforcement in IVR in\u0000uences hand usage decisions in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nhealthy participants. In this study, we modi\u0000ed the IVR system in order to meet the speci\u0000c requirements\nof the patients by reducing the target number and extending the time limit to reach the targets. The\ne\u0000cacy of the IVR-enhanced PT was validated using the Fugl-Meyer (FM) assessment to test the\nimprovement of the upper limb motion with respect to the control group.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nBased on our \u0000ndings, it is evident that the intervention group, which received IVR combined with\nconventional physical therapy (PT), exhibited improvement in the FM score in all patients compared to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthe control group (Table 5 and Figs. 4 and 5) which received only PT. This observation is promising,\nindicating a positive trajectory that may offer insights into the e\u0000cacy of the IVR intervention. The\npositive outcomes observed in the intervention group suggest the effectiveness of IVR in enhancing\nmotor function. However, the question persists: Can this improvement be attributed solely to the system,\nthe physiotherapy sessions, or their combined synergistic impact, serving as compelling evidence of\ne\u0000cacy?\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nVR is frequently compared to conventional therapy (CT) administered by physio- and occupational\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 18.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\ntherapists in studies on stroke rehabilitation. The updated Cochrane review by Laver et al. [8] concluded\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nthat the e\u0000cacy of VR-based therapy was not superior to that of CT in enhancing upper limb function.\nSpeci\u0000cally, they reported that VR “may be bene\u0000cial in improving upper limb function and ADL function\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nwhen used as an adjunct to conventional care (to increase overall therapy time)”. It is essential to note\nthat their study primarily focused on commercial video gaming consoles, a prevalent choice in VR-based\nrehabilitation due to their ease of use, enjoyment, and cost-effectiveness [63, 64]. Nevertheless, present-\nday researchers are increasingly avoiding these approaches as these systems are primarily designed for\nhealthy individuals, thereby presenting signi\u0000cant challenges for patients [63]. Consequently, our study\nimplemented an IVR system that is tailored to the speci\u0000c requirements, bene\u0000ts, and conditions of the\npatients. The inherent simplicity of this approach may account for the observed improvement in their FM\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nThis simplicity aligns seamlessly with the overarching goals of stroke rehabilitation, particularly when\nconsidering early initiation to minimize the disease's impact. Given that the participants in our study\nwere acute cases, we promptly initiated IVR in combination with PT once they were medically stable. The\ncombination of therapies in our study, emphasizing both task-oriented exercises and repetitive\nmovements, holds the potential to facilitate patient recovery through intensive treatment.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nIn IVR training, it involved task-oriented exercises, particularly actions like reaching for ball—a movement\nintegral to activities of daily living (ADL) that frequently necessitates the use of the arm [65, 66].\nAdditionally, the task contained repetitive movements [67]. This approach has the potential to enhance\nneuroplasticity [68, 69] by facilitating the restoration of movement on the impaired side through the\nactivation of a new motor projection region and the resting of synapses [70, 71]. As mentioned in\nprevious studies [8, 70, 72, 73], the current focus in clinical settings is on the combined use of VR and PT\nfor rehabilitation. These associated technologies are becoming more accessible and prevalent [74].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nNevertheless, within the domain of VR, the direct effects of VR therapy on neuroplasticity are still under\ninvestigation, and current evidence is limited [8]. However, Wang et al. [70] employed functional magnetic\nresonance imaging to investigate neuronal remodelling in subacute stroke patients before and after\ntraining with a Leap Motion-based VR system. They compared it to CT alone. Patients were instructed to\nposition their affected thumb on their palm. They found that sensorimotor cortex activation moved from\nthe ipsilateral to the contralateral region and increased in the contralateral cortex in both groups. On the\nWolf motor function test, which assesses upper limb motor function, the experimental VR group had a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.0**r== 0.0**\nsigni\u0000cantly greater improvement and better performance than the control group. These results\ndemonstrate that repeated exercises with the affected arm combined with task-oriented practice in a\nvirtual environment can enhance motor recovery of the upper limb more than CT alone. Neuroimaging\nresearch can help increase the training-dependent effects of VR and contribute to the development of VR\ntherapies. These \u0000ndings add to the current evidence that VR therapy should not be ignored in upper limb\nrehabilitation, as it may have apparent advantages for patients’ recovery. More conclusive \u0000ndings to\ndate suggest that VR can improve PT and increase the potential for rehabilitation [51, 52, 75, 76, 77].\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 19.0**b== 0.0**t== 0.9**l== 0.0**r== 0.1**\nRather than relying solely on a single method, incorporating VR therapy into existing rehabilitation\nprograms appears effective for enhancing stroke rehabilitation outcomes.",

Read Full License   motor impairment of the upper limb (UL) after a stroke is common, which negatively impacts patients’ quality of life. Stroke survivors may develop a condition known as learned non-use, resulting in a tendency to avoid using the affected hand due to failure. Previous research has shown that constraint-   induced movement therapy (CIMT), where the healthy arm is physically constrained to encourage the use of the stroke-affected arm, is effective in UL rehabilitation. However, some patients \u0000nd it exhausting and tiring. New technologies have been applied to stroke rehabilitation alongside conventional techniques in recent years. For example, immersive virtual reality (IVR) has emerged as a new treatment approach for stroke rehabilitation, simulating real-life activities to work on self-care skills. Method: in this pilot study,   we evaluated the e\u0000cacy of the IVR, which incorporates positive reinforcement components in motor coordination as opposed to CIMT using IVR technology. Eighteen participants were randomized to an IVR group to receive VR intervention plus physical therapy (PT) sessions or a control group to receive PT sessions alone. Participants were instructed to reach with either their affected or unaffected hand to a   randomly assigned target in the VR. The movement of the virtual image of the UL was reinforced by visual feedback to the participants. Treatment effects on motor recovery were investigated using the Fugl-Meyer (FM) scale for the UL, kinematic dataset, and a questionnaire.   the IVR group exhibited signi\u0000cant improvements in FM scores (p < 0.05) between the \u0000rst and \u0000fth session, signifying a substantial recovery of UL motor function, with the \u0000fth session showing higher   scores. The time to target in the last session reduced compared with that in the \u0000rst session, suggesting motor learning and recovery (p < 0.05). The patients were highly engaged and motivated during the sessions because they felt like they were in charge of the virtual image of their upper body.   The results suggest that positive reinforcement within the IVR could encourage motor recovery of the affected hand and may facilitate the application of motor learning and neuroplasticity principles during neurological rehabilitation.   A stroke occurs when blood \u0000ow to the brain is interrupted or is insu\u0000cient, leading to brain injury or cell death and subsequent impairment of physical and mental functions [1–3]. This may cause sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments as well as impaired self-care ability and participation in social and communal activities [4, 5]. The number of stroke deaths in England decreased by half during the \u0000rst   decade of the 21st century [6], and in 2018 it ranked as the fourth leading cause of mortality [7]. Nonetheless, a signi\u0000cant proportion of stroke survivors continue to live with disabilities. Motor impairment is the most common complication after a stroke, and it can negatively affect health and motor skills, particularly when it affects the upper limbs [8, 9].   According to Adamovich et al. [10], stroke patients undergoing treatment for upper limb impairment encounter various challenges. The functional outcome is highly variable; some patients are unable to fully recover functionality and are forced to live with varying degrees of upper limb paresis for the rest of their lives. It has also been reported that the treatment of upper limb hemiparesis is time-sensitive and   involves various therapeutic modalities [11, 12]. Thus, these scienti\u0000c studies emphasize the need for appropriate rehabilitation procedures that can provide highly effective therapy and a greater possibility of a higher-level functional recovery. Successful rehabilitation depends on the stroke’s characteristics (such as severity, nature, and location) as well as the patient’s age, general health, and pre-stroke function [13].   Otherwise, the stroke patient whose impaired hand is rendered inactive for an extended period may acquire learned non-use. Learned non-use is the outcome of repeated unsuccessful attempts to use the affected upper limb coupled with the reinforcement of compensatory methods (such as the use of the unaffected upper limb), which leads to deterrence in using the affected arm [14–17]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the optimal rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients with upper limb disability and limitations.   According to the International Classi\u0000cation of Functioning, Disability, and Health, physiotherapists are an essential component of multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation teams [18, 19], as they assist patients in regaining mobility and independence by addressing impairments in bodily functions, activity limitations, and participation restrictions [20]. To recover movement, coordination, and balance, a physiotherapist   provides conventional physical therapy (PT) for upper limb rehabilitation through exercises, training, and physical movement of the limbs [21].   It has been established that repetitive task training is bene\u0000cial in certain aspects of rehabilitation, such   as improving upper limb function [22, 23]. Hence, the term “sensory motor training” was established to represent various physical activities designed to improve motor performance, strength, power, endurance, and sensory integrity, such as proprioception. Moreover, the neuroscience and rehabilitation literature are supporting the idea that task-speci\u0000c or task-oriented practice is essential for restoring functionality in stroke-impaired limbs. This implies that repeatedly practicing a di\u0000cult activity can alter brain networks responsible for motor control, leading to long-term improvements in motor learning and   Motor coordination can only be regained through a neuroplasticity process [25], which is described as the rewiring of the brain’s synaptic connections to develop appropriate communication with the body’s   The most crucial component is performing repeated movements, which provides patients with the ability   to perform an activity normally [27]. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been reported to be effective in treating severe paralysis in the body by training the nerve impulses of damaged muscles   through constant repetition of movement on the affected side [23, 28, 29]. However, CIMT has major disadvantages, such as exhausting the patient owing to its intensity [30, 31]. Consequently, recent   technological solutions have shown promise in terms of improving the function of impaired limbs without exhausting patients.   Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a new treatment approach for stroke rehabilitation, simulating real-   life activities to improve self-care skills [32, 33]. In virtual rehabilitation, patients receive visual feedback from simulated environments and objects through a head-mounted device, projection system, or \u0000at   screen, while all body senses offer feedback [34]. Virtual tasks and environments affect the users’ senses, and they perceive their presence in the virtual world [35, 36]. By adjusting stimuli to movements   in real time and incorporating and modifying feedback, VR may enhance the application of motor   learning and neuroplasticity principles during rehabilitation [35] as it provides components (such as goal- oriented tasks and repetition) demonstrated to be vital in rehabilitation [10].   Although there is limited evidence of neuroplasticity during VR training, neuroimaging discoveries are   guiding the development of VR to meet the highest treatment standards [37]. As technology becomes a broader component of daily life, it is anticipated that the use of VR in rehabilitation settings will increase   [38, 39]. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of VR in order to de\u0000ne its future designs and implementations. The VR environment motivates patients to perform repetitive, motor-intensive tasks   that are crucial for rehabilitation [40–44]. Compared with conventional rehabilitation techniques, a concise adaptive game can improve mobility, motor function, and mental wellbeing.   Neurological patients generally lack therapy motivation [44]. Possible explanations for this lack of   motivation include patients’ belief that therapy only intends to enable adaptation to the disease rather than providing complete healing, or a lack of motivating input from a therapist [44, 45]. Other logistic,   \u0000nancial, environmental, and human obstacles may restrict the e\u0000cacy and commitment to long-term   rehabilitation regimens [42] found that combining VR with modi\u0000ed CIMT encouraged stroke patients to use the affected hand without constraining the unaffected side (both hands were free to move). Another   study investigated the safety and effectiveness of VR and modi\u0000ed CIMT [46].   Relevant to our investigation, [47] proposed a new treatment that combines CIMT and reinforcement- induced movement therapy (RIMT). They demonstrated the e\u0000cacy of RIMT by speeding up the hindered   hand in VR using the goal-oriented reaching task. After the RIMT intervention, the Fugl-Meyer (FM) scores of stroke patients improved; however, their study did not report the subjective feeling of being   completely engaged in VR. Although they pioneered positive reinforcement utilizing computer-simulated limbs in the display, the RIMT concept should be developed to use immersive VR (IVR).   Visual feedback in IVR simply displays the simulated upper limb. Only the simulated hand should be seen   during the task. If people watch their real hand move in front of them while viewing the simulated hand   on the display, the discrepancy in visual feedback of motor coordination will induce a sense of loss of   ownership of the simulated upper limb or, in certain situations, the subjective awareness of the loss of bodily control.   Our study by [48] that used IVR on healthy subjects with a weight attached to their dominant hand to   simulate the impairment of a stroke patient is also relevant to our investigation. Their system was portable (head-mounted VR), and the objective was to reach a target in VR without forcing the subjects   to use their dominant hand, with an option to use either hand. The movement of the virtual image of the upper limb was reinforced by visual feedback to the participants, such that they perceived their motor   coordination as if their upper limb was moving to a greater extent than normal. These \u0000ndings suggest that positive reinforcement within IVR can in\u0000uence hand usage decision-making.   Thus, herein, we modi\u0000ed the protocol developed by [48] for stroke survivors to accommodate the   speci\u0000c requirements of the patients, including extended task completion time and breaks to prevent fatigue, as detailed in the method section. Our study aimed to evaluate a new therapeutic approach for   the rehabilitation of the upper limbs of stroke patients to demonstrate the effectiveness of IVR-enhanced   PT by measuring the improvement in upper limb motion using the FM score. Additionally, to conduct a larger study in the future, a participant experience questionnaire was administered to evaluate the   Eighteen subjects (69.4 ± 13.5 years, eight women) with acute post-stroke hemiparesis (16 ischemic strokes) were recruited in the study at the stroke unit of the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, United   Kingdom. The sample size was limited by the number of patients that could be enrolled over the project’s duration. The experiment was approved by the ethics committee Health Research Authority and Health   and Care Research Wales (IRAS project ID: 264096) and performed according to relevant guidelines and   The participants were screened for study eligibility by the clinical team according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were (i) age ≥ 18 years; (ii) recent stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic) within the last 4 weeks; (iii) Montreal Cognitive Assessment score > 18; (iv) ability to sit independently in a chair; (v) upper limb weakness; and (vi) ability to speak and read English. The exclusion criteria were (i)   visual \u0000eld defect; (ii) visual or sensory neglect; (iii) strokes affecting both upper limbs; (iv) poor static and dynamic balance in sitting; (v) shoulder subluxation or dislocation; (vi) upper limb weakness due to   conditions other than stroke; (vii) presence of emotional and/or cognitive de\u0000cits (such as global aphasia, apraxia, dementia, and depression) that could interfere with the understanding and execution of   Participants provided written informed consent after being informed about the aims and procedure of   the experiment. They were allocated to either receive IVR and conventional PT (intervention group, 10 patients) or receive conventional PT alone (control group, 8 patients) (Tables 1 and 2). Both groups   received conventional PT on the ward, administered in accordance with national guidelines. The patient allocation, conducted through a randomization process, occurred at a 1:1 ratio using pre-prepared sealed   opaque envelopes. These envelopes, numbered by the Trust the Research & Development department before recruitment began, contained information identifying the assigned group for each patient. To   ensure equitable and unbiased distribution, an online random number generator utilizing atmospheric noise assigned numbers to each envelope [49]. The research team sequentially opened the sealed   envelopes (numbered 1–30) to determine group allocation for each participant. Additionally, the   assigned number served as the participant identi\u0000cation number throughout the study. This rigorous randomization process aimed to enhance the validity and reliability of the research \u0000ndings.   Participants could withdraw consent at any time during the study, yet the collected data were retained   and used without additional procedures on or in relation to the participant. Two patients in the intervention group withdrew from the trial owing to di\u0000culty to complete the task, a perception of   therapy being ineffective, or a desire to concentrate more on the lower limb.

An integrated IVR system consists of a VR headset (Oculus Rift) and a small motion   capture sensor (Leap Motion) attached to the headset (Fig. 1) Both products are CE marked. This system can monitor the actual upper limb movements of the participants and create a virtual image of the corresponding upper limb in the IVR environment. It also provides a real time motion of the corresponding virtual upper limb. The person using IVR equipment can “look around” the arti\u0000cial world   and interact with virtual features or objects. Through iterative visual-motor loops in the brain, the person experiences a feeling of controlling the virtual image of their body in such a way that the virtual world can be perceived as a real one. Stroke survivors go through task-oriented training of the upper limb in the   IVR environment. As they experience the ideal motor coordination of their upper limb’s avatar, successful matching of motor intention and resultant motor coordination in the IVR allows brain networks to form new neuronal pathways for spontaneous motion in their daily life. Therefore, IVR-enhanced therapy may offer a powerful rehabilitation approach, allowing PT to be tailored to the speci\u0000c needs of survivors with   Participants were asked to sit comfortably on a chair and place their upper extremities on a table in front of them (Fig. 1A). Seven targets were arranged in a semi-circular orientation within the IVR environment (Fig. 2A). As a goal-oriented task, participants were asked to reach for the target immediately by choosing their healthy or impaired upper limb hand (Fig. 2B). To implement reinforcement-induced PT,   the velocity of the hand of the impaired upper limb was ampli\u0000ed in the virtual environment in the direction of the target. The target turned blue when reached by the virtual hand and immediately disappeared. Unlike for healthy individuals, we increased the time to 4 seconds after the ball appeared to prevent in-depth consideration regarding choosing, as stroke patients require more time. If this condition   was not ful\u0000lled, the target disappeared, and the trial was invalidated.   The experiment included three stages: familiarization, intervention, and washout (Fig. 3). At each stage, visual ampli\u0000cation is consistently applied to the affected side (right or left), in contrast to the healthy experiment where the visual ampli\u0000cation depended on the experimental phase, speci\u0000cally for the right   side. The visual ampli\u0000cation, de\u0000ned as increasing the velocity of the virtual hand corresponding to the impaired upper limb by 1.4 times compared to the actual hand motion, will be described. It was hypothesized that the participants would start to use the affected hand more often as the velocity was ampli\u0000ed in the IVR environment.   The aim of the familiarization stage was to acquaint the participants with the task. In this stage, \u0000ve targets (excluding the far right and far left targets) appeared randomly in a semi-circular array in the virtual environment (see Fig. 2A), each target appeared four times. For example, participants completed   20 reaching trials, equally divided between using the right hand (the \u0000ve targets appearing twice) and the left hand in 10 trials each (the \u0000ve targets appearing twice). This stage was applied only once at the beginning of each session.   Subsequently, the primary stage in this experiment was the intervention stage/free choice stage, wherein the participants were free to choose the right or left hand (unaffected or affected limb) to reach the target that randomly appeared in seven different positions. To accommodate the patients in the study,   we reduced the number of times they reached for the ball from 70 to 35 (5 times per target), This adjustment was implemented due to our concern about potential participant fatigue. Post-stroke fatigue, which is prevalent throughout the acute and chronic phases following a stroke and can substantially impact rehabilitation outcomes, should also be considered when designing a treatment plan [50]. Due to   brain damage and limb weakening, stroke survivors are more likely to experience fatigue than healthy individuals. In this stage, the participants repeated the reaching task at their own pace, with varying repetitions per person in each session. Each task comprised 35 balls and lasted for 3–5 minutes. To   avoid fatigue, participants were given 2-minute rest periods between each task. The term \"session\" refers to the time when patients receive IVR training, occurring once per day. The number of sessions is   determined by the duration of the patient's hospital stay until discharge or completion of 15 sessions— whichever comes sooner.   The \u0000nal stage was the washout, similar to the intervention stage (35 target per task) but gradual   reduction in the velocity of ampli\u0000cation in the IVR environment to 1.2 times the actual hand motion. We hypothesized that even when the ampli\u0000cation is reduced in the IVR environment, the participants would continue to utilize the affected upper limb, resulting in increased use of the affected upper limb in daily life. This stage was intended to commence from the 10th session and extend until the 15th session.   However, because of early discharge of patients, we could complete this stage with only two patients. The entire session lasted for 20–40 minutes, depending on the patient’s condition.   The Fugl Meyer for upper limb (FM) assessment was used to evaluate the functional motor condition as   the primary outcome in this study. FM score was selected as the primary outcome measure because FM assessment is a well-designed, feasible, and effective clinical examination technique that has been extensively used in the stroke population [51–54]. This scale is highly recommended as a clinical and   research instrument for assessing changes in motor impairment after stroke [55]. The evaluation was conducted by a physiotherapist who participated in the program. The FM assessment is crucial for determining motor recovery and disease severity [56]. It has \u0000ve domains: motor function, sensory function, balance, joint range of motion, and joint pain [57, 58]. The motor function domain is the most   widely used and plays a primary role in monitoring motor recovery after stroke. The items in the FM motor function domain are based on patient motion, coordination, and re\u0000ex action in the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. Each domain contains multiple items, each scored on a 3-point ordinal   scale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially, 2 = performs fully). The total score varies from 0 to 66. The measurements were utilized to assess the e\u0000cacy of IVR feedback in restoring motor coordination affecting the patient’s QoL. Our initial plan was to collect FM scores from participants at the beginning, middle, and end of their participation in the study. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the   length of hospitalization varied, and patients could be discharged without notice. Hence, depending on the length of stay, we evaluated the patients in the \u0000rst, \u0000fth, and tenth sessions. The control group underwent evaluations during corresponding sessions, ensuring consistent assessment across both groups with the same timescales as the intervention group. Note that the ethical approval allowed a   certain period for our clinical study, not allowing us to extend our study to recruit more patients.   We used a questionnaire administered at the end of the last session to evaluate patient experience, provide information regarding the sense of agency (subjective awareness of initiating and controlling one’s own activities) [59], and obtain comments about the training sessions in the IVR environment. The questionnaire contained four short items that required participants to respond with a simple “yes,” “no,”   • Did you feel that you were controlling the virtual hand?   • Did you feel a sense of achievement during the virtual reality therapy?   • Did you feel dizzy when looking around in the virtual reality?   • Did you feel any fatigue in any of your muscles during the therapy?   • If you have any comments or feedback on your experience, please include them below. B. Barthel Index (Clinical Outcome)   The Barthel index (BI; modi\u0000ed 10-item version) is used to measure the amount of independence and mobility of patients in their activities of daily living (ADL), such as feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing,   bowel control, bladder control, toileting, chair transfer, ambulation, and stair climbing [60]. The evaluation was conducted by a physiotherapist who was not involved in the training. This tool indicates the need for assistance in care and is widely used as a measure of functional disability [61]. Depending on the item, functional categories may be rated 0–1, 0–2, or 0–3 points. The range of possible total scores is 0–20.   Two measurements were taken at both the baseline and discharge stages.   To evaluate the use of unaffected and affected hands in the VR environment during the training sessions based on enhanced visual feedback, we calculated the border angle (BA) of the \u0000rst two repetitions of   the task (total of 70 times) in each patient across the sessions. A psychometric function was \u0000tted to the plots of the probability of affected hand usage as a function of the target angles; (see Fig. 2B in [48]). The angle at which the psychometric function corresponds to a 50% probability was de\u0000ned as the BA. II. Time to Target   To determine the time to target for each subject, the reaction time of the affected hand for each target was recorded, encompassing the duration from the ball's onset to the participant reaching it. Each trial commenced with participants placing their hands at the starting point (home position), triggering the   appearance of the ball upon accurate hand placement. Following this, participants reached the target, returned their hands to the starting position, and repeated the process for successive targets in different   locations (35 balls). We considered it important to compare subjects’ reaction times during the therapy across the sessions to evaluate the improvements; we hypothesized that faster reaction times indicated effective motor learning resulting in motor recovery. D. Observation of Patient’s Strategy   The physiotherapist who participated in the training sessions reported all vital observations, which were necessary to comprehend the patient’s treatment strategies. Analysis and Statistics   To establish the e\u0000cacy of IVR feedback in the recovery of motor coordination, the statistical difference   in FM scores between the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions for each patient in both groups was analyzed. For further analysis, we conducted paired compression test for BI, BA and time to target. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check the normality of the distribution, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test or the paired Student’s t-test was applied to evaluate. The level of signi\u0000cance was set at p < 0.05. In addition, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed model was employed to determine the in\u0000uence of two factors, namely the target locations and the sessions, on the reaction time.   The answers derived from the questionnaire were not compared statistically between the groups.   However, subjective experience is crucial for determining whether a larger community would be interested in IVR physical treatment.   In this study with stroke patients, we noted that they adopted certain intriguing methods while undergoing therapy. The observations were made from the perspective of a physiotherapist. These \u0000ndings were considered important in the study because they revealed how the patients coped or utilized other motor movements to complete the task. Hence, the patients were separated into distinct   Two signi\u0000cant observations were made in this study. Firstly, each patient underwent a varying number of sessions, as outlined in Table 3. This number was correlated with the duration of hospitalization, with some patients receiving \u0000ve sessions and others having more or fewer; there was no standard quantity   for sessions. Secondly, each patient was able to repeat the number of tasks per session according to their condition and endurance level. Some patients repeated the task twice, while others repeated it more times per session. Consequently, patients were categorized into three main groups (Table 4).   Two sessions   Four sessions   Five sessions   Seven sessions   10–14 sessions   ET009 (withdraw)   Table 4 The number of task repetition per session. The \u0000rst row under each patient's ID indicates the number of sessions, whereas the second row indicates the number of times they could repeat the task in   The FM score measured predominantly in the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions (seven and eight patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively) as shown in Table 5A and B. One patient’s (ET017) data was eliminated from the intervention group because he underwent only four sessions, and we could not repeat the evaluation due to his discharge from the stroke unit. Additionally, two patients (ET013 and   ET019) who stayed longer in the hospital were evaluated three times. Nevertheless, data from only the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions were analyzed (Table 5A).   Conversely, two patients in the control group (ET010 and ET015) had a full score at the beginning of the study. However, we repeated the assessment in the \u0000fth session to ensure that there was no deterioration in their motor function, as neurological deterioration is common in some stroke patients [62] and we observed that their scores remained unchanged (Table 5B).   As shown in (Fig. 4A and B), all seven patients in the intervention group showed improvement in the FM score following IVR-enhanced visual feedback, while only two of eight patients in the control group   showed improvement in the FM score. Moreover, there was no change in the FM score between the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions for six patients.   Table 5 Fugel Meyer score for both groups in \u0000rst and last session. (A) FM scores for the intervention (A) and control (B) groups. The differences in FM scores between the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions for each patient are displayed in both tables. The data in red indicate an improvement. (The total score of FM is = 66).   Intervention group   Control group   FM_5th_ session   Before conducting paired comparison analysis, we used the Shapiro–Wilk test to ensure that the data met normal distribution requirements. For the intervention group, the p-values obtained from the normality test were 0.23 and 0.02 for FM assessments in the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions, respectively, whereas for the control group, they were 0.03 and 0.01, respectively. Because the data obtained from FM   assessments in both groups were not normally distributed, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the paired sample comparison of the data. As shown in the box plot in Fig. 5, the FM scores differed signi\u0000cantly between the \u0000rst and \u0000fth sessions for the intervention group (P = 0.08) but not for the control group (P = 0.16), indicating that IVR enhanced the motor function of the affected upper extremity.   Only seven patients responded to the questionnaire. Their responses indicate that they were engaged in the therapy, motivated, and felt a sense of achievement. The crucial part was that this therapy induced a sense of agency over the virtual hand because they felt as if they were controlling the avatar. Their answers were “somewhat” and “no” when they were asked if they felt dizzy during the therapy. They all reported that they experienced no muscle fatigue during the task. Finally, they provided comments regarding the therapy, such as “Enjoyed the therapy,” “Therapy was fun,” and “It improved my hand   coordination and control.” However, one of them stated that the “headset was quite heavy.” B. Barthel Index (BI)   In terms of BI, not all individuals were evaluated twice; only nine participants (four in the intervention group and \u0000ve in control group) had their data recorded twice (see the supplementary \u0000les A1 and A2).   We used the Shapiro–Wilk test to compare the normality of the distributions of the two groups’ data. For the intervention group, the p-values obtained from the normality test were 0.07 and 0.02 for the \u0000rst and   last sessions, respectively, whereas p-values in the control group were 0.19 and 0.80, respectively. As we had a small data size and some of them were not normally distributed, we considered that our data were not normally distributed.   Therefore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. We found that BI scores did not differ signi\u0000cantly between the \u0000rst and last sessions in the intervention group (p = 0.07), whereas they differed signi\u0000cantly in the control group (p = 0.04).   Three of nine patients were excluded from further analysis as the BA could not be calculated because they chose a biased strategy, such as using their affected hand for all the targets (ET001, ET009, and ET017). We only calculated the BA for each session’s two task repetitions (total of 70 balls). Additionally, we only analyzed the data of patients who underwent \u0000ve sessions and calculated their BA. Patients who underwent less than \u0000ve sessions were therefore excluded from the analysis. Nevertheless, the data   from only the \u0000rst \u0000ve sessions were analyzed for individuals who underwent more than \u0000ve sessions (ET013, ET018, and ET019).   We excluded the patient whose right side was affected (ET017) from the analysis because the data of the patient could not be combined with that of the group with the left side affected as each group had a different strategy for achieving targets. Before performing the paired comparison analysis, we used the Shapiro–Wilk test to ensure that the data met normal distribution requirements. The p-values obtained   from the test for normality were 0.20, 0.15, 0.83, 0.52, and 0.59 for sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Owing to the normal distribution of the BA data across all sessions, we used the paired Student's t-test to assess the differences in BA between sessions and the results indicated that there was no statistically signi\u0000cant difference across the session, as indicated by a p-value greater than 0.05. Unlike the healthy participants in Sakabe et al. study [48] the stroke patients used a different strategy to reach the target. For example, they developed their own exercise plan, i.e., they used the affected hand only in reaching most of the targets, and other time they train the non-affected side.   One participant was excluded from further analysis (ET008), for the reason that his reaction time was affected because of spatial neglect, for example, lack of attention towards the targets near the affected side and he needed to be reminded to refocus his attention. Furthermore, he employed a distinct approach when attempting to reach the target.   We found that the patients with left-side impairment were always able to reach the targets closest to the affected side (targets 7, 6, and 5) but occasionally reached the other targets, whereas patients with right-   side impairment were always able to reach targets 1, 2, and 3. Hence, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed model was employed to determine the in\u0000uence of two factors, namely the   target locations and the sessions, on the reaction time. The analysis revealed that there is no statistically signi\u0000cant difference in the Targets (p = 0.67). However, a signi\u0000cant difference was seen between sessions (\u0000rst and last) (P < 0.01).   Therefore, we combined the average value of the reaction time of targets 5, 6, and 7 for the left sided patients and targets 1, 2 and 3 for the right sided patients. We then proceeded to compare the results obtained from the \u0000rst and last sessions.   Before the paired sample comparison test, we used the Shapiro–Wilk test to determine whether the data met the normal distribution criteria. The resulting p-value was P < 0.05, indicating that the data were not normally distributed. We then performed the Wilcoxon signed rank test on eight patients in order to reveal the improvement of motor recovery between the \u0000rst and last session in terms of the reaction time of the affected hand.   Based on the box plot depicted in (Fig. 6), there is a statistically signi\u0000cant difference found between the   \u0000rst session and the last session (P = 0.03), suggesting the motor recovery of the affected limb in terms of kinematics. In contrast, we found that there was no motor learning on the unaffected upper limb (P = 0.20).   We subgrouped the patients based on the similarity of their strategies and highlighted the following three signi\u0000cant characteristics from the therapist’s observation:   I. Patients Categorized Based on the Frequency Hand Usage (Affected or Unaffected hand)   Based on the recorded data, we identi\u0000ed two categories of patients; 1. The Frequency of Using the Affected Side   This category comprised two types of patients who predominantly used their affected hand to reach the majority of targets, potentially indicating self-motivation and competitiveness. The \u0000rst type achieving ≥ 80% of the affected hand usage (28 targets out of 35), The second type patients used 71–77% (25 to 27 targets out of 35). Notably, this method was not used for every session; for example, patient ET001 used both methods. 2. The Frequency of Using the Unaffected Side   This category included patients who did not use the affected hand to reach targets because they wanted to train the opposite side; they used the affected 25% (0 to 8 times out of 35). II. Patients Categorized Based on Strategy for Reaching Targets   Each patient employed a unique strategy for achieving the targets. For instance, some patients utilized trunk movement to assist in reaching the target, while others switched to their unaffected hand if they were unable to reach the target, returned to their starting position, and repeated the task. Additionally, certain patients exhibited circumduction movements rather than moving in a direct line. Moreover, some patients tapped the table upon successfully reaching the target. III. Patient Categorised Based on Factors Affecting Performance   Some patients exhibited characteristics that could affect their performance. For instance, neglecting the affected side resulted in overlooking targets close to that side, while leaning towards the affected side led to neglecting targets on the opposite side. Others had hand deformities, although this did not impact the e\u0000cacy of the system. Additionally, negative mood and lack of sleep were observed to have   The primary goal of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of IVR technology in the upper limb rehabilitation of stroke patients, as opposed to traditional CIMT that combines positive reinforcement in PT. Our study by [48] con\u0000rmed that positive reinforcement in IVR in\u0000uences hand usage decisions in   healthy participants. In this study, we modi\u0000ed the IVR system in order to meet the speci\u0000c requirements of the patients by reducing the target number and extending the time limit to reach the targets. The e\u0000cacy of the IVR-enhanced PT was validated using the Fugl-Meyer (FM) assessment to test the improvement of the upper limb motion with respect to the control group.   Based on our \u0000ndings, it is evident that the intervention group, which received IVR combined with conventional physical therapy (PT), exhibited improvement in the FM score in all patients compared to   the control group (Table 5 and Figs. 4 and 5) which received only PT. This observation is promising, indicating a positive trajectory that may offer insights into the e\u0000cacy of the IVR intervention. The positive outcomes observed in the intervention group suggest the effectiveness of IVR in enhancing motor function. However, the question persists: Can this improvement be attributed solely to the system, the physiotherapy sessions, or their combined synergistic impact, serving as compelling evidence of e\u0000cacy?   VR is frequently compared to conventional therapy (CT) administered by physio- and occupational   therapists in studies on stroke rehabilitation. The updated Cochrane review by Laver et al. [8] concluded   that the e\u0000cacy of VR-based therapy was not superior to that of CT in enhancing upper limb function. Speci\u0000cally, they reported that VR “may be bene\u0000cial in improving upper limb function and ADL function   when used as an adjunct to conventional care (to increase overall therapy time)”. It is essential to note that their study primarily focused on commercial video gaming consoles, a prevalent choice in VR-based rehabilitation due to their ease of use, enjoyment, and cost-effectiveness [63, 64]. Nevertheless, present- day researchers are increasingly avoiding these approaches as these systems are primarily designed for healthy individuals, thereby presenting signi\u0000cant challenges for patients [63]. Consequently, our study implemented an IVR system that is tailored to the speci\u0000c requirements, bene\u0000ts, and conditions of the patients. The inherent simplicity of this approach may account for the observed improvement in their FM   This simplicity aligns seamlessly with the overarching goals of stroke rehabilitation, particularly when considering early initiation to minimize the disease's impact. Given that the participants in our study were acute cases, we promptly initiated IVR in combination with PT once they were medically stable. The combination of therapies in our study, emphasizing both task-oriented exercises and repetitive movements, holds the potential to facilitate patient recovery through intensive treatment.   In IVR training, it involved task-oriented exercises, particularly actions like reaching for ball—a movement integral to activities of daily living (ADL) that frequently necessitates the use of the arm [65, 66]. Additionally, the task contained repetitive movements [67]. This approach has the potential to enhance neuroplasticity [68, 69] by facilitating the restoration of movement on the impaired side through the activation of a new motor projection region and the resting of synapses [70, 71]. As mentioned in previous studies [8, 70, 72, 73], the current focus in clinical settings is on the combined use of VR and PT for rehabilitation. These associated technologies are becoming more accessible and prevalent [74].   Nevertheless, within the domain of VR, the direct effects of VR therapy on neuroplasticity are still under investigation, and current evidence is limited [8]. However, Wang et al. [70] employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neuronal remodelling in subacute stroke patients before and after training with a Leap Motion-based VR system. They compared it to CT alone. Patients were instructed to position their affected thumb on their palm. They found that sensorimotor cortex activation moved from the ipsilateral to the contralateral region and increased in the contralateral cortex in both groups. On the Wolf motor function test, which assesses upper limb motor function, the experimental VR group had a   signi\u0000cantly greater improvement and better performance than the control group. These results demonstrate that repeated exercises with the affected arm combined with task-oriented practice in a virtual environment can enhance motor recovery of the upper limb more than CT alone. Neuroimaging research can help increase the training-dependent effects of VR and contribute to the development of VR therapies. These \u0000ndings add to the current evidence that VR therapy should not be ignored in upper limb rehabilitation, as it may have apparent advantages for patients’ recovery. More conclusive \u0000ndings to date suggest that VR can improve PT and increase the potential for rehabilitation [51, 52, 75, 76, 77].   Rather than relying solely on a single method, incorporating VR therapy into existing rehabilitation programs appears effective for enhancing stroke rehabilitation outcomes.",

According to the Associative Sequence\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nLearning (ASL) model, these imitative tendencies emerge from a link between perceptual and\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmotor representations of actions in the brain, formed through repeated sensorimotor\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nexperiences over the course of development. As a result, the perceptual representation of an\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\naction automatically activates its corresponding motor representation, leading to the tendency\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThese imitative tendencies are, in turn, thought to support successful social interaction\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nby fostering affiliation between the imitator (i.e., the person who imitates) and the imitated\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nperson (Hess & Fischer, 2013, 2022; Lakin et al., 2003). For instance, imitation has been\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfound to increase empathy (De Coster et al., 2013; Stel & Vonk, 2009) and trust (Maddux et\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nal., 2008; Over et al., 2013; Verberne et al., 2013) toward the imitator, as well as liking\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbetween the interaction partners (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999; Salazar Kämpf et al., 2018; for a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreview, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). Based on these findings, motivational theories argue\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthat imitation can be seen as a strategy to obtain social reward, such as affiliation with others\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(Stel et al., 2016; Wang & Hamilton, 2012). In line with this idea, research has shown that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nimitation increases when individuals are more motivated to affiliate with other people, for\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nexample, after being socially excluded (Lakin et al., 2008) or after being primed with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nHowever, imitation will not always lead to social reward. For example, imitating the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmovements of someone who cannot see you is unlikely to cause them to like you more\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nbecause they do not see your imitative behavior. Motivational theories incorporate these\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncontextual constraints by arguing that individuals imitate more if imitation can be expected to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nproduce social reward in that particular context (Stel et al., 2016). This implies that imitation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncan be seen as a form of operant behavior, with social reward as the reinforcer and contextual\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncues like whether the other person sees the imitator as discriminative stimuli determining if\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nimitation is likely to lead to such reward (Wang & Hamilton, 2012). Previous research\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntypically investigated this prediction by manipulating the gaze direction of a model. These\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nstudies found that a direct gaze from a model (vs. an averted gaze) not only leads to increased\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmotor activation in the brain during observation of hand movements (Prinsen et al., 2017,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n2018; Prinsen & Alaerts, 2019) but also more imitation of the model’s hand movements\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n(Wang et al., 2011; Wang & Hamilton, 2014). However, recent research, including a well-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npowered study by Carr et al. (2021), could not replicate this effect on imitation (Carr et al.,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n2021; Farmer et al., 2021). Hence, the evidence for the effect of gaze direction on imitative\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThere are two limitations in previous research that could have caused this\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ninconsistency in the literature. The first limitation is the low ecological validity of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nimitation tasks typically used to study the influence of social factors on imitation. Most\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nresearch on this topic uses the imitation-inhibition paradigm to measure automatic imitation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(Carr et al., 2021; Farmer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2011; Wang & Hamilton, 2014). In this\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntask, participants respond to symbolic cues with certain hand movements, while a hand in the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nbackground performs a congruent movement (identical to the correct response) or an\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nincongruent movement (different from the correct response) (Brass et al., 2000; Cracco,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBardi, et al., 2018). Participants tend to respond more slowly and with lower accuracy when\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe hand performs an incongruent compared to a congruent movement (Brass et al., 2000).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAlthough this congruency effect has been replicated in various studies (Cracco, Bardi, et al.,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n2018) and proven to be a reliable (Genschow et al., 2017) and valid (Cracco & Brass, 2019)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nindex of covert imitative tendencies, it is very different from how imitation typically occurs in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreal life. Whereas the imitation-inhibition task measures covert imitation of meaningless hand\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmovements on a computer screen (Brass et al., 2000; Cracco, Bardi, et al., 2018), everyday\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsituations typically involve overt imitation of meaningful social behavior. Therefore, this task\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmight be suboptimal to test the predictions by motivational theories, which focus on these\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nreal-life imitative tendencies (Stel et al., 2016; Wang & de Hamilton, 2012). Despite attempts\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto make the task more social, such as presenting a picture of a person together with the hand\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(e.g., Forbes et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2011), the imitation-inhibition imitation task remains\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nrather artificial. A possible solution to this problem is to use real-life interactions to study\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimitation (e.g., Chartrand & Bargh, 1999). However, whereas these paradigms have higher\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\necological validity, they have lower experimental control and reliability (Genschow et al.,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nBesides the limited ecological validity, a second limitation in previous work is the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nabsence of direct social comparison. In daily life, we often observe multiple individuals acting\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsimultaneously, whereas only a single hand is typically shown in each trial during imitation\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntasks. This distinction is important because, according to social judgment theories, humans\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntypically evaluate someone by comparing them to a salient reference within a specific context\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n(Mussweiler, 2003). Hence, it is possible that certain characteristics of a model influence\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimitation only when this model is compared to another model that serves as a reference. By\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npresenting only one model per trial and comparing the effect of whether this model looks at\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe participant across trials, the social comparison between both models has been merely\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nimplicit, potentially attenuating the effect of the model’s gaze direction on imitative\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntendencies. In contrast, when participants observe two models simultaneously, the fact that\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nonly one of both models looks at them becomes an important distinguishing factor between\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nTo resolve both limitations in previous work, the current study builds on a recent study\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nby Cracco et al. (2022) to investigate the effect of whether the other person sees the imitator\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\non imitation. In their study, Cracco et al. (2022) bridged the gap between the artificial\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimitation-inhibition task and more naturalistic paradigms by using virtual reality (VR). More\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nprecisely, they created an immersive VR imitation task in which they measured imitation of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsocially relevant behavior, namely gaze following. Participants were placed in a virtual city\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwith ten life-sized virtual agents. Once in a while, a sound was played, which cued\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nparticipants to look up to the left or right target window, in which a fire was burning. At the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nsame time, a variable number of virtual agents also looked up to the left or right target\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlocation. Imitation was assessed by measuring the influence of the virtual agents’ movements\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\non the participant’s behavior. Automatic imitation was measured via the congruency effect in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nforced-choice trials, identical to how it is typically measured in an imitation-inhibition task.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nHowever, because in daily life, people can typically choose their responses, and thus also\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nchoose (not) to imitate, Cracco et al. (2022) also added another measure of imitation via so-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncalled free-choice trials. In these trials, there was no correct response and participants could\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nchoose (not) to follow the virtual agents’ movements, thereby representing real-life imitative\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nCracco et al. (2022) effectively measured participants’ imitative tendencies in both\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nforced- and free-choice conditions. Moreover, they replicated findings from previous research\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nusing the typical imitation-inhibition task, by showing that automatic imitation increased with\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe number of observed movements (Cracco et al., 2015; Cracco & Brass, 2018). Altogether,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nby using VR, the researchers could increase the ecological validity of the typical imitation-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ninhibition task while also retaining experimental control (Parsons, 2015), thereby resolving\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nTo resolve the second limitation, we adapted this VR task to align with theories of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsocial judgment. First, only two agents were present during the task: one blindfolded agent\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand one agent who looked directly at the participant. By presenting both agents together in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\neach trial, we emphasized the agent’s eyesight as a distinguishing feature between them.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSecond, we included two different trial types to measure the effect of model eyesight both\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nacross and within trials. In the majority of the trials, one of both agents (i.e., the seeing or the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nblindfolded agent) looked in a certain direction, similar to the trials in Cracco et al. (2022).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBased on the predictions by motivational theories, we expected to find more imitation of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nseeing agent compared to the blindfolded agent across trials. More precisely, we expected\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nparticipants to show a stronger congruency effect for this agent (forced-choice trials) and to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nfollow this agent more frequently (free-choice trials) compared to the blindfolded agent.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nHowever, there were also trials in which both agents looked in opposite directions, which\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nallowed us to compare the effect of model eyesight within trials. When both agents move\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndifferently, the differences between both agents become essential, as participants are forced to\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nimitate either the seeing or the blindfolded agent and counter-imitate the other (for a similar\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ndesign, see De Souter et al., 2021). Therefore, these trials were added to maximize the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\neffectiveness of the model eyesight manipulation. Whereas the effect of the models’\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmovements is usually canceled out when they move differently, causing the congruency effect\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nto disappear (Cracco et al., 2015), we expected to find stronger imitative tendencies for the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nseeing agent, reflected in a congruency effect in the direction of this agent and more frequent\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.3**\nAll data and analysis code for the analyses for Experiment 1\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nOpen Science Framework (OSF).

All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were Dutch-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nspeaking, were naïve to the purpose of the experiment, and signed an informed consent before\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe start of the procedure. They were further informed that a side effect of VR is that some\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 8.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npeople get dizzy or nauseous (Pan & Hamilton, 2018). Two participants could not complete\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe VR task because they experienced dizziness during the experiment. One of these\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nparticipants did not complete the first experimental block and was therefore excluded. For the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsecond participant, we used their data for two of the four experimental blocks. After further\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nexclusions (see the Analysis section for details), the final sample consisted of 94 participants\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfor the analysis of the forced-choice trials (58 female, 33 male, 2 non-binary, 1 “rather not\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsay”, Mage = 20.36, SDage = 3.08) and 91 participants for the analysis of the free-choice trials\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n(56 female, 32 male, 2 non-binary, 1 “rather not say”, Mage = 20.41, SDage = 3.11).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe minimum sample size was determined via a power analysis with simulated data\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nusing the mixedpower package for mixed-effects models (Kumle et al., 2021). The power\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nanalysis was based on the expected effects in trials in which only one agent moved, because\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthese trials are similar to trials in the study by Cracco et al.

(2022) for the preregistered primary outcome measures\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n(i.e., reaction times (RTs) and error rates (ERs) on forced-choice trials and follow decisions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\non free-choice trials) but multiplied these effects by 75% to obtain a conservative estimate.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis corresponded to an estimated main effect of 27 ms for RTs, 4% for ERs, and 7% for the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfollow decisions. We then divided the obtained effect sizes by two to estimate the interactions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nof interest (Baranger et al., 2023). The power analysis indicated that a sample of 90\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nparticipants would allow us to detect these effects with ≥ 82% power and a significance\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nForced-Choice Trials. For trials in which one agent moved, the within-subject factors\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwere the agent’s eyesight (blindfolded, can see) and movement congruency (congruent,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nincongruent). For trials in which the two agents looked in opposite directions, the within-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsubject factor was the movement congruency of the seeing agent (congruent, incongruent).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nBecause both agents made different movements in these trials, the congruency effect for one\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nagent was always the opposite of the congruency effect for the other agent. Therefore, a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\npositive congruency effect for the seeing agent implies that this agent caused a stronger\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncongruency effect than the blindfolded agent. The primary outcome measures for these trials\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwere RTs and ERs. We included the partial errors and movement times (MTs) as secondary\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nFree-Choice Trials. For trials in which one agent moved, the within-subject factor\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwas the agent’s eyesight (blindfolded, can see). The primary measure of interest was the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nparticipant’s choice (not) to follow the moving agent. For trials in which the two agents\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nlooked in opposite directions, we simply measured whether participants followed the seeing\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nagent instead of the blindfolded agent. RTs, MTs, and partial choices were analyzed as\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nsecondary outcome measures. Figure 1 represents a visual overview of all the different trial\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nOverview of the Different Trial Types in the Design of Experiment 1\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNote. The colored boxes represent trial types. The white boxes are the different conditions\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwithin the trials. Note that there were no conditions in free-choice trials in which both agents\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe study took place in the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Ghent\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthey would perform a task together with two virtual people. These instructions explicitly\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nmentioned that one virtual person would be blindfolded during the task and were\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\naccompanied by a picture of the agents in which one of them wore the blindfold. This was\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ndone to ensure participants recognized the blindfold. After the instructions, participants put on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthe head-mounted display (HMD). We used an HTC Vive Pro HMD with built-in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nheadphones, a visual field of 110° with a resolution of 1440 x 1600 pixels per eye, and a\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nrefresh rate of 90 Hz. Next, participants completed nine practice trials of the VR experiment\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwith auditory accuracy feedback. Participants heard a “ping” sound if they provided the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ncorrect response and a “buzz” sound if they made an error. All responses were considered\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ncorrect in free-choice trials. If necessary, participants could repeat the practice phase once\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmore before proceeding to the test phase. The test phase contained 288 trials without accuracy\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfeedback, divided into four blocks with 72 trials each. All conditions were randomized within\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\neach block. The agent who wore the blindfold alternated across blocks, which means that each\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nagent wore the blindfold in two of the four blocks. Which agent wore the blindfold in the first\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nThe VR environment was constructed in Unity Engine (version 2019.4.29f), based on\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe environment used in Cracco et al. (2022). Participants stood on a street, surrounded by\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\napartment buildings. Two virtual agents, a male and a female agent, stood in front of the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nparticipant. The virtual agents and their animations were created using the Character Creator\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand iClone software from Reallusion (2022). The position of these agents (i.e., left or right)\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwas counterbalanced across participants. Both agents had a subtle smile during the task\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nbecause an entirely neutral expression could come across as not socially engaging (Wang &\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nHamilton, 2014). The buildings left and right of the participant contained a window in which\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\na fire was burning. These windows were used as target locations in the imitation task.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nFigure 2 provides an example trial of the VR task. Each trial started with a variable\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nperiod of 1500 to 3000 ms (randomized in steps of 500 ms), after which a sound was played\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nto cue the correct response. This sound was non-directional, which means that it was\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\npresented simultaneously to both ears. There were three distinct sounds used, each with a total\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nduration of one second: an explosion, a collapsing structure, and breaking glass. One sound –\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfor example, the explosion – indicated that participants had to make a head movement toward\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthe left window (forced-choice trial). The second sound – the collapsing structure – indicated\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nthat they had to look at the right window (forced-choice trial). The third sound – breaking\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nglass – indicated that participants were free to choose in which direction to look (free-choice\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ntrial). However, they were asked to balance the number of times they looked at the left versus\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nright window across trials without using an explicit strategy (e.g., switching between the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwindows on each free-choice trial) (Arrington & Logan, 2004; Vandierendonck et al., 2010).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nOne hundred to 300 ms after the start of the sound (randomized in steps of 100 ms),\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\none virtual agent (192 trials: 128 forced-choice, 64 free-choice) or both virtual agents (96\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\ntrials: 64 forced-choice, 32 free-choice) looked at one of the two target locations. If both\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nvirtual agents made a head movement, they always looked in opposite directions. In forced-\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nchoice trials, the agent(s) could look at the correct window (congruent trial) or the incorrect\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwindow (incongruent trial). In free-choice trials, there was no (in)correct response.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nParticipants could respond from the start of the auditory cue until the response deadline of\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n3000 ms. When the participant’s gaze reached one of the target windows, the fire was\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nextinguished to indicate that their response was registered. The next trial immediately started\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 12.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nwhen the participant looked back in the direction of the virtual agents.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nExample Trial in the Virtual Reality Task of Experiment 1 From Participant Viewpoint\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNote. The duration of the auditory cue was one second, which means that the sound was still\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nAfter the VR task, participants were asked to provide their demographic information\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand complete several questionnaires on a laptop. They first indicated their age and gender. To\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nindicate their gender, participants could choose one of the following options: “male”,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n“female”, “non-binary”, “not listed”, or “prefer not to say”. If they indicated that their gender\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwas “not listed”, they could fill in an alternative. Participants then completed three\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nquestionnaires, the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), the Social\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nReward Questionnaire (Foulkes et al., 2014), and the Need To Belong Scale (NTBS; Leary et\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nal., 2013), in a randomized order. These questionnaires were used for an exploratory analysis,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nfor which the materials, analysis, results, and discussion can be found in the Supplementary\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nMaterials (S1). Students who participated in return for course credit were debriefed via e-mail\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 13.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nafter data collection was finished. Participants could also share their e-mail address if they\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nCalculation of the Outcome Measures.

(2022) to calculate the participants’ RTs, ERs,\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nMTs, partial errors/choices, and the participant’s decision (not) to follow the agent(s).\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nRT was defined as the onset of the upward movement toward one of the targets. To\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\ncalculate this measure, we determined the first derivative of the HMD position on the y-axis\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\n(up/down), which represents the velocity of the upward movement at each time point. We\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nthen searched for the last time point at which this first derivative was ≤ 0 before reaching its\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nmaximum value, indicating the onset of the upward head movement. MT was defined as the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nduration of the head movement. This measure was calculated by subtracting RT (i.e., the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nonset) from the first timepoint at which the y-axis’ (up/down) first derivative was ≤ 0 again\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nafter reaching its maximum, indicating the end of the head movement.\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nPartial errors (forced-choice trials) and partial choices (free-choice trials) were trials in\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhich the participant first moved their head in the direction of one target location but then\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nchanged direction and hit the other target instead.

We then searched for a substantial deviation in the opposite direction. More\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nspecifically, if there was a five-point local minimum of <-0.05 preceding the maximum first\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nderivative value, a partial error/choice was registered. The final target was saved as the\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 14.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nParticipant and Trial Exclusion. Participant and trial exclusions were preregistered\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.2**r== 0.1**\nParticipants were excluded from all analyses if their ER on forced-choice trials was ≥\n**BLOCK**fs== 12.0**p== 15.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\n40% (none).

Because movement imitation typically only leads to these   consequences when perceived by the imitated person, it should increase when the interaction   partner sees the imitator. Current evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, potentially due to the   low ecological validity in previous studies. We conducted two experiments (Nexp1 = 94, Nexp2 =   110) in which we resolved this limitation by placing participants in a virtual environment with   a seeing and a blindfolded virtual agent, where they reacted to auditory cues with a head   movement to the left or right, while the agent(s) also made a left or right head movement. We   tested the effect of model eyesight (Experiments 1 and 2) and social reward on imitation   (Experiment 2). Data were collected in 2023 and 2024. As expected, participants tended to   imitate the agents. However, we found only limited evidence for the effect of model eyesight   on automatic imitation in Experiment 1 and no evidence for the effect of model eyesight or   social reward in Experiment 2. These findings challenge claims made by motivational   Keywords: Automatic imitation, social reward, model eyesight, motivational theories,   Motivational theories argue that humans imitate more in situations where imitation is   more likely to have positive social consequences. Based on this, it has been hypothesized that   movement imitation should be stronger when the model can see the imitator because only   then imitation can lead to a positive reaction. However, evidence for this effect has been   mixed, potentially due to the low ecological validity of previous tasks. In two experiments, we   use virtual-reality tasks to address this issue and thereby maximize the putative effect of   model eyesight. In Experiment 2, we also tested the effect of the model’s emotional reaction   to imitation. We found only limited evidence for the effect of the other person’s sight in   Experiment 1, whereas no such effect was found in Experiment 2. Furthermore, imitation was   not influenced by whether the other person (dis)liked being imitated. These findings raise   Humans have an automatic tendency to copy the behavior of others, including their   mannerisms (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999; Tschacher et al., 2014), gestures (Cracco, Genschow,   et al., 2018), facial expressions (Dimberg, 1982; Dimberg et al., 2000), and eye gaze (Cracco   et al., 2022; Driver et al., 1999; Milgram et al., 1969). According to the Associative Sequence   Learning (ASL) model, these imitative tendencies emerge from a link between perceptual and   motor representations of actions in the brain, formed through repeated sensorimotor   experiences over the course of development. As a result, the perceptual representation of an   action automatically activates its corresponding motor representation, leading to the tendency   These imitative tendencies are, in turn, thought to support successful social interaction   by fostering affiliation between the imitator (i.e., the person who imitates) and the imitated   person (Hess & Fischer, 2013, 2022; Lakin et al., 2003). For instance, imitation has been   found to increase empathy (De Coster et al., 2013; Stel & Vonk, 2009) and trust (Maddux et   al., 2008; Over et al., 2013; Verberne et al., 2013) toward the imitator, as well as liking   between the interaction partners (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999; Salazar Kämpf et al., 2018; for a   review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). Based on these findings, motivational theories argue   that imitation can be seen as a strategy to obtain social reward, such as affiliation with others   (Stel et al., 2016; Wang & Hamilton, 2012). In line with this idea, research has shown that   imitation increases when individuals are more motivated to affiliate with other people, for   example, after being socially excluded (Lakin et al., 2008) or after being primed with   However, imitation will not always lead to social reward. For example, imitating the   movements of someone who cannot see you is unlikely to cause them to like you more   because they do not see your imitative behavior. Motivational theories incorporate these   contextual constraints by arguing that individuals imitate more if imitation can be expected to   produce social reward in that particular context (Stel et al., 2016). This implies that imitation   can be seen as a form of operant behavior, with social reward as the reinforcer and contextual   cues like whether the other person sees the imitator as discriminative stimuli determining if   imitation is likely to lead to such reward (Wang & Hamilton, 2012). Previous research   typically investigated this prediction by manipulating the gaze direction of a model. These   studies found that a direct gaze from a model (vs. an averted gaze) not only leads to increased   motor activation in the brain during observation of hand movements (Prinsen et al., 2017,   2018; Prinsen & Alaerts, 2019) but also more imitation of the model’s hand movements   (Wang et al., 2011; Wang & Hamilton, 2014). However, recent research, including a well-   powered study by Carr et al. (2021), could not replicate this effect on imitation (Carr et al.,   2021; Farmer et al., 2021). Hence, the evidence for the effect of gaze direction on imitative   There are two limitations in previous research that could have caused this   inconsistency in the literature. The first limitation is the low ecological validity of the   imitation tasks typically used to study the influence of social factors on imitation. Most   research on this topic uses the imitation-inhibition paradigm to measure automatic imitation   (Carr et al., 2021; Farmer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2011; Wang & Hamilton, 2014). In this   task, participants respond to symbolic cues with certain hand movements, while a hand in the   background performs a congruent movement (identical to the correct response) or an   incongruent movement (different from the correct response) (Brass et al., 2000; Cracco,   Bardi, et al., 2018). Participants tend to respond more slowly and with lower accuracy when   the hand performs an incongruent compared to a congruent movement (Brass et al., 2000).   Although this congruency effect has been replicated in various studies (Cracco, Bardi, et al.,   2018) and proven to be a reliable (Genschow et al., 2017) and valid (Cracco & Brass, 2019)   index of covert imitative tendencies, it is very different from how imitation typically occurs in   real life. Whereas the imitation-inhibition task measures covert imitation of meaningless hand   movements on a computer screen (Brass et al., 2000; Cracco, Bardi, et al., 2018), everyday   situations typically involve overt imitation of meaningful social behavior. Therefore, this task   might be suboptimal to test the predictions by motivational theories, which focus on these   real-life imitative tendencies (Stel et al., 2016; Wang & de Hamilton, 2012). Despite attempts   to make the task more social, such as presenting a picture of a person together with the hand   (e.g., Forbes et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2011), the imitation-inhibition imitation task remains   rather artificial. A possible solution to this problem is to use real-life interactions to study   imitation (e.g., Chartrand & Bargh, 1999). However, whereas these paradigms have higher   ecological validity, they have lower experimental control and reliability (Genschow et al.,   Besides the limited ecological validity, a second limitation in previous work is the   absence of direct social comparison. In daily life, we often observe multiple individuals acting   simultaneously, whereas only a single hand is typically shown in each trial during imitation   tasks. This distinction is important because, according to social judgment theories, humans   typically evaluate someone by comparing them to a salient reference within a specific context   (Mussweiler, 2003). Hence, it is possible that certain characteristics of a model influence   imitation only when this model is compared to another model that serves as a reference. By   presenting only one model per trial and comparing the effect of whether this model looks at   the participant across trials, the social comparison between both models has been merely   implicit, potentially attenuating the effect of the model’s gaze direction on imitative   tendencies. In contrast, when participants observe two models simultaneously, the fact that   only one of both models looks at them becomes an important distinguishing factor between   To resolve both limitations in previous work, the current study builds on a recent study   by Cracco et al. (2022) to investigate the effect of whether the other person sees the imitator   on imitation. In their study, Cracco et al. (2022) bridged the gap between the artificial   imitation-inhibition task and more naturalistic paradigms by using virtual reality (VR). More   precisely, they created an immersive VR imitation task in which they measured imitation of   socially relevant behavior, namely gaze following. Participants were placed in a virtual city   with ten life-sized virtual agents. Once in a while, a sound was played, which cued   participants to look up to the left or right target window, in which a fire was burning. At the   same time, a variable number of virtual agents also looked up to the left or right target   location. Imitation was assessed by measuring the influence of the virtual agents’ movements   on the participant’s behavior. Automatic imitation was measured via the congruency effect in   forced-choice trials, identical to how it is typically measured in an imitation-inhibition task.   However, because in daily life, people can typically choose their responses, and thus also   choose (not) to imitate, Cracco et al. (2022) also added another measure of imitation via so-   called free-choice trials. In these trials, there was no correct response and participants could   choose (not) to follow the virtual agents’ movements, thereby representing real-life imitative   Cracco et al. (2022) effectively measured participants’ imitative tendencies in both   forced- and free-choice conditions. Moreover, they replicated findings from previous research   using the typical imitation-inhibition task, by showing that automatic imitation increased with   the number of observed movements (Cracco et al., 2015; Cracco & Brass, 2018). Altogether,   by using VR, the researchers could increase the ecological validity of the typical imitation-   inhibition task while also retaining experimental control (Parsons, 2015), thereby resolving   To resolve the second limitation, we adapted this VR task to align with theories of   social judgment. First, only two agents were present during the task: one blindfolded agent   and one agent who looked directly at the participant. By presenting both agents together in   each trial, we emphasized the agent’s eyesight as a distinguishing feature between them.   Second, we included two different trial types to measure the effect of model eyesight both   across and within trials. In the majority of the trials, one of both agents (i.e., the seeing or the   blindfolded agent) looked in a certain direction, similar to the trials in Cracco et al. (2022).   Based on the predictions by motivational theories, we expected to find more imitation of the   seeing agent compared to the blindfolded agent across trials. More precisely, we expected   participants to show a stronger congruency effect for this agent (forced-choice trials) and to   follow this agent more frequently (free-choice trials) compared to the blindfolded agent.   However, there were also trials in which both agents looked in opposite directions, which   allowed us to compare the effect of model eyesight within trials. When both agents move   differently, the differences between both agents become essential, as participants are forced to   imitate either the seeing or the blindfolded agent and counter-imitate the other (for a similar   design, see De Souter et al., 2021). Therefore, these trials were added to maximize the   effectiveness of the model eyesight manipulation. Whereas the effect of the models’   movements is usually canceled out when they move differently, causing the congruency effect   to disappear (Cracco et al., 2015), we expected to find stronger imitative tendencies for the   seeing agent, reflected in a congruency effect in the direction of this agent and more frequent   All data and analysis code for the analyses for Experiment 1   Open Science Framework (OSF).

The experiments’ designs, hypotheses, and   both experiments, there were no departures from the preregistered plan for the confirmatory   analyses, and analyses that were not preregistered are identified as exploratory. Both   experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Psychology and   Participants were recruited through the research participation system of Ghent   University (Sona Systems) and social media posts. Data for this study were collected in 2023.   Ninety-eight participants took part in this study in return for course credit or €10. Participants   who took part in return for course credit (N = 77) were first-year psychology students at   Ghent University. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were Dutch-   speaking, were naïve to the purpose of the experiment, and signed an informed consent before   the start of the procedure. They were further informed that a side effect of VR is that some   people get dizzy or nauseous (Pan & Hamilton, 2018). Two participants could not complete   the VR task because they experienced dizziness during the experiment. One of these   participants did not complete the first experimental block and was therefore excluded. For the   second participant, we used their data for two of the four experimental blocks. After further   exclusions (see the Analysis section for details), the final sample consisted of 94 participants   for the analysis of the forced-choice trials (58 female, 33 male, 2 non-binary, 1 “rather not   say”, Mage = 20.36, SDage = 3.08) and 91 participants for the analysis of the free-choice trials   (56 female, 32 male, 2 non-binary, 1 “rather not say”, Mage = 20.41, SDage = 3.11).   The minimum sample size was determined via a power analysis with simulated data   using the mixedpower package for mixed-effects models (Kumle et al., 2021). The power   analysis was based on the expected effects in trials in which only one agent moved, because   these trials are similar to trials in the study by Cracco et al. (2022). We aimed to detect the   same main effects as Cracco et al. (2022) for the preregistered primary outcome measures   (i.e., reaction times (RTs) and error rates (ERs) on forced-choice trials and follow decisions   on free-choice trials) but multiplied these effects by 75% to obtain a conservative estimate.   This corresponded to an estimated main effect of 27 ms for RTs, 4% for ERs, and 7% for the   follow decisions. We then divided the obtained effect sizes by two to estimate the interactions   of interest (Baranger et al., 2023). The power analysis indicated that a sample of 90   participants would allow us to detect these effects with ≥ 82% power and a significance   Forced-Choice Trials. For trials in which one agent moved, the within-subject factors   were the agent’s eyesight (blindfolded, can see) and movement congruency (congruent,   incongruent). For trials in which the two agents looked in opposite directions, the within-   subject factor was the movement congruency of the seeing agent (congruent, incongruent).   Because both agents made different movements in these trials, the congruency effect for one   agent was always the opposite of the congruency effect for the other agent. Therefore, a   positive congruency effect for the seeing agent implies that this agent caused a stronger   congruency effect than the blindfolded agent. The primary outcome measures for these trials   were RTs and ERs. We included the partial errors and movement times (MTs) as secondary   Free-Choice Trials. For trials in which one agent moved, the within-subject factor   was the agent’s eyesight (blindfolded, can see). The primary measure of interest was the   participant’s choice (not) to follow the moving agent. For trials in which the two agents   looked in opposite directions, we simply measured whether participants followed the seeing   agent instead of the blindfolded agent. RTs, MTs, and partial choices were analyzed as   secondary outcome measures.

These instructions explicitly   mentioned that one virtual person would be blindfolded during the task and were   accompanied by a picture of the agents in which one of them wore the blindfold. This was   done to ensure participants recognized the blindfold. After the instructions, participants put on   the head-mounted display (HMD). We used an HTC Vive Pro HMD with built-in   headphones, a visual field of 110° with a resolution of 1440 x 1600 pixels per eye, and a   refresh rate of 90 Hz. Next, participants completed nine practice trials of the VR experiment   with auditory accuracy feedback. Participants heard a “ping” sound if they provided the   correct response and a “buzz” sound if they made an error. All responses were considered   correct in free-choice trials. If necessary, participants could repeat the practice phase once   more before proceeding to the test phase. The test phase contained 288 trials without accuracy   feedback, divided into four blocks with 72 trials each. All conditions were randomized within   each block. The agent who wore the blindfold alternated across blocks, which means that each   agent wore the blindfold in two of the four blocks. Which agent wore the blindfold in the first   The VR environment was constructed in Unity Engine (version 2019.4.29f), based on   the environment used in Cracco et al. (2022). Participants stood on a street, surrounded by   apartment buildings. Two virtual agents, a male and a female agent, stood in front of the   participant. The virtual agents and their animations were created using the Character Creator   and iClone software from Reallusion (2022). The position of these agents (i.e., left or right)   was counterbalanced across participants. Both agents had a subtle smile during the task   because an entirely neutral expression could come across as not socially engaging (Wang &   Hamilton, 2014). The buildings left and right of the participant contained a window in which   a fire was burning. These windows were used as target locations in the imitation task.   Figure 2 provides an example trial of the VR task. Each trial started with a variable   period of 1500 to 3000 ms (randomized in steps of 500 ms), after which a sound was played   to cue the correct response. This sound was non-directional, which means that it was   presented simultaneously to both ears. There were three distinct sounds used, each with a total   duration of one second: an explosion, a collapsing structure, and breaking glass. One sound –   for example, the explosion – indicated that participants had to make a head movement toward   the left window (forced-choice trial). The second sound – the collapsing structure – indicated   that they had to look at the right window (forced-choice trial). The third sound – breaking   glass – indicated that participants were free to choose in which direction to look (free-choice   trial). However, they were asked to balance the number of times they looked at the left versus   right window across trials without using an explicit strategy (e.g., switching between the   windows on each free-choice trial) (Arrington & Logan, 2004; Vandierendonck et al., 2010).   One hundred to 300 ms after the start of the sound (randomized in steps of 100 ms),   one virtual agent (192 trials: 128 forced-choice, 64 free-choice) or both virtual agents (96   trials: 64 forced-choice, 32 free-choice) looked at one of the two target locations. If both   virtual agents made a head movement, they always looked in opposite directions. In forced-   choice trials, the agent(s) could look at the correct window (congruent trial) or the incorrect   window (incongruent trial). In free-choice trials, there was no (in)correct response.   Participants could respond from the start of the auditory cue until the response deadline of   3000 ms. When the participant’s gaze reached one of the target windows, the fire was   extinguished to indicate that their response was registered. The next trial immediately started   when the participant looked back in the direction of the virtual agents.   Example Trial in the Virtual Reality Task of Experiment 1 From Participant Viewpoint   Note. The duration of the auditory cue was one second, which means that the sound was still   After the VR task, participants were asked to provide their demographic information   and complete several questionnaires on a laptop. They first indicated their age and gender. To   indicate their gender, participants could choose one of the following options: “male”,   “female”, “non-binary”, “not listed”, or “prefer not to say”. If they indicated that their gender   was “not listed”, they could fill in an alternative. Participants then completed three   questionnaires, the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), the Social   Reward Questionnaire (Foulkes et al., 2014), and the Need To Belong Scale (NTBS; Leary et   al., 2013), in a randomized order. These questionnaires were used for an exploratory analysis,   for which the materials, analysis, results, and discussion can be found in the Supplementary   Materials (S1). Students who participated in return for course credit were debriefed via e-mail   after data collection was finished. Participants could also share their e-mail address if they   Calculation of the Outcome Measures. The x, y, and z coordinates of the HMD were   continuously tracked throughout the experiment to measure the precise onset and direction of   the participant’s head movement together with the moment they reached the target location.   We followed the procedure from Cracco et al. (2022) to calculate the participants’ RTs, ERs,   MTs, partial errors/choices, and the participant’s decision (not) to follow the agent(s).   RT was defined as the onset of the upward movement toward one of the targets. To   calculate this measure, we determined the first derivative of the HMD position on the y-axis   (up/down), which represents the velocity of the upward movement at each time point. We   then searched for the last time point at which this first derivative was ≤ 0 before reaching its   maximum value, indicating the onset of the upward head movement. MT was defined as the   duration of the head movement. This measure was calculated by subtracting RT (i.e., the   onset) from the first timepoint at which the y-axis’ (up/down) first derivative was ≤ 0 again   after reaching its maximum, indicating the end of the head movement.   Partial errors (forced-choice trials) and partial choices (free-choice trials) were trials in   which the participant first moved their head in the direction of one target location but then   changed direction and hit the other target instead. Partial errors/choices were calculated by   taking the first derivative of the HMD position on the z-axis (left/right) and recoding the   obtained values such that values reflected a movement in the direction of the participant’s   final target. We then searched for a substantial deviation in the opposite direction. More   specifically, if there was a five-point local minimum of <-0.05 preceding the maximum first   derivative value, a partial error/choice was registered. The final target was saved as the   Participant and Trial Exclusion. Participant and trial exclusions were preregistered   Participants were excluded from all analyses if their ER on forced-choice trials was ≥   40% (none). Three participants were excluded from the forced-choice analysis because their   ER exceeded the average ER in the sample with ≥ 2.5 SD or because their mean RT on   forced-choice trials was ≥ 2.5 SD above or below the mean RT in the sample. Six participants   were excluded from the free-choice analysis because they chose the same target on ≥ 75% of   the trials or because their mean RT on free-choice trials was ≥ 2.5 SD above or below the   mean RT in the sample. Ninety-four participants (58 female, 33 male, 2 non-binary, 1 “rather   not say”, Mage = 20.36, SDage = 3.08) were included in the forced-choice analysis and 91   participants (56 female, 32 male, 2 non-binary, 1 “rather not say”, Mage = 20.41, SDage = 3.11)   Trials were excluded from all analyses if the RT was ≤ 200 ms (0.45%), if the RT was   ≥ 4000 ms (0.00%), or if the MT was ≥ 2000 ms (0.01%). In addition, trials were excluded   from the forced-choice RT/MT analysis if the response was incorrect (1.71%) or if a partial   error was made (8.59%). In the RT/MT analysis, trials were also excluded if the RT was ≥ 2.5   SD above or below the participant’s mean RT (1.97%) or if the MT was ≥ 2.5 SD above or   below the participant’s mean MT (1.92%). The same criteria were used in the partial error   analysis, except that partial errors were included, and in the forced-choice ER analysis, except   that the errors were included. Trials were excluded in the error (3.10%) and partial error   (4.08%) analyses if the RT and/or MT was ≥ 2.5 SD above or below the participant’s mean   Apart from the trials that were excluded from all analyses, trials were also excluded   from the free-choice RT/MT/participant’s decision analysis if a partial choice was made   (7.63%), if the RT was ≥ 2.5 SD above or below the participant’s mean RT (1.76%) or if the   MT was ≥ 2.5 SD above or below the participant’s mean MT (1.71%) on free-choice trials   without partial choices. The same criteria were used for trial exclusion in the partial choice   analysis, except that partial choices were included. In this analysis, 3.54% of the trials were   excluded because the RT and/or MT was ≥ 2.5 SD above or below the participant’s mean   Preregistered Data Analysis. RTs and MTs were analyzed with linear mixed-effects   models (Bates et al., 2015) and p-values were calculated using the Satterthwaite correction for   Kuznetsova et al., 2017). As a measure of effect size, we report the beta estimates and their   95% confidence interval. ERs, partial errors, partial choices, and the participant’s decision   were analyzed with generalized mixed-effects models, using the binomial logit link function   (Baayen et al., 2008; Bates et al., 2015). P-values were calculated using Wald Chi-Square   tests for generalized mixed-effects models. We report the unsigned z-values and add the odds   ratios and their 95% confidence interval as a measure of effect size. Type three sum of   squares and contrast coding were used in all analyses. The random-effects structure of the   models was determined through the procedure suggested by Scandola and Tidoni (2024) to   balance type I and type II errors. This procedure fits complex random intercepts rather than   random slopes, which allows us to fit more complex models without convergency or   singularity issues (i.e., the statistical procedure fails to fit an optimal model with the given   Models in Forced-Choice Trials.

Note that,   numerically, this effect showed faster MTs for incongruent (M = 635 ms, SD = 143 ms)   compared to congruent movements (M = 640 ms, SD = 146 ms), a pattern opposite to the   significant congruency effects found in our primary outcome measures.

The analysis of partial errors revealed a   significant effect of congruency, z = 8.45, p < .001, OR = 1.45, 95% CI [1.33, 1.58].   Participants made more partial errors when the moving agent made incongruent (M = 11.09%,   SD = 9.10%) compared to congruent movements (M = 5.68%, SD = 4.93%). We further found   a significant main effect of the agent’s sight, z = 2.25, p = .025, OR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.86,   0.99], with more partial errors when the agent was blindfolded (M = 8.93%, SD = 6.95%) than   when the agent could see (M = 7.84%, SD = 6.46%). In line with previous outcome measures,   the interaction between the agent’s congruency and sight was non-significant, z = 0.50, p =   The Participant’s Decision on Free-Choice Trials.  The analysis of the participants’   decision (not) to follow the moving agent (Figure 3C) revealed a significant intercept, z =   7.69, p < .001, OR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.24, 1.43]. Participants followed the moving agent in   57.02% (SD = 8.52%) of the trials, which is significantly more than the chance level.

         "The increasing integration of automation technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and machine learning, is transforming industries, enhancing efficiency, and reshaping human-automation interaction (HAI). While these technologies offer significant advantages in sectors like healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing, their seamless integration requires careful consideration of safety, reliability, ethical concerns, and human oversight. The challenge lies in balancing machine autonomy and human involvement to foster trust, mitigate risks, and ensure ethical deployment.\n\nThis paper explores the evolution of HAI, tracing its development from early mechanical automation in the Industrial Revolution to modern autonomous systems. Key aspects of HAI, including safety concerns, ethical dilemmas, cognitive load, divided attention, and human-robot collaboration, are analyzed. Furthermore, the role of human oversight in decision-making and risk mitigation is discussed. As automation continues to advance, understanding these dynamics is crucial for ensuring smooth and ethical integration into society. Future developments in AI-driven automation, human-robot collaboration, and autonomous systems will be pivotal in addressing current challenges and optimizing human-automation synergy.\n\nKeywords: Human-Automation Interaction (HAI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, Machine Learning, Automation, Human-Robot Collaboration, Safety, Ethics, Trust, Cognitive Load, Risk Mitigation, Human Oversight, Decision-Making, Autonomous Systems, Industrial Revolution, Future of Automation.",

Introduction\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.2**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.3**r== 0.1**\nWe review the history of human-automation interaction research, assess its current status and identify future\ndirections. We start by reviewing articles that were published on this topic in the International Journal of\nHuman-Computer Studies during the last 50 years. We ﬁnd that over the years, automated systems have been\nused more frequently (1) in time-sensitive or safety-critical settings, (2) in embodied and situated systems, and\n(3) by non-professional users. Looking to the future, there is a need for human-automation interaction research\nto focus on (1) issues of function and task allocation between humans and machines, (2) issues of trust, incorrect\nuse, and confusion, (3) the balance between focus, divided attention and attention management, (4) the need for\ninterdisciplinary approaches to cover breadth and depth, (5) regulation and explainability, (6) ethical and social\ndilemmas, (7) allowing a human and humane experience, and (8) radically diﬀerent human-automation inter-\naction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe concepts of automation, and mechanized and automated work\nhave been around for decades. According to the Britannica en-\ncyclopedia, automation is “the application of machines to tasks once\nperformed by human beings or, increasingly, to tasks that would otherwise be\nimpossible. Although the term mechanization is often used to refer to the\nsimple replacement of human labour by machines, automation generally\ninto a self-governing system.”\nimplies\n(Groover, 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nthe integration of machines\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe above deﬁnition of automation does not involve the require-\nment of a computer processor. However, many modern forms of auto-\nmated (or sometimes: autonomous) machines, such as power plant\nmonitoring devices, automated cars, drones, robots, and chatbots, do\ninvolve computers. These computer-automated systems are used by\nhumans, and humans are expected to remain essential contributors to\nartiﬁcial systems and automated systems in the future (Stone et al.,\n2016). The study of human-computer interaction, or more speciﬁcally\nhuman-automation interaction, therefore continues to remain relevant\nas automated systems are used to support more and more everyday\nactivities, overseen by non-technical and non-professional end-users.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nIn this special\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nissue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the\nInternational Journal of Human-Computer Studies, and its predecessor\nthe International Journal of Man-Machine Studies (from now on\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncollectively referred to as IJHCS), we review the contributions that\nIJHCS has made towards the study of human-automation interaction.\nWe therefore analyze published work from the journal to distill historic\ntrends. Our analysis shows that human-automation interaction is a ﬁeld\nthat keeps expanding into new domains and contexts (what we refer to\nas “breadth”), and also keeps improving its performance within do-\nmains and contexts (what we refer to as “depth”). Given these expan-\nsions, and the exposure to more contexts and to a wider and more di-\nverse group of end-users, there is a potential for the broader human-\ncomputer interaction community to contribute skills and knowledge to\ncreate and evaluate safe, engaging, and productive automated systems.\nWe close our analysis by discussing eight trends that we deem of\nparticular relevance for this community, classiﬁed in two segments.\nFirst, we discuss trends that have been around for a while but continue\nto remain important: (1) function and task allocation between humans\nand machines, (2) trust, incorrect use, and confusion, and (3) the bal-\nance between focus, divided attention and attention management.\nThen, we discuss emerging themes: (4) the need for interdisciplinary\napproaches to cover breadth and depth, (5) regulation and explain-\nability, (6) ethical and social dilemmas, (7) allowing a human and\nhumane experience, and (8) radically diﬀerent human-automation in-\nteraction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.2**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nCorresponding author.\nE-mail address: c.p.janssen@uu.nl (C.P.

History of human-automation interaction\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo gain an overview of the number of articles that were published\non the topic of human-automation interaction in IJHCS over its 50 year\nexistence, we conducted a Scopus search on January 14th 2019. We\ncollected all articles that had the word “automation”, “automated”, or\n“autonomous” in either the title, abstract, or keywords. Table 1 reports\nthe number of articles that matched the search query per topic and\ndecade, together with the total number of articles that was published in\nIJHCS that decade.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe topic of automation covers a substantial subset of the published\nwork in IJHCS: 4–11% of published articles in each decade, with\naround 5–6% of the articles in the last two decades. These percentages\nshould be interpreted as approximate values, as the count is limited by\nthe keywords that authors used in their paper's title, abstract and\nkeywords section. There might be false alarms (papers that were re-\nturned based on keywords, but that did not directly address research on\nhuman-automation interaction) and misses (papers that are relevant for\nthe ﬁeld of human-automation interaction, but did not include these\nspeciﬁc keywords).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTo gain a richer understanding of the themes that are discussed in\nIJHCS papers on human-automation interaction, our initial keyword\nsearch was followed by a qualitative analysis. For this analysis, we\nsorted the IJHCS papers on human-automation interaction by year of\npublication. We then read the titles and abstracts of these papers to pick\nup common themes per decade. This revealed four themes which align\nwell with more general trends in artiﬁcial intelligence (e.g., Russell and\nNorvig, 2009, chapter 1) and human-computer interaction (e.g.,\nCarroll, 2013). However, as the analysis method is subjective in nature,\nand limited by the papers that were published in IJHCS, we do not\nclaim that we have identiﬁed all strands of human-automation inter-\naction research that occurred over the last ﬁve decades. We do claim\nthat we identiﬁed relevant themes, which are discussed in more detail\nnext.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n2.1. Start: automation for dedicated domains\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nPublications on automation in IJHCS largely started oﬀ with the\nstudy of dedicated, domain speciﬁc systems. In the 1970s and 1980s a\nlarge proportion of published work (around 25 papers) focused speci-\nﬁcally on the development and evaluation of automated psychological\ntests (for overview papers, see e.g. Elithorn et al., 1982; Thompson and\nWilson, 1982). The widespread introduction of computers allowed\npsychology researchers to conduct interactive tasks on computers, in-\nstead of just pen-and-paper tests or subjective assessment. Nowadays,\ndigital testing is common in experimental studies involving human\nparticipants, and has given rise to opportunities for conducting large-\nscale studies using crowdsourcing platforms, like Amazon's Mechanical\nTurk (see Gould et al., 2018 for a review). Given the rise and ubiquity of\npersonal computing devices, the idea of completing an online survey\nwould now hardly qualify as an example of “automation” anymore.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nA second dedicated domain in which automation was researched is\nknowledge acquisition (Feigenbaum, 1977). As reviewed in a previous\nIJHCS special issue (Motta, 2013), one of the main aims within this\ndomain in the 1980s was to be able to develop methods to ‘extract’\nknowledge from experts that can be represented in machines. Among\nour dataset of papers on automation, the top-cited papers from the\n1980s all proposed methods for knowledge elicitation (e.g., Belkin\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\net al., 1987; Diederich et al., 1987; Gruber and Cohen, 1987). Since the\n1980s there has been a general shift in perspective that successful\nknowledge acquisition and knowledge engineering requires more than\nextracting knowledge. Considerations of systems engineering and al-\nlowing smart inferences based on multiple sources (e.g., through the\ninternet) are now seen to be key, with modern day knowledge acqui-\nsition research taking on a broad and multi-disciplinary perspective\n(see also Motta, 2013; Gaines, 2013; Breuker, 2013).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n2.2. Time-sensitive and safety-critical settings\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThroughout the last ﬁve decades of IJHCS, automation research has\nbranched out into more domains and settings. One distinct class of re-\nsearch is on tasks that are time-sensitive (i.e., require a response within\na ﬁnite, short time interval) and/or safety-critical (i.e., where an in-\ncorrect action can have disastrous consequences). Work in this area has\nbeen published in every decade, but particularly in the 1990s and early\n2000s. The range of settings in which time-sensitive and safety-critical\ntasks have been studied is diverse and varied: from monitoring dynamic\nprocesses in factories (e.g., Lee and Moray, 1994), power plants (e.g.,\nVicente et al., 2001), and other professional settings (e.g., Bahner et al.,\n2008; van Gigh, 1971), to ﬂight monitoring (e.g., Singh et al., 1997;\nSkitka et al., 1999, 2000), and semi-automated driving (e.g., Rajaonah\net al., 2008, Seppelt and Lee, 2007).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe diversity of domains (and the importance of preventing in-\ncidents) has allowed an exploration of deep general topics throughout\nthe history of IJHCS, which remain relevant for today's research. They\ninclude topics such as how to distribute or allocate tasks between hu-\nmans and machines (Dearden et al., 2000; Hollnagel and Bye, 2000;\nPress, 1971; Sheridan, 2000; de Vries et al., 2003; Milewski and Lewis,\n1997), ﬁnding the right levels of workload to avoid under- and overload\n(Van Gigh, 1971; Rajaonah et al., 2008), how to promote appropriate\nlevels of trust in automation (Dzindolet et al., 2003; Lee and Moray,\n1994), and how to avoid incorrect use and (human) errors such as\nthrough complacency (Bahner et al., 2008) or (human) biases (Skitka\net al., 1999, 2000). We will return to the current status of these topics in\nmore detail in our section on the future of human-automation inter-\naction.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n2.3. Embodied, situated agents\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nSince the 1990s there has been a gradual shift away from static\nsystems for speciﬁc domains (e.g., expert systems, systems for psycho-\nlogical testing) to systems that involve a dynamic intelligent agent that\nperforms a task (e.g., Milewski and Lewis, 1997; Zeng and Sycara,\n1998). This continues in the 2000s, with a rise of papers on automated\nsystems that act in a dynamic, physical world. This parallels the po-\npularization in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) research of embodied, si-\ntuated agents (Pfeifer and Scheier, 2001): systems that have their own\nsensors and that depend on interaction with the environment for per-\nformance. For example, in the 2000s IJHCS published various studies\non physical robots (e.g., Kaber et al., 2006; Sakamoto et al., 2005) and\ncars (Rajaonah et al., 2008; Seppelt and Lee, 2007). In parallel, there is\nalso research published on aﬀective interaction with robots, and auto-\nmated (emotion) feature detection (e.g., Bailenson et al., 2008; Brave\net al., 2005; Partala and Surakka, 2003). These topics continue in the\n2010s, but also broaden out to include, for example, research on\nhuman-robot interaction with multiple robots (Chien et al., 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe relevance of considering embodied and situated robotics and\nautomation explicitly is that the actions of embodied, situated systems\n(at least in part) depend on how the world is perceived through the\nmachine's sensors, and through the environment in which the machine\ninteracts (Pfeifer and Scheier, 2001). Diﬀerent machines can (learn to)\nact diﬀerently if either their sensors have diﬀerent capabilities or if they\nare trained in diﬀerent kinds of environments.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\nthese embodied,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nGeneralization to unknown settings, and adaptation to new settings,\nrequires extensive training for\nsituated robots.\nAutomated vehicles are an example of an embodied, situated robot that\nacts in and adapts to unknown settings. For automated vehicles,\ntraining typically consists of a combination of extensive experience\nunder real-world driving conditions, as well as extensive simulated\ntraining sessions to learn how to act\nin other potential worlds\n(Madrigal, 2017). By contrast, earlier simpler automated systems, such\nas, closed-world factory systems, or virtual systems such as a digital\npsychological test or expert system, require relatively less extensive\ntesting due to their reliance on the assumptions of a closed world.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n2.4. Rise of the non-professional users\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs chips get smaller and gain more capacity, smart and automated\ntechnology is becoming more widely available for use by non-profes-\nsional users. These users have often not been trained in how to use or\noperate the system and often do not have a detailed technical under-\nstanding of how the automation works and the limitations on its suc-\ncessful operation. The last trend that we observe is then that there has\nbeen an increase in research on automation for use outside of profes-\nsional settings. For example, the availability of smart phones and other\nsmart devices that are connected to the internet and allow users to\ninteract with automated systems and processes. Some examples that are\ncovered in IJHCS include electronic shopping (e.g., Hassanein and\nHead, 2007), robots as social companions (e.g., Leite et al., 2013), and\ncontrol of semi-automated vehicles (e.g., Rajaonah et al., 2008; Seppelt\nand Lee, 2007).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nWhile many of the topics that apply to professional (skilled) users of\nautomated systems also apply to non-professional users, there are some\nadditional considerations that come into play for research on how non-\nprofessional users interact with automated systems. For example, for\nnon-professional users one cannot rely on extensive training and ex-\nperience with the technology, and the technology might be used in a\nwider set of context than that which can be predicted by the profession.\nStudy of use by non-professional users is therefore an emerging setting,\ndiscussed in more detail below that requires the full breadth of HCI\nexpertise. Moreover, the use by non-professional users requires further\nconsideration of more ethical topics such as human attitudes towards\nand acceptance of autonomous systems (Złotowski et al., 2017) and\nhow to handle security and hacking (Chen et al., 2018; Ferreira and\nTeles, 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n2.5. Summary of human-automation interaction research to date\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn summary, our analysis of publications in IJHCS on the topic of\nhuman-automation interaction shows that research has expanded be-\nyond the use of automation in dedicated domains such as factory as-\nsembly lines and automated psychological tests. In particular, there are\ndistinct research lines that investigate the use of automation in time-\nsensitive or safety-critical settings, through embodied situated agents,\nand by non-professional users.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFig. 1 provides a Venn diagram with examples of automated systems\nfor each of these research lines. The Venn diagram also makes explicit\nhow these diﬀerent areas ﬁt together. Speciﬁcally, it identiﬁes that\nthere are many domains and settings in which two or more of these\nresearch lines come together. A prime example is the automated car,\nwhich involves automation in the form of an embodied, situated agent,\nwhich is used by non-professional users in a time-sensitive, safety-\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.9**r== 0.1**\nPfeifer\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.8**r== 0.2**\nagents,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nsituated\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.7**r== 0.3**\nembodied\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.6**r== 0.4**\nconsidered\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nFor embodied, situated systems some form of automation (or au-\ntonomy) is almost always required (although by deﬁnition, humans can\nalso\nand\nScheier, 2001). Hence in our Venn Diagram of Fig. 1, embodied, si-\ntuated agents are represented as a subset of the larger automation ca-\ntegory. Moreover, whether something is considered embodied and si-\ntuated might at times be open to interpretation. For example, we opted\nthat a power plant monitoring system is not labeled as embodied and\nsituated, even though such systems can sense and act to maintain a\nbalance in the power plant's processes (e.g.,\nincrease or decrease\ncooling). Our motivation for not including it as a fully embodied, si-\ntuated agent was that—from our understanding—these systems tend to\nrely on if-then rules and are less open to dynamic situations that our\nother examples (e.g., cars and military drones) face.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n3. Future of human-automation interaction: evergreen themes\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nWe now turn our attention to the future of human-automation in-\nteraction research, by describing themes that are important for future\nwork. We start by describing three themes that are “evergreens”:\nthemes that were also covered in the past, but that continue to be im-\nportant areas for research. In particular, these themes require further\nexpansion due to the breadth of domains and users that are involved in\nautomated settings. After discussing these evergreen topics, we go on to\ndiscuss ﬁve new topics in human-automation interaction that we expect\nto increase in importance over the coming years.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n3.1. Function and task allocation between humans and machines\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe ﬁrst theme that has had persistent attention in IJHCS research\non automation is the distribution or allocation of tasks between humans\nand automated systems (e.g., Dearden et al., 2000; Hollnagel and Bye,\n2000; Press, 1971; Sheridan, 2000; de Vries et al., 2003; Milewski and\nLewis, 1997). A simple, naive understanding of the introduction of\nautomation might be that automated systems take over the execution of\ntasks from humans, and thereby simply ‘reduce’ the amount of work or\nattention that humans need to dedicate to that task. A colloquial un-\nderstanding is for example that people are better at some tasks (e.g., to\nexercise judgment) and machines are better at other tasks (e.g., to\nperform repetitive routine tasks; Fitts, 1951). However, as analyzed in\ndetail by Sheridan (2000), achieving such allocation in practice is a\nhard problem, as researchers diﬀer in what they set as appropriate\ncriteria for the function allocation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn line with this view, it is important to consider the so-called “irony\nof automation” (Bainbridge, 1983), which states that introduction of\nautomation can radically change how people perceive or act in a spe-\nciﬁc context. People do not merely reduce what they work on when\n(part of) a task is automated, but use diﬀerent strategies for working on\nthat task altogether. For example, one intention of semi-automated\nvehicles is that the human driver is responsible for fewer basic control-\nmonitoring tasks (e.g., steering, pressing the gas), and can therefore\nswitch his or her attention to monitoring the traﬃc environment and\nthe vehicle. However, a meta-review of research on driving assistance\nsystems suggests that the introduction of automation increases the\nlikelihood that drivers perform non-driving related tasks, which reduces\ntheir situational awareness and response time to alerts (de Winter et al.,\n2014).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 2.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAlthough the problem of function allocation, and related themes,\nsuch as the irony of automation, have been known for decades, the\nassociated research questions gain new urgency now that automation is\nbeing used by non-professional users in time-sensitive and safety-cri-\ntical contexts. An underestimation of user interaction in these domains\ncan lead to incidents, and non-professional users might lack the training\nand experience to cope with system failures. Moreover, they might\nunderestimate risks or misplace their trust in the system. For example,\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.2**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFig. 1. Venn Diagram of current types of human-automation interaction research (not to scale). Automated systems are developed for use by non-professional users,\nin time-sensitive or safety-critical systems. Embodied situated systems are a subset of automated systems that have seen a rise since the early 2000s.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nin the ﬁrst deadly incident with a Tesla model S (a partially automated\nvehicle), the human driver had a prolonged period of visual distraction\nshortly before the crash (Habib, 2017). Although the cause of this\ndistraction is unknown, misplaced trust in the automation might have\nbeen a factor.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAutomation might also change how, when, and where tasks are\nperformed. For example, if cars become more automated, will they turn\ninto mobile oﬃces (Chuang et al., 2018), or areas of fun and play\n(Kun et al., 2016)? That is, automation might be a radical disruptive\ninnovation that changes more than just the task itself.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\n3.2. Trust, incorrect use, and confusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe second major theme of human-automation interaction to have\nreceived persistent attention in IJHCS over the years is how to promote\nappropriate levels of trust in automation (Dzindolet et al., 2003; Lee\nand Moray, 1994), how to avoid incorrect use and (human) errors (e.g.,\nBahner et al., 2008; Skitka et al., 1999, 2000), and how to avoid con-\nfusion.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nParasuraman and Riley (1997) introduced four distinct types of use\nof automation that can impact a user's trust in a system. Initial use\nmight already depend on trust, but on top of that users and other sta-\nkeholders of automation might misuse the automation (i.e., show\noverreliance, or too much trust), disuse it (i.e., under rely on the auto-\nmation and distrust it, for example due to false alarms), or abuse it (i.e.,\nintroducing the automation without considering all the consequences of\nit, in line with the irony of automation, Bainbridge, 1983). These four\nforms of use, and their impact on trust are still relevant today. They are\nparticularly relevant now that non-professional users are using auto-\nmation in more settings. As they lack the training and experience of\nprofessional users, they might bring in incorrect expectations of the\ncapabilities of the automated system, resulting in misuse or disuse.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHow a user uses automation, and how they perceive trust can also\nbe looked at more dynamically, based on a user's understanding of the\nsystem's mode of operation over time. The mode, or state, of an auto-\nmated system determines its response to user input and to changes in\nthe overall context of the system. For example, in automated vehicles,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncruise control and adaptive cruise control can be two automation\nmodes. When human drivers or operators engage adaptive cruise con-\ntrol, their vehicle will attempt to maintain a given speed, but will slow\ndown if there is slower traﬃc ahead; in contrast the same vehicle with\n(non-adaptive) cruise control will not slow down for slower vehicles\nahead. The human operator needs to keep track of mode changes, and\nalso remember how the system will react to user input and context\nchanges in the current mode. Mode confusion (mode error) occurs when\nthe human operator is confused about the current mode of the system,\nor cannot remember how the system will react in the current mode\n(Sarter and Woods, 1992).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nMode confusion is highly consequential for safety-critical systems,\nsuch as road vehicles, power plants, airplanes, robotic wheelchairs, and\nﬂight control systems. In the above example, if the driver mistakenly\nbelieves that the vehicle is in the adaptive cruise control mode, when it\nis actually in (non-adaptive) cruise control (i.e., a form of misuse of\nautomation in Parasuraman and Riley's terms), the result can be a crash.\nJanssen et al. (2019) discuss this issue in the driving domain by in-\ntroducing a probabilistic (Hidden Markov Model) framework that re-\nlates driver beliefs of the system's mode to actual system modes. Such\nframeworks make explicit in what system states mode confusion might\noccur, and can aid in the (re-) design of safety-critical systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.7**r== 0.2**\nhappen\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.6**r== 0.4**\nconfusion\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\ncontexts.\nVicente et al. (2001) point out that power plants are highly complex\nsystems, which means that some part of the plant will always be under\nrepair or in a state of being modiﬁed. This eﬀectively changes the mode,\nor state, of the plant, and requires operators to act accordingly. Mode\nconfusion might result in a misinterpretation of alarms: depending on\nthe mode of the power plant, an alarm might indicate an actual problem\nor an expected state of operation.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nIn the coming years, human interactions with automation will\ncontinue to be subject to mode confusion. The reason is twofold. First,\nautomation is not the same as autonomy: our automated systems will be\nvery good at what they do, but in some diﬃcult cases, or in legally\nmandated situations, they will require human intervention. Second,\nautomated systems will continue to be applied in a variety of complex\nsituations—after all, that is where they are the most useful. However,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nuse in complex situations will result in multiple modes of operation\n(Sarter and Woods, 1995). Researchers need to focus on creating\nmodels of mode confusion for diﬀerent application areas,\n(e.g.\nJanssen et al., 2019). Such models can then be used in the design and\nevaluation of systems that reduce the frequency, and the consequences,\nof these errors.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.6**\n3.3. Focus, divided attention, and attention management\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nA third theme that has had persistent attention in IJHCS research on\nautomation is creating appropriate workload levels for the human in-\nteracting with automation so as to avoid under- and overload (Van\nGigh, 1971; Rajaonah et al., 2008). Taking a broader perspective, one\ncan say there is a need to understand focus, divided attention, and at-\ntention management.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs automation continues to improve, automated tasks might require\nless human attention and intervention. This allows humans to focus on\nother activities, such as (other) work and play. At the same time, re-\nsearchers expect that humans will continue to play a role in automated\nsystems such as cars, even under higher levels of automation (e.g.,\nJanssen et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2017; Noy et al., 2018; Stone et al.,\n2016). For example, occasional human aid might be needed if the au-\ntomated system encounters an oﬀ-nominal scenario. In such a case,\nhumans need to revert their attention to the automated task, even\nthough they might feel that their preceding task was more urgent to\nthem. These situations require a detailed understanding of multitasking\nin IJHCS,\nand interleaving processes\nJanssen et al., 2015), and a new view on attention management.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\n(see also special\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFocusing on automated vehicles, a large body of research has in-\nvestigated the eﬀectiveness of providing last-minute alerts to warn\ndrivers about situations where human assistance is needed. However, in\nsuch automated circumstances, people's susceptibility to alerts is re-\nduced (Van der Heiden et al., 2018; Lahmer et al., 2018; Scheer et al.,\n2018). Moreover, even if an alert is processed, mode confusion might\nlimit the human driver's understanding of their role and limit their\nability to take the right action (Janssen et al., 2019). Novel perspectives\non attention management might be needed to minimize these dangers.\nFor example, in our own work we have investigated the use of earlier\nwarnings (pre-alerts) to warn drivers before their action is critical\n(Van der Heiden et al., 2017; see also Borojeni et al., 2018). Beyond\nsimply providing warnings, more research is needed into how the\nhuman and the machine can be partners in a task, instead of one taking\nover the task of the other and only warning in case of emergency. The\nsuccess of such systems will rely both on the system's ability to assess\n(e.g., model and predict) the human state and understanding, and also\non the human's ability to understand the system's functioning.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\n4.

Interdisciplinary studies to cover breadth and depth of domains and\nusers\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nOur review of the IJHCS literature has shown that over the past ﬁve\ndecades, research on human-automation interaction has broadened out\ninto diﬀerent areas. We expect that automated systems will continue to\nbroaden out into new domains as the principles and methods behind\nautomated technologies aimed at professional users start to penetrate\nthe broader consumer market aimed at non-professional users. For ex-\nample, automated features from commercial airplanes might make it\nover to non-commercial airplanes that are used by trained, but less\nexperienced pilots.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAt the same time, even though technology branches out, in a sense\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nautomated technology is often still specialized and limited, and its ac-\ncuracy can be improved. In the home environment there are dedicated\nmachines for vacuuming, lawn mowing, or playing music, but few de-\nvices that combine such tasks. Personal virtual assistants like Amazon's\nAlexa, Apple's Siri, or Google Assistant can aid in many tasks, but have\nlimited capabilities (e.g., Cohen et al., 2016; Cowan et al., 2017). On\nthe road, automated cars can tackle ever more complex and demanding\nsituations, but still have exceptions where human assistance is needed.\nIn other words, there are opportunities for improvements in both the\n“depth” (i.e.\nimproving performance on speciﬁc tasks) and the\n“breadth” (i.e., how many tasks and contexts they can handle) of stu-\ndies on automated systems.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs part of the branching out, automated systems will be used more\nfrequently by non-professional users and with this comes a set of im-\nportant questions about human-automation interaction. For example,\nhow are users trained to work with automated safety-critical devices?\nHow are their skills on a task retained if it is not put to use frequently\n(see also Casner et al., 2014)? How are diﬀerent cultures, and diﬀerent\nnorms, customs, and conventions facilitated? Will the adoption and use\nof automated systems beneﬁt a variety of user groups (e.g., automated\nvehicles hold the potential for improved mobility for people who\ncannot drive or do not have access to their own vehicle)?\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.3**\n4.2. Regulation and explainability\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nThe regulatory landscape for automation depends heavily on the\napplication area. Thus, regulation is well-developed for established\nﬁelds, such as for relatively simple medical devices. However, new\ninterconnected medical devices present a challenge for regulation\n(Sokolsky et al., 2011). Even more so, medical robotics, where auto-\nmation can take on various forms, presents a signiﬁcant challenge for\nregulators—in fact, autonomous robots will not only be medical devices\nbut also entities that practice medicine, and it is not yet clear who\nwould be in charge of regulating them (Yang et al., 2017). Similarly,\nregulation is still under development for cars, where automation is only\nnow making signiﬁcant advances (Inners and Kun, 2017).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nA large push on automation research comes from European legis-\nlation on “explainability”. In the context of recent data protection laws,\nEuropean laws now require that decisions that are made for humans by\nautomated systems are explainable to the humans (European Union,\n2016, 2018; see also Goodman and Flaxman, 2017). Automated system\nand (machine learning) algorithms make many decisions, but the rea-\nsons\nthese decisions might be opaque to the end user\n(Burrell, 2016). Moreover, the (decision) models that the algorithms\ncreate to inform their actions necessarily abstract away from some\ndetails in the world. Such abstraction can result in ‘traps’ (Selbst et al.,\n2018) such as an inability to take all of the relevant features into ac-\ncount in decision making (as some were left out in the abstraction) or to\ntransfer learned behavior to new settings (where other features are\nperhaps more important).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nExplainability is not always straightforward for embodied, situated\nautomated systems such as automated cars, as these systems make\nmany decisions over time. For example, at any given time there is an\nexplicit or implicit decision to accelerate or decelerate, and whether to\nmake a steering adjustment (i.e., Michon's control level; Michon, 1985).\nShould cars be able to explain these decisions continuously? And should\nthis be done in real-time? Or should only more strategic decisions\n(Michon, 1985) such as why particular routes were chosen be ex-\nplainable? Or is only hindsight explanation needed surrounding (near-)\naccidents? Although ideally a system should be able to make multiple\nexplanations, whether they do this can impact a user's attention, and\nmight also have impact on system performance (i.e., when dedicating\ncapacity to the storing of decisions). From a human-computer interac-\ntion perspective, explainability of automated systems should at least be\npresent to avoid mode confusion (Janssen et al., 2019) and to avoid\nalert fatigue and the so-called “cry-wolf eﬀect” (Breznitz, 1983; Sorkin,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nLike humans, automated machines are not always “perfect”. The\nalgorithms behind automated systems often get trained on data, and the\nresulting decision systems might be limited by the data (“Garbage in,\ngarbage out”). Speciﬁcally, through the training set, the algorithms\nmight pick up on biases or inequalities that exist in society, which can\nhave consequences for the end users. For example, if a gender classi-\nﬁcation algorithm is trained to classify people based on their physical\nfeatures, it might overlook that biological sex and self-identiﬁed gender\nlabels might not align, and the resulting misgendering might have ne-\ngative impacts on mental health (Hamidi et al., 2018).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nHumans might be able to help learning systems to overcome their\nbiases. For example, in recently proposed guidelines for human-AI in-\nteraction, ﬁve of the eighteen guidelines focus on ways to help users\ncorrect the mistakes of an AI system (Amershi et al., 2019). However, it\nis an open question how to design such systems in practice, in particular\nas there might be a disconnect between the low-level features that a\nsystem needs to adjust to improve, and the high-level concepts that a\nuser (incorrectly) thinks they need to adjust (e.g., Kittley-Davies et al.,\n2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nFrom a legislative perspective, an important question is then also\nwho is to blame when an accident or incident occurs involving an au-\ntomated system in a safety-critical setting. An initial thought might be\nto think locally, with the human operator or the producer, programmer,\nor seller of the technology. However, the introduction of automation is\nsometimes motivated by a narrative to reduce the frequency or prob-\nability of accidents and incidents. Approaching these from a probabil-\nistic viewpoint raises the question of what is an acceptable probability\nof risk, and how this risk is spread over the population. The con-\nsideration of risk at the population level, then turns the question of\n“who is to blame” into a question that is probably larger than one in-\ndividual.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\n4.3. Ethical and social dilemmas\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs automated machines achieve more functionality, various ethical\nand social dilemmas become more urgent and prominent. Our overview\nof the history of IJHCS already touched on one such issue: are in-\ncreasingly\nequals\nautonomous\n(Złotowski et al., 2017)?\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.6**\naccepted\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.7**\nsystems\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.3**r== 0.7**\nsocially\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAnother ethical and social consideration is that of the future of work\nand job security. A model by Frey and Osborne (2017) predicts that\nlow-skill and low-wage jobs, such as in transportation, logistics, and\noﬃce work, in particularly are likely to be replaced by automation.\nFrey and Osborne predict that this will require a shift in skillsets by\nhuman workers to tasks that require creativity or social skills. From our\nperspective, it is unclear whether this prediction will hold, as our lit-\nerature review of IJHCS articles indicates that research is already in-\nvestigating topics such as emotion classiﬁcation and social interaction\nbetween humans and robots (e.g., Brave et al., 2005; Hassanein and\nHead, 2007; Kapoor et al., 2007; Leite et al., 2013). Therefore, we ex-\npect that in the years to come there will be more progress on (partial)\nautomation of creative tasks and social interaction settings than an-\nticipated in the report by Frey and Osborne. If this happens, the ethical\nand social question of job security will be plainly evident.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nMoreover, automation might not increase at a steady, linear pace.\nFor example, Harari (2018) predicts that the pace of improvements in\nautomation might also accelerate as time goes on, thereby making it\never harder for people to catch up with the increasing changes in au-\ntomation and to adapt their skillset. How are humans then equipped for\nthese societal changes? How do we make sure that we create devices\nthat are there for human users? But also, how can technology help to\nachieve a world that provides opportunity for all, and not just for a\nfortunate minority?\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAnother ethical consideration is what decisions automated systems\nshould take in complex life-or-death situations that are imminent in\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nsafety-critical scenarios. Survey research shows that humans would like\nautomated machines to make morally just decisions in principle, yet\nthey also want the system to deviate from this moral path if a moral\naction would require sacriﬁcing their own life or that of their family\nmembers (Bonnefon et al., 2016). Moreover, the survey research shows\nthat there are individual and cultural diﬀerences in what is considered\nmorally just (Awad et al., 2018). Given that humans cannot agree on\nmoral conﬂicts, a lot more research is needed to guide the regulation of\nautomated systems. For example, the Ethics Commission on Automated\nand Connected Driving, which was appointed by the German govern-\nment, has developed a set of twenty ethical rules related to the design,\ndeployment,\nvehicles\n(Ethics Commission, 2017).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.8**r== 0.1**\nautomated\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.7**r== 0.3**\nissues,\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nTaken together, the full set of social and ethical considerations also\nposes a fundamental question: whether to automate at all or not? In\nmost safety-critical scenarios where automation is introduced, such as\nautomated driving, the intention is that introduction of automation or\nautomated support can save lives and reduce incidents. However, the\nnew technology can also introduce new problems and incidents. A\nmoral judgment is needed whether the beneﬁts weigh up against the\nchallenges. Although the inclination of some researchers might be to\nminimize new incidents, this might overlook the beneﬁts of automation\n(see also de Winter, 2019).\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\n4.4. Continued and improved human and humane experiences\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nImplicit in the previously discussed trends is the need to consider\nhuman experience. With automation improving, how can we continue\nto maintain a fair and humane interaction (see also section on ethics)?\nWhich aspects of tasks do we automate, and which tasks do we leave to\nthe human? In line with the historical trend of automated testing (e.g.,\nElithorn et al., 1982; Thompson and Wilson, 1982) and expert systems\n(Motta, 2013; Gaines, 2013; Breuker, 2013), we might expect more\nsoftware tasks to become automated in the coming few years. But which\nparts are automated? How is creativity and expertise embedded cor-\nrectly? If creativity is essential for human contributions to an auto-\nmated task, how do we ensure that humans can contribute this, and\nhow do we know when and where it is needed? Or, if humans would\nlike to focus on other aspects of a task, apart from creativity, how do we\ncontinue to allow them to do so? For example, in a world where au-\ntomated vehicles have penetrated the market, will we allow occasional\nhuman driving “just for fun”? How can this be done in a world where\nother cars might rely on the predictability of non-human actions to\nmaintain a stable driving trajectory? If we do not allow humans to\ncontribute to such tasks and activities, how do we allow a humane\nexperience in other ways? The answers to these questions are not yet\nclear, but needed.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.2**\n4.5. Radical changes to human-automation interaction\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nAs we look into the future, technological advances in human-ma-\nchine interaction, automation, artiﬁcial intelligence, and related dis-\nciplines are likely to usher in dramatic change in how we live with\ncomputing devices. Although such radical shifts are hard to predict\naccurately, some suggestions and trends are noticeable.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.5**r== 0.1**\nOne such change is imagined by Yuval Noah Harari in his book “21\nlessons for the 21st century” (Harari, 2018)—he envisions a world in\nwhich AI will become better than we are at many tasks. If this happens,\nthen one question for human-automation design will be how human\nusers can best use such super-smart AI. Will the humans enjoy the in-\nteractions and engage in them? Will they engage with AI while having\nthe appropriate level of trust, taking into account both the beneﬁts and\nthe potential costs of the interactions? Or will they act like the humans\nin Asimov's (1954) novel “Caves of Steel,” where the people of the Earth\nof about 1000 years in the future fear and reject robots, and the com-\nforts that robots can provide humanity?\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAnother dramatic change is envisioned by the futurist Mark\nPesce—he expects that we will be able to associate digital data with\nphysical objects and view this data through augmented reality glasses\n(Pesce, 2019). Pesce expects that this will lead to the emergence of\nwhat he calls ‘supertools’: tools that can allow us to interact with\ncomputing objects, and thus with the automation around us, while\nhaving at our disposal vast amounts of data about all aspects of the\nwork of automation. One signiﬁcant question for human-computer in-\nteraction design in this case is how to allow users to interact with this\nvast amount of data. Simply put, there will be too much data available\nfor users to be able to handle it all, which means that human-computer\ninteraction design will need to create focused views of the data.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nTurning to art again, and speciﬁcally the science ﬁction of Asimov:\nimagine what it might be like to interact with automation if our in-\nterface technologies can go beyond showing us information with aug-\nmented reality! What if the interfaces could make us feel like the ma-\nchine is an extension of our body? This is what it feels to operate an\nadvanced starship in Asimov's (1982) “Foundation's Edge”—the eﬀort\nrequired to accomplish something is about as much as to think about\nthe goal. Perhaps Asimov overestimated the probability that machines\nwill eventually be able to literally read our minds. But, we can still\nexpect that our minds and the machine automation will not always be\nseparated by keyboards, screens, and brittle speech interfaces. How will\nradically more capable interfaces aﬀect how we can control automa-\ntion, and just as importantly, how we perceive automation and its place\nin our lives?\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAs we contemplate the inevitable radical changes in human-auto-\nmation interaction, it is important to keep asking questions. What are\nthe economic and societal forces that are driving the changes? How will\nnew technologies shape what is possible for these interactions? And\nwhat are the economic and broad societal implications of these dra-\nmatic changes? The answers to these questions will be found through\ninterdisciplinary work that\nincorporates a clear understanding of\nhuman-automation interaction, and leverages it eﬀectively.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nMany previous eras of human development have included radical\nchange in technology, but we expect the change to be faster than it had\nbeen in the past. Where will this change lead us? For all of the themes\nwe mentioned in this document, except for this last one, we have rea-\nsonably clear plans for how to move forward. For some of them, our\nhorizon extends relatively far, for others not that far.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nIn sum, human-automation interaction research has been an area of\nexciting and impactful work for many decades. The readers of IJHCS,\nand more broadly the scientiﬁc community, should expect this trend to\naccelerate in the coming years.\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.8**\nDeclarations of interest\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.9**\nReferences\n**BLOCK**fs== 6.4**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nAmershi, S., Weld, D., Vorvoreanu, M., Fourney, A., Nushi, B., Collisson, P., Suh, J., Iqbal,\nS.T., Bennett, P.N., Inkpen, K., Teevan, J., Kikin-Gil, R., Horvitz, E., 2019.

Janssena,⁎   , Stella F. Donkera, Duncan P. Brumbyb, Andrew L. Kunc   The concepts of automation, and mechanized and automated work have been around for decades. According to the Britannica en- cyclopedia, automation is “the application of machines to tasks once performed by human beings or, increasingly, to tasks that would otherwise be impossible. Although the term mechanization is often used to refer to the simple replacement of human labour by machines, automation generally into a self-governing system.” implies (Groover, 2018).   the integration of machines   The above deﬁnition of automation does not involve the require- ment of a computer processor. However, many modern forms of auto- mated (or sometimes: autonomous) machines, such as power plant monitoring devices, automated cars, drones, robots, and chatbots, do involve computers. These computer-automated systems are used by humans, and humans are expected to remain essential contributors to artiﬁcial systems and automated systems in the future (Stone et al., 2016). The study of human-computer interaction, or more speciﬁcally human-automation interaction, therefore continues to remain relevant as automated systems are used to support more and more everyday activities, overseen by non-technical and non-professional end-users.   In this special   issue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, and its predecessor the International Journal of Man-Machine Studies (from now on   collectively referred to as IJHCS), we review the contributions that IJHCS has made towards the study of human-automation interaction. We therefore analyze published work from the journal to distill historic trends. Our analysis shows that human-automation interaction is a ﬁeld that keeps expanding into new domains and contexts (what we refer to as “breadth”), and also keeps improving its performance within do- mains and contexts (what we refer to as “depth”). Given these expan- sions, and the exposure to more contexts and to a wider and more di- verse group of end-users, there is a potential for the broader human- computer interaction community to contribute skills and knowledge to create and evaluate safe, engaging, and productive automated systems. We close our analysis by discussing eight trends that we deem of particular relevance for this community, classiﬁed in two segments. First, we discuss trends that have been around for a while but continue to remain important: (1) function and task allocation between humans and machines, (2) trust, incorrect use, and confusion, and (3) the bal- ance between focus, divided attention and attention management. Then, we discuss emerging themes: (4) the need for interdisciplinary approaches to cover breadth and depth, (5) regulation and explain- ability, (6) ethical and social dilemmas, (7) allowing a human and humane experience, and (8) radically diﬀerent human-automation in- teraction.   2. History of human-automation interaction   To gain an overview of the number of articles that were published on the topic of human-automation interaction in IJHCS over its 50 year existence, we conducted a Scopus search on January 14th 2019. We collected all articles that had the word “automation”, “automated”, or “autonomous” in either the title, abstract, or keywords. Table 1 reports the number of articles that matched the search query per topic and decade, together with the total number of articles that was published in IJHCS that decade.   The topic of automation covers a substantial subset of the published work in IJHCS: 4–11% of published articles in each decade, with around 5–6% of the articles in the last two decades. These percentages should be interpreted as approximate values, as the count is limited by the keywords that authors used in their paper's title, abstract and keywords section. There might be false alarms (papers that were re- turned based on keywords, but that did not directly address research on human-automation interaction) and misses (papers that are relevant for the ﬁeld of human-automation interaction, but did not include these speciﬁc keywords).   To gain a richer understanding of the themes that are discussed in IJHCS papers on human-automation interaction, our initial keyword search was followed by a qualitative analysis. For this analysis, we sorted the IJHCS papers on human-automation interaction by year of publication. We then read the titles and abstracts of these papers to pick up common themes per decade. This revealed four themes which align well with more general trends in artiﬁcial intelligence (e.g., Russell and Norvig, 2009, chapter 1) and human-computer interaction (e.g., Carroll, 2013). However, as the analysis method is subjective in nature, and limited by the papers that were published in IJHCS, we do not claim that we have identiﬁed all strands of human-automation inter- action research that occurred over the last ﬁve decades. We do claim that we identiﬁed relevant themes, which are discussed in more detail next.   2.1. Start: automation for dedicated domains   Publications on automation in IJHCS largely started oﬀ with the study of dedicated, domain speciﬁc systems. In the 1970s and 1980s a large proportion of published work (around 25 papers) focused speci- ﬁcally on the development and evaluation of automated psychological tests (for overview papers, see e.g. Elithorn et al., 1982; Thompson and Wilson, 1982). The widespread introduction of computers allowed psychology researchers to conduct interactive tasks on computers, in- stead of just pen-and-paper tests or subjective assessment. Nowadays, digital testing is common in experimental studies involving human participants, and has given rise to opportunities for conducting large- scale studies using crowdsourcing platforms, like Amazon's Mechanical Turk (see Gould et al., 2018 for a review). Given the rise and ubiquity of personal computing devices, the idea of completing an online survey would now hardly qualify as an example of “automation” anymore.   A second dedicated domain in which automation was researched is knowledge acquisition (Feigenbaum, 1977). As reviewed in a previous IJHCS special issue (Motta, 2013), one of the main aims within this domain in the 1980s was to be able to develop methods to ‘extract’ knowledge from experts that can be represented in machines. Among our dataset of papers on automation, the top-cited papers from the 1980s all proposed methods for knowledge elicitation (e.g., Belkin   et al., 1987; Diederich et al., 1987; Gruber and Cohen, 1987). Since the 1980s there has been a general shift in perspective that successful knowledge acquisition and knowledge engineering requires more than extracting knowledge. Considerations of systems engineering and al- lowing smart inferences based on multiple sources (e.g., through the internet) are now seen to be key, with modern day knowledge acqui- sition research taking on a broad and multi-disciplinary perspective (see also Motta, 2013; Gaines, 2013; Breuker, 2013).   2.2. Time-sensitive and safety-critical settings   Throughout the last ﬁve decades of IJHCS, automation research has branched out into more domains and settings. One distinct class of re- search is on tasks that are time-sensitive (i.e., require a response within a ﬁnite, short time interval) and/or safety-critical (i.e., where an in- correct action can have disastrous consequences). Work in this area has been published in every decade, but particularly in the 1990s and early 2000s. The range of settings in which time-sensitive and safety-critical tasks have been studied is diverse and varied: from monitoring dynamic processes in factories (e.g., Lee and Moray, 1994), power plants (e.g., Vicente et al., 2001), and other professional settings (e.g., Bahner et al., 2008; van Gigh, 1971), to ﬂight monitoring (e.g., Singh et al., 1997; Skitka et al., 1999, 2000), and semi-automated driving (e.g., Rajaonah et al., 2008, Seppelt and Lee, 2007).   The diversity of domains (and the importance of preventing in- cidents) has allowed an exploration of deep general topics throughout the history of IJHCS, which remain relevant for today's research. They include topics such as how to distribute or allocate tasks between hu- mans and machines (Dearden et al., 2000; Hollnagel and Bye, 2000; Press, 1971; Sheridan, 2000; de Vries et al., 2003; Milewski and Lewis, 1997), ﬁnding the right levels of workload to avoid under- and overload (Van Gigh, 1971; Rajaonah et al., 2008), how to promote appropriate levels of trust in automation (Dzindolet et al., 2003; Lee and Moray, 1994), and how to avoid incorrect use and (human) errors such as through complacency (Bahner et al., 2008) or (human) biases (Skitka et al., 1999, 2000). We will return to the current status of these topics in more detail in our section on the future of human-automation inter- action.   2.3. Embodied, situated agents   Since the 1990s there has been a gradual shift away from static systems for speciﬁc domains (e.g., expert systems, systems for psycho- logical testing) to systems that involve a dynamic intelligent agent that performs a task (e.g., Milewski and Lewis, 1997; Zeng and Sycara, 1998). This continues in the 2000s, with a rise of papers on automated systems that act in a dynamic, physical world. This parallels the po- pularization in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) research of embodied, si- tuated agents (Pfeifer and Scheier, 2001): systems that have their own sensors and that depend on interaction with the environment for per- formance. For example, in the 2000s IJHCS published various studies on physical robots (e.g., Kaber et al., 2006; Sakamoto et al., 2005) and cars (Rajaonah et al., 2008; Seppelt and Lee, 2007). In parallel, there is also research published on aﬀective interaction with robots, and auto- mated (emotion) feature detection (e.g., Bailenson et al., 2008; Brave et al., 2005; Partala and Surakka, 2003). These topics continue in the 2010s, but also broaden out to include, for example, research on human-robot interaction with multiple robots (Chien et al., 2018).   The relevance of considering embodied and situated robotics and automation explicitly is that the actions of embodied, situated systems (at least in part) depend on how the world is perceived through the machine's sensors, and through the environment in which the machine interacts (Pfeifer and Scheier, 2001). Diﬀerent machines can (learn to) act diﬀerently if either their sensors have diﬀerent capabilities or if they are trained in diﬀerent kinds of environments.   these embodied,   Generalization to unknown settings, and adaptation to new settings, requires extensive training for situated robots. Automated vehicles are an example of an embodied, situated robot that acts in and adapts to unknown settings. For automated vehicles, training typically consists of a combination of extensive experience under real-world driving conditions, as well as extensive simulated training sessions to learn how to act in other potential worlds (Madrigal, 2017). By contrast, earlier simpler automated systems, such as, closed-world factory systems, or virtual systems such as a digital psychological test or expert system, require relatively less extensive testing due to their reliance on the assumptions of a closed world.   2.4. Rise of the non-professional users   As chips get smaller and gain more capacity, smart and automated technology is becoming more widely available for use by non-profes- sional users. These users have often not been trained in how to use or operate the system and often do not have a detailed technical under- standing of how the automation works and the limitations on its suc- cessful operation. The last trend that we observe is then that there has been an increase in research on automation for use outside of profes- sional settings. For example, the availability of smart phones and other smart devices that are connected to the internet and allow users to interact with automated systems and processes. Some examples that are covered in IJHCS include electronic shopping (e.g., Hassanein and Head, 2007), robots as social companions (e.g., Leite et al., 2013), and control of semi-automated vehicles (e.g., Rajaonah et al., 2008; Seppelt and Lee, 2007).   While many of the topics that apply to professional (skilled) users of automated systems also apply to non-professional users, there are some additional considerations that come into play for research on how non- professional users interact with automated systems. For example, for non-professional users one cannot rely on extensive training and ex- perience with the technology, and the technology might be used in a wider set of context than that which can be predicted by the profession. Study of use by non-professional users is therefore an emerging setting, discussed in more detail below that requires the full breadth of HCI expertise. Moreover, the use by non-professional users requires further consideration of more ethical topics such as human attitudes towards and acceptance of autonomous systems (Złotowski et al., 2017) and how to handle security and hacking (Chen et al., 2018; Ferreira and Teles, 2019).   2.5. Summary of human-automation interaction research to date   In summary, our analysis of publications in IJHCS on the topic of human-automation interaction shows that research has expanded be- yond the use of automation in dedicated domains such as factory as- sembly lines and automated psychological tests. In particular, there are distinct research lines that investigate the use of automation in time- sensitive or safety-critical settings, through embodied situated agents, and by non-professional users.   Fig. 1 provides a Venn diagram with examples of automated systems for each of these research lines. The Venn diagram also makes explicit how these diﬀerent areas ﬁt together. Speciﬁcally, it identiﬁes that there are many domains and settings in which two or more of these research lines come together. A prime example is the automated car, which involves automation in the form of an embodied, situated agent, which is used by non-professional users in a time-sensitive, safety-   agents,   situated   embodied   considered   For embodied, situated systems some form of automation (or au- tonomy) is almost always required (although by deﬁnition, humans can also and Scheier, 2001). Hence in our Venn Diagram of Fig. 1, embodied, si- tuated agents are represented as a subset of the larger automation ca- tegory. Moreover, whether something is considered embodied and si- tuated might at times be open to interpretation. For example, we opted that a power plant monitoring system is not labeled as embodied and situated, even though such systems can sense and act to maintain a balance in the power plant's processes (e.g., increase or decrease cooling). Our motivation for not including it as a fully embodied, si- tuated agent was that—from our understanding—these systems tend to rely on if-then rules and are less open to dynamic situations that our other examples (e.g., cars and military drones) face.   3. Future of human-automation interaction: evergreen themes   We now turn our attention to the future of human-automation in- teraction research, by describing themes that are important for future work. We start by describing three themes that are “evergreens”: themes that were also covered in the past, but that continue to be im- portant areas for research. In particular, these themes require further expansion due to the breadth of domains and users that are involved in automated settings. After discussing these evergreen topics, we go on to discuss ﬁve new topics in human-automation interaction that we expect to increase in importance over the coming years.   3.1. Function and task allocation between humans and machines   The ﬁrst theme that has had persistent attention in IJHCS research on automation is the distribution or allocation of tasks between humans and automated systems (e.g., Dearden et al., 2000; Hollnagel and Bye, 2000; Press, 1971; Sheridan, 2000; de Vries et al., 2003; Milewski and Lewis, 1997). A simple, naive understanding of the introduction of automation might be that automated systems take over the execution of tasks from humans, and thereby simply ‘reduce’ the amount of work or attention that humans need to dedicate to that task. A colloquial un- derstanding is for example that people are better at some tasks (e.g., to exercise judgment) and machines are better at other tasks (e.g., to perform repetitive routine tasks; Fitts, 1951). However, as analyzed in detail by Sheridan (2000), achieving such allocation in practice is a hard problem, as researchers diﬀer in what they set as appropriate criteria for the function allocation.   In line with this view, it is important to consider the so-called “irony of automation” (Bainbridge, 1983), which states that introduction of automation can radically change how people perceive or act in a spe- ciﬁc context. People do not merely reduce what they work on when (part of) a task is automated, but use diﬀerent strategies for working on that task altogether. For example, one intention of semi-automated vehicles is that the human driver is responsible for fewer basic control- monitoring tasks (e.g., steering, pressing the gas), and can therefore switch his or her attention to monitoring the traﬃc environment and the vehicle. However, a meta-review of research on driving assistance systems suggests that the introduction of automation increases the likelihood that drivers perform non-driving related tasks, which reduces their situational awareness and response time to alerts (de Winter et al., 2014).   Although the problem of function allocation, and related themes, such as the irony of automation, have been known for decades, the associated research questions gain new urgency now that automation is being used by non-professional users in time-sensitive and safety-cri- tical contexts. An underestimation of user interaction in these domains can lead to incidents, and non-professional users might lack the training and experience to cope with system failures. Moreover, they might underestimate risks or misplace their trust in the system. For example,   in the ﬁrst deadly incident with a Tesla model S (a partially automated vehicle), the human driver had a prolonged period of visual distraction shortly before the crash (Habib, 2017). Although the cause of this distraction is unknown, misplaced trust in the automation might have been a factor.   Automation might also change how, when, and where tasks are performed. For example, if cars become more automated, will they turn into mobile oﬃces (Chuang et al., 2018), or areas of fun and play (Kun et al., 2016)? That is, automation might be a radical disruptive innovation that changes more than just the task itself.   3.2. Trust, incorrect use, and confusion   The second major theme of human-automation interaction to have received persistent attention in IJHCS over the years is how to promote appropriate levels of trust in automation (Dzindolet et al., 2003; Lee and Moray, 1994), how to avoid incorrect use and (human) errors (e.g., Bahner et al., 2008; Skitka et al., 1999, 2000), and how to avoid con- fusion.   Parasuraman and Riley (1997) introduced four distinct types of use of automation that can impact a user's trust in a system. Initial use might already depend on trust, but on top of that users and other sta- keholders of automation might misuse the automation (i.e., show overreliance, or too much trust), disuse it (i.e., under rely on the auto- mation and distrust it, for example due to false alarms), or abuse it (i.e., introducing the automation without considering all the consequences of it, in line with the irony of automation, Bainbridge, 1983). These four forms of use, and their impact on trust are still relevant today. They are particularly relevant now that non-professional users are using auto- mation in more settings. As they lack the training and experience of professional users, they might bring in incorrect expectations of the capabilities of the automated system, resulting in misuse or disuse.   How a user uses automation, and how they perceive trust can also be looked at more dynamically, based on a user's understanding of the system's mode of operation over time. The mode, or state, of an auto- mated system determines its response to user input and to changes in the overall context of the system. For example, in automated vehicles,   cruise control and adaptive cruise control can be two automation modes. When human drivers or operators engage adaptive cruise con- trol, their vehicle will attempt to maintain a given speed, but will slow down if there is slower traﬃc ahead; in contrast the same vehicle with (non-adaptive) cruise control will not slow down for slower vehicles ahead. The human operator needs to keep track of mode changes, and also remember how the system will react to user input and context changes in the current mode. Mode confusion (mode error) occurs when the human operator is confused about the current mode of the system, or cannot remember how the system will react in the current mode (Sarter and Woods, 1992).   Mode confusion is highly consequential for safety-critical systems, such as road vehicles, power plants, airplanes, robotic wheelchairs, and ﬂight control systems. In the above example, if the driver mistakenly believes that the vehicle is in the adaptive cruise control mode, when it is actually in (non-adaptive) cruise control (i.e., a form of misuse of automation in Parasuraman and Riley's terms), the result can be a crash. Janssen et al. (2019) discuss this issue in the driving domain by in- troducing a probabilistic (Hidden Markov Model) framework that re- lates driver beliefs of the system's mode to actual system modes. Such frameworks make explicit in what system states mode confusion might occur, and can aid in the (re-) design of safety-critical systems.   happen   confusion   contexts. Vicente et al. (2001) point out that power plants are highly complex systems, which means that some part of the plant will always be under repair or in a state of being modiﬁed. This eﬀectively changes the mode, or state, of the plant, and requires operators to act accordingly. Mode confusion might result in a misinterpretation of alarms: depending on the mode of the power plant, an alarm might indicate an actual problem or an expected state of operation.   In the coming years, human interactions with automation will continue to be subject to mode confusion. The reason is twofold. First, automation is not the same as autonomy: our automated systems will be very good at what they do, but in some diﬃcult cases, or in legally mandated situations, they will require human intervention. Second, automated systems will continue to be applied in a variety of complex situations—after all, that is where they are the most useful. However,   use in complex situations will result in multiple modes of operation (Sarter and Woods, 1995). Researchers need to focus on creating models of mode confusion for diﬀerent application areas, (e.g. Janssen et al., 2019). Such models can then be used in the design and evaluation of systems that reduce the frequency, and the consequences, of these errors.   3.3. Focus, divided attention, and attention management   A third theme that has had persistent attention in IJHCS research on automation is creating appropriate workload levels for the human in- teracting with automation so as to avoid under- and overload (Van Gigh, 1971; Rajaonah et al., 2008). Taking a broader perspective, one can say there is a need to understand focus, divided attention, and at- tention management.   As automation continues to improve, automated tasks might require less human attention and intervention. This allows humans to focus on other activities, such as (other) work and play. At the same time, re- searchers expect that humans will continue to play a role in automated systems such as cars, even under higher levels of automation (e.g., Janssen et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2017; Noy et al., 2018; Stone et al., 2016). For example, occasional human aid might be needed if the au- tomated system encounters an oﬀ-nominal scenario. In such a case, humans need to revert their attention to the automated task, even though they might feel that their preceding task was more urgent to them. These situations require a detailed understanding of multitasking in IJHCS, and interleaving processes Janssen et al., 2015), and a new view on attention management.   (see also special   Focusing on automated vehicles, a large body of research has in- vestigated the eﬀectiveness of providing last-minute alerts to warn drivers about situations where human assistance is needed. However, in such automated circumstances, people's susceptibility to alerts is re- duced (Van der Heiden et al., 2018; Lahmer et al., 2018; Scheer et al., 2018). Moreover, even if an alert is processed, mode confusion might limit the human driver's understanding of their role and limit their ability to take the right action (Janssen et al., 2019). Novel perspectives on attention management might be needed to minimize these dangers. For example, in our own work we have investigated the use of earlier warnings (pre-alerts) to warn drivers before their action is critical (Van der Heiden et al., 2017; see also Borojeni et al., 2018). Beyond simply providing warnings, more research is needed into how the human and the machine can be partners in a task, instead of one taking over the task of the other and only warning in case of emergency. The success of such systems will rely both on the system's ability to assess (e.g., model and predict) the human state and understanding, and also on the human's ability to understand the system's functioning.   4. Future of human-automation interaction: emerging themes   To close, we discuss ﬁve themes that are emerging as important topics in automation research, and which we expect to increase in importance over the years to come.   4.1. Interdisciplinary studies to cover breadth and depth of domains and users   Our review of the IJHCS literature has shown that over the past ﬁve decades, research on human-automation interaction has broadened out into diﬀerent areas. We expect that automated systems will continue to broaden out into new domains as the principles and methods behind automated technologies aimed at professional users start to penetrate the broader consumer market aimed at non-professional users. For ex- ample, automated features from commercial airplanes might make it over to non-commercial airplanes that are used by trained, but less experienced pilots.   At the same time, even though technology branches out, in a sense   automated technology is often still specialized and limited, and its ac- curacy can be improved. In the home environment there are dedicated machines for vacuuming, lawn mowing, or playing music, but few de- vices that combine such tasks. Personal virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, or Google Assistant can aid in many tasks, but have limited capabilities (e.g., Cohen et al., 2016; Cowan et al., 2017). On the road, automated cars can tackle ever more complex and demanding situations, but still have exceptions where human assistance is needed. In other words, there are opportunities for improvements in both the “depth” (i.e. improving performance on speciﬁc tasks) and the “breadth” (i.e., how many tasks and contexts they can handle) of stu- dies on automated systems.   As part of the branching out, automated systems will be used more frequently by non-professional users and with this comes a set of im- portant questions about human-automation interaction. For example, how are users trained to work with automated safety-critical devices? How are their skills on a task retained if it is not put to use frequently (see also Casner et al., 2014)? How are diﬀerent cultures, and diﬀerent norms, customs, and conventions facilitated? Will the adoption and use of automated systems beneﬁt a variety of user groups (e.g., automated vehicles hold the potential for improved mobility for people who cannot drive or do not have access to their own vehicle)?   4.2. Regulation and explainability   The regulatory landscape for automation depends heavily on the application area. Thus, regulation is well-developed for established ﬁelds, such as for relatively simple medical devices. However, new interconnected medical devices present a challenge for regulation (Sokolsky et al., 2011). Even more so, medical robotics, where auto- mation can take on various forms, presents a signiﬁcant challenge for regulators—in fact, autonomous robots will not only be medical devices but also entities that practice medicine, and it is not yet clear who would be in charge of regulating them (Yang et al., 2017). Similarly, regulation is still under development for cars, where automation is only now making signiﬁcant advances (Inners and Kun, 2017).   A large push on automation research comes from European legis- lation on “explainability”. In the context of recent data protection laws, European laws now require that decisions that are made for humans by automated systems are explainable to the humans (European Union, 2016, 2018; see also Goodman and Flaxman, 2017). Automated system and (machine learning) algorithms make many decisions, but the rea- sons these decisions might be opaque to the end user (Burrell, 2016). Moreover, the (decision) models that the algorithms create to inform their actions necessarily abstract away from some details in the world. Such abstraction can result in ‘traps’ (Selbst et al., 2018) such as an inability to take all of the relevant features into ac- count in decision making (as some were left out in the abstraction) or to transfer learned behavior to new settings (where other features are perhaps more important).   Explainability is not always straightforward for embodied, situated automated systems such as automated cars, as these systems make many decisions over time. For example, at any given time there is an explicit or implicit decision to accelerate or decelerate, and whether to make a steering adjustment (i.e., Michon's control level; Michon, 1985). Should cars be able to explain these decisions continuously? And should this be done in real-time? Or should only more strategic decisions (Michon, 1985) such as why particular routes were chosen be ex- plainable? Or is only hindsight explanation needed surrounding (near-) accidents? Although ideally a system should be able to make multiple explanations, whether they do this can impact a user's attention, and might also have impact on system performance (i.e., when dedicating capacity to the storing of decisions). From a human-computer interac- tion perspective, explainability of automated systems should at least be present to avoid mode confusion (Janssen et al., 2019) and to avoid alert fatigue and the so-called “cry-wolf eﬀect” (Breznitz, 1983; Sorkin,   Like humans, automated machines are not always “perfect”. The algorithms behind automated systems often get trained on data, and the resulting decision systems might be limited by the data (“Garbage in, garbage out”). Speciﬁcally, through the training set, the algorithms might pick up on biases or inequalities that exist in society, which can have consequences for the end users. For example, if a gender classi- ﬁcation algorithm is trained to classify people based on their physical features, it might overlook that biological sex and self-identiﬁed gender labels might not align, and the resulting misgendering might have ne- gative impacts on mental health (Hamidi et al., 2018).   Humans might be able to help learning systems to overcome their biases. For example, in recently proposed guidelines for human-AI in- teraction, ﬁve of the eighteen guidelines focus on ways to help users correct the mistakes of an AI system (Amershi et al., 2019). However, it is an open question how to design such systems in practice, in particular as there might be a disconnect between the low-level features that a system needs to adjust to improve, and the high-level concepts that a user (incorrectly) thinks they need to adjust (e.g., Kittley-Davies et al., 2019).   From a legislative perspective, an important question is then also who is to blame when an accident or incident occurs involving an au- tomated system in a safety-critical setting. An initial thought might be to think locally, with the human operator or the producer, programmer, or seller of the technology. However, the introduction of automation is sometimes motivated by a narrative to reduce the frequency or prob- ability of accidents and incidents. Approaching these from a probabil- istic viewpoint raises the question of what is an acceptable probability of risk, and how this risk is spread over the population. The con- sideration of risk at the population level, then turns the question of “who is to blame” into a question that is probably larger than one in- dividual.   4.3. Ethical and social dilemmas   As automated machines achieve more functionality, various ethical and social dilemmas become more urgent and prominent. Our overview of the history of IJHCS already touched on one such issue: are in- creasingly equals autonomous (Złotowski et al., 2017)?   accepted   systems   socially   Another ethical and social consideration is that of the future of work and job security. A model by Frey and Osborne (2017) predicts that low-skill and low-wage jobs, such as in transportation, logistics, and oﬃce work, in particularly are likely to be replaced by automation. Frey and Osborne predict that this will require a shift in skillsets by human workers to tasks that require creativity or social skills. From our perspective, it is unclear whether this prediction will hold, as our lit- erature review of IJHCS articles indicates that research is already in- vestigating topics such as emotion classiﬁcation and social interaction between humans and robots (e.g., Brave et al., 2005; Hassanein and Head, 2007; Kapoor et al., 2007; Leite et al., 2013). Therefore, we ex- pect that in the years to come there will be more progress on (partial) automation of creative tasks and social interaction settings than an- ticipated in the report by Frey and Osborne. If this happens, the ethical and social question of job security will be plainly evident.   Moreover, automation might not increase at a steady, linear pace. For example, Harari (2018) predicts that the pace of improvements in automation might also accelerate as time goes on, thereby making it ever harder for people to catch up with the increasing changes in au- tomation and to adapt their skillset. How are humans then equipped for these societal changes? How do we make sure that we create devices that are there for human users? But also, how can technology help to achieve a world that provides opportunity for all, and not just for a fortunate minority?   Another ethical consideration is what decisions automated systems should take in complex life-or-death situations that are imminent in   safety-critical scenarios. Survey research shows that humans would like automated machines to make morally just decisions in principle, yet they also want the system to deviate from this moral path if a moral action would require sacriﬁcing their own life or that of their family members (Bonnefon et al., 2016). Moreover, the survey research shows that there are individual and cultural diﬀerences in what is considered morally just (Awad et al., 2018). Given that humans cannot agree on moral conﬂicts, a lot more research is needed to guide the regulation of automated systems. For example, the Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected Driving, which was appointed by the German govern- ment, has developed a set of twenty ethical rules related to the design, deployment, vehicles (Ethics Commission, 2017).   automated   issues,   Taken together, the full set of social and ethical considerations also poses a fundamental question: whether to automate at all or not? In most safety-critical scenarios where automation is introduced, such as automated driving, the intention is that introduction of automation or automated support can save lives and reduce incidents. However, the new technology can also introduce new problems and incidents. A moral judgment is needed whether the beneﬁts weigh up against the challenges. Although the inclination of some researchers might be to minimize new incidents, this might overlook the beneﬁts of automation (see also de Winter, 2019).   4.4. Continued and improved human and humane experiences   Implicit in the previously discussed trends is the need to consider human experience. With automation improving, how can we continue to maintain a fair and humane interaction (see also section on ethics)? Which aspects of tasks do we automate, and which tasks do we leave to the human? In line with the historical trend of automated testing (e.g., Elithorn et al., 1982; Thompson and Wilson, 1982) and expert systems (Motta, 2013; Gaines, 2013; Breuker, 2013), we might expect more software tasks to become automated in the coming few years. But which parts are automated? How is creativity and expertise embedded cor- rectly? If creativity is essential for human contributions to an auto- mated task, how do we ensure that humans can contribute this, and how do we know when and where it is needed? Or, if humans would like to focus on other aspects of a task, apart from creativity, how do we continue to allow them to do so? For example, in a world where au- tomated vehicles have penetrated the market, will we allow occasional human driving “just for fun”? How can this be done in a world where other cars might rely on the predictability of non-human actions to maintain a stable driving trajectory? If we do not allow humans to contribute to such tasks and activities, how do we allow a humane experience in other ways? The answers to these questions are not yet clear, but needed.   4.5. Radical changes to human-automation interaction   As we look into the future, technological advances in human-ma- chine interaction, automation, artiﬁcial intelligence, and related dis- ciplines are likely to usher in dramatic change in how we live with computing devices. Although such radical shifts are hard to predict accurately, some suggestions and trends are noticeable.   One such change is imagined by Yuval Noah Harari in his book “21 lessons for the 21st century” (Harari, 2018)—he envisions a world in which AI will become better than we are at many tasks. If this happens, then one question for human-automation design will be how human users can best use such super-smart AI. Will the humans enjoy the in- teractions and engage in them? Will they engage with AI while having the appropriate level of trust, taking into account both the beneﬁts and the potential costs of the interactions? Or will they act like the humans in Asimov's (1954) novel “Caves of Steel,” where the people of the Earth of about 1000 years in the future fear and reject robots, and the com- forts that robots can provide humanity?   Another dramatic change is envisioned by the futurist Mark Pesce—he expects that we will be able to associate digital data with physical objects and view this data through augmented reality glasses (Pesce, 2019). Pesce expects that this will lead to the emergence of what he calls ‘supertools’: tools that can allow us to interact with computing objects, and thus with the automation around us, while having at our disposal vast amounts of data about all aspects of the work of automation. One signiﬁcant question for human-computer in- teraction design in this case is how to allow users to interact with this vast amount of data. Simply put, there will be too much data available for users to be able to handle it all, which means that human-computer interaction design will need to create focused views of the data.   Turning to art again, and speciﬁcally the science ﬁction of Asimov: imagine what it might be like to interact with automation if our in- terface technologies can go beyond showing us information with aug- mented reality! What if the interfaces could make us feel like the ma- chine is an extension of our body? This is what it feels to operate an advanced starship in Asimov's (1982) “Foundation's Edge”—the eﬀort required to accomplish something is about as much as to think about the goal. Perhaps Asimov overestimated the probability that machines will eventually be able to literally read our minds. But, we can still expect that our minds and the machine automation will not always be separated by keyboards, screens, and brittle speech interfaces. How will radically more capable interfaces aﬀect how we can control automa- tion, and just as importantly, how we perceive automation and its place in our lives?   As we contemplate the inevitable radical changes in human-auto- mation interaction, it is important to keep asking questions. What are the economic and societal forces that are driving the changes? How will new technologies shape what is possible for these interactions? And what are the economic and broad societal implications of these dra- matic changes? The answers to these questions will be found through interdisciplinary work that incorporates a clear understanding of human-automation interaction, and leverages it eﬀectively.   Many previous eras of human development have included radical change in technology, but we expect the change to be faster than it had been in the past. Where will this change lead us? For all of the themes we mentioned in this document, except for this last one, we have rea- sonably clear plans for how to move forward. For some of them, our horizon extends relatively far, for others not that far.   In sum, human-automation interaction research has been an area of exciting and impactful work for many decades. The readers of IJHCS, and more broadly the scientiﬁc community, should expect this trend to accelerate in the coming years.   Declarations of interest",

The non-archimedean analogue of the famous Calabi–\nYau problem asks for a given Radon measure µ on the Berkovich analytiﬁcation\nX an with µ(X an) = degL(X) whether there exists a continuous semipositive metric\nk k of L, unique up to scaling, such that\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nc1(L, k k)∧n = µ\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nusing the non-archimedean Monge–Amp`ere measure introduced by Chambert-Loir\non the left. We call (1.1) the non-archimedean Monge–Amp`ere equation. The anal-\nogous problem over the complex numbers was solved by Yau for Radon measures\ngiven by smooth volume forms within the class of smooth metrics. Uniqueness was\nshown before by Calabi. Later Ko lodziej used pluripotential theory to treat more\nsingular measures and solutions [Ko l98].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nYuan and Zhang proved uniqueness up to scaling for solutions of the non-archime-\ndean Monge–Amp`ere equation [YZ17]. In a groundbreaking work, Boucksom, Favre\n**BLOCK**fs== 8.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nDate: February 29, 2024.\nY. Fang, W. Gubler and K. K¨unnemann were supported by the collaborative research center\nSFB 1085 Higher Invariants - Interactions between Arithmetic Geometry and Global Analysis\nfunded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nand Jonsson solved the non-archimedean Monge–Amp`ere equation over a complete\ndiscretely valued ﬁeld K of residue characteristic zero assuming that X is smooth\nand that the support of the Radon measure µ is contained in the skeleton of an SNC-\nmodel (a projective regular model with special ﬁber having simple normal crossing\nsupport) [BFJ15]. They assumed also that K is a completion of the function ﬁeld\nof a curve at a closed point. This geometric condition was later removed by Burgos,\nJell, Martin and the last two authors of this paper [BGJ+20]. Boucksom, Favre,\nand Jonsson used a variational approach to solve (1.1) which relies crucially on the\ncontinuity of the semipositive envelope of a continuous metric of L. They show\ncontinuity of this envelope by using multiplier ideals on SNC-models [BFJ16]. In\ntheir arguments, Hironaka’s resolution of singularities plays an important role in\norder to have suﬃciently many SNC-models at hand. Apart from the multiplier\nideals, it is precisely here where residue characteristic zero is used again.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nIn equicharacteristic p > 0, the following existence result was shown by Jell,\nMartin and the last two authors of this paper [GJKM19]. Similarly as above, it\nis assumed that K is a completion of the function ﬁeld of a curve over a perfect\nﬁeld k of characteristic p > 0. It is also assumed that resolution of singularities and\nembedded resolution of singularities hold in dimension n + 1, see §6.1 for precise\ndeﬁnitions. Then existence of a solution of (1.1) is shown in [GJKM19] if the\nsupport of µ is contained in the skeleton of an SNC-model. The proof is along the\nsame lines as in [BFJ16, BFJ15] replacing multiplier ideals by test ideals. Note\nthat this result is unconditional for n = 2 by using resolution of singularities for\nthree-folds proved by Cossart and Piltant.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nIf K has mixed characteristic, then there are results about the non-archimedean\nMonge–Amp`ere problem for varieties like curves, abelian varieties and toric varieties\nbased on their special geometry [Thu05, Liu11, BGJK21].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.5**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nIn this paper, we deal with the Monge–Amp`ere problem for arbitrary smooth\nprojective varieties over a complete discretely valued ﬁeld K of mixed character-\nistic (0, p). For a complete local noetherian domain R of mixed characteristic,\na theory of test ideals was introduced by Ma and Schwede based on perfectoid\nideas [MS18, MS21]. Using perfectoid methods, prismatic techniques, and a p-adic\nRiemann-Hilbert correspondence, Bhatt was able in 2020 to show a variant of Ko-\ndaira vanishing ‘up to ﬁnite covers’ in mixed characteristic [Bha20]. Applications to\nthe minimal model program were given by Bhatt, Ma, Patakfalvi, Schwede, Tucker,\nWaldron, and Witaszek [BMP+21] and independently by Takamatsu and Yoshikawa\n[TY21]. For projective normal schemes over R, these ideas were extended by Hacon,\nLamarche and Schwede. They introduced +-test ideals and showed global genera-\ntion results [HLS21]. Their construction, which replaces spaces of global sections by\nso-called spaces of +-stable sections from[BMP+21, TY21], is recalled in §3. Hacon,\nLamarche and Schwede conjecture that subadditivity holds for their +-test ideals\n[HLS21, Conjecture 8.3]. Observe that subaddivity is well known for multiplier\nresp. test ideals in the equicharacteristic case. While this conjecture remains open,\na modiﬁed version of +-test ideals, which we call perturbation friendly global test\nideals in this article, was introduced by Bhatt, Ma, Patakfalvi, Schwede, Tucker,\nWaldron, and Witaszek [BMP+24], again beneﬁting from a p-adic Riemann-Hilbert\ncorrespondence. These perturbation friendly test ideals enjoy properties as nice\nas the +-test ideals of Hacon, Lamarche and Schwede, and in addition satisfy the\nsubadditivity property. We refer to §4 for details.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThe contribution of this paper is to show that global +-test ideals and perturba-\ntion friendly global test ideals allow applications to the non-archimedean Monge–\nAmp`ere problem in mixed characteristic.

Let X be projective model of X. We assume that resolution of\nsingularities holds for projective models of X. Then for any ample line bundle L on\nX, there exists m ∈ N>0 and an ample extension L ′ of L⊗m to a regular S-model\nX ′ of X with a projective morphism X ′ → X over S extending the identity on X.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nProof. The arguments are the same as for [GJKM19, Lemma 7.5]. In a ﬁrst step,\nwe start with a projective model Y of X such that L extends to an ample line\nbundle H on Y , possibly replacing L by a positive tensor power. By a result of\nL¨utkebohmert [L¨ut93, Lemma 2.2], there is a blowing up π : Z → Y in an ideal\nsheaf supported in the special ﬁber of Y such that the identity on X extends to a\nmorphism Z → X . A property of blowing ups [Har77, Proposition II.7.13] shows\nthat π∗(H ⊗ℓ) ⊗ OZ /Y (1) is an ample line bundle on Z with generic ﬁber L⊗ℓ for\nsuﬃciently large ℓ. Replacing X by Z and L by L⊗ℓ, we conclude that we may\nassume that L extends to an ample line bundle H on X .\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 9.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nBy a result of P´epin [P´ep13, Thm. 3.1], there is a a blowing-up morphism\nπ′ : Z ′ → X centered in the special ﬁber of X such that Z ′ is semi-factorial. So\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nsimilarly as in the ﬁrst step, replacing X by Z ′ and L by a positive tensor power,\nwe may assume that L extends to an ample line bundle H on a semi-factorial\nprojective model X . This is the conclusion of the second step.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nThen we apply resolution of singularities to X to get a projective S-morphism\nπ : X ′ → X which is an isomorphism on generic ﬁbers and so we may identify\nthe generic ﬁber of X ′ with X. Since π is projective, there is an ℓ > 0 such that\nL ′ := π∗(H ⊗ℓ) ⊗ OX ′/X (1) is an ample line bundle on X ′. However, we do\nnot know if π is a blow up in an ideal supported in the special ﬁber and hence\nthe restriction F of OX ′/X (1) to the generic ﬁber X of X ′ might be non-trivial.\nSince X is semi-factorial, F extends to a line bundle F on X and we can replace\nOX ′/X (1) by OX ′/X (1) ⊗ ϕ∗(F −1). Then L ′ is a model of L⊗ℓ proving the\n\nclaim.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nRemark 6.5. If we assume additionally that embedded resolution of singularities\nholds for regular projective models of X, then we can choose X ′ as an SNC-model\nin Lemma 6.4. Indeed, we replace X ′ in the above proof by applying embedded\nresolution of singularities to the closed subset X ′\ns of the regular projective model\nX ′ to get an SNC-model of X.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n7.

If u ∈ C0(X an), then Pθ(u) is a uniform limit of θ-psh model functions and\nthus Pθ(u) is continuous on X an.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nProof. Using that u is a uniform limit of model functions on X, we may assume\nthat u is itself a model function by [GJKM19, Proposition 2.9(v)]. The model\nfunction u is deﬁned by a vertical Q-divisor on a proper model X of X over S. By\n[GJKM19, Proposition 2.9(7)], we may replace (θ, u) for the proof by (mθ, mu) for\nsome m ∈ N. Hence we may assume without loss of generality that u is actually\nIf we apply [L¨ut93, Lemma 2.2] to X and\ndeﬁned by a vertical divisor on X .\na projective model of X as in Remark 6.2, then X is dominated by a projective\nmodel of X. Hence we can assume without loss of generality that X is a projective\nmodel. Then we choose a resolution of singularities X ′ → X as in Lemma 6.4\nsuch that some power L⊗m of L extends to an ample line bundle A on the regular\nprojective model X ′ of X. As before we may assume that m = 1. By [GJKM19,\nProposition 2.9(4)], we get\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nPθ(u) = Pθ+ddcu(0) + u.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 10.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nBy construction the class θ + ddcu is induced by a line bundle L on X ′ whose\nrestriction to X is isomorphic to L and Theorem 5.1 shows that Pθ+ddcu(0) is a\n\nuniform limit of (θ + ddcu)-psh model functions. This ﬁnishes our proof.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.3**\n8.

In this section, we consider a projective regular variety X over\nK. We assume that resolution of singularities holds for projective models of X and\nembedded resolution of singularities holds for regular projective models of X. It\nfollows that every projective model of X is dominated by a projective SNC-model.\nBy Lemma 6.4 and Remark 6.5, any ample line bundle on X extends to an ample\nline bundle on a suitable dominating SNC model after possibly passing to a positive\ntensor power. As explained in [GJKM19, Section 9], these assumptions are enough\nto set up a pluripotential theory for θ-psh functions with respect to a closed (1, 1)-\nform θ on X an with ample de Rham class {θ}. All the results of [BFJ16, Sections\n1–7] hold. If we assume continuity of the envelope for ample line bundles on X, then\nmonotone regularization [BFJ16, Theorem 8.7] holds as well in our setting which is\ncrucial to extend the Monge–Amp`ere measure MAθ(ϕ) from θ-psh model functions\nto bounded θ-psh functions on X an. Then the results from [BFJ16, Sections 4–6]\nhold in our setting by the same arguments.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nTheorem 8.1. Let X be a smooth projective variety over K of dimension n and\nlet θ be a closed (1, 1)-form on X an with ample de Rham class {θ} such that res-\nolution of singularities holds for projective models of X and embedded resolution\nof singularities holds for regular projective models of X. We consider a positive\nRadon measure µ on X an of total mass {θ}n which is supported on the skeleton of\na projective SNC-model of X. Then there is a continuous θ-psh function ϕ on X an\nsuch that MAθ(ϕ) = µ and ϕ is unique up to additive constants.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nProof. Uniqueness follows from a result of Yuan and Zhang, see [BFJ15, §8.1]. To\nprove existence of a θ-psh solution ϕ, the variational method of Boucksom, Favre,\nand Jonsson is used. Continuity of the envelope for ample line bundles on X holds\nby Theorem 7.1. By [BGJ+20, Theorems 6.3.2, 6.3.3], we conclude that θ satisﬁes\nthe orthogonality property. Then existence of a continuous solutions follows from\n\n[BFJ15, Theorem 8.1].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 11.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.2**r== 0.2**\nRemark 8.2.

The Monge–Amp`ere equation References   Let L be an ample line bundle on an n-dimensional projective variety X over a non-archimedean ﬁeld K. The non-archimedean analogue of the famous Calabi– Yau problem asks for a given Radon measure µ on the Berkovich analytiﬁcation X an with µ(X an) = degL(X) whether there exists a continuous semipositive metric k k of L, unique up to scaling, such that   c1(L, k k)∧n = µ   using the non-archimedean Monge–Amp`ere measure introduced by Chambert-Loir on the left. We call (1.1) the non-archimedean Monge–Amp`ere equation. The anal- ogous problem over the complex numbers was solved by Yau for Radon measures given by smooth volume forms within the class of smooth metrics. Uniqueness was shown before by Calabi. Later Ko lodziej used pluripotential theory to treat more singular measures and solutions [Ko l98].   Yuan and Zhang proved uniqueness up to scaling for solutions of the non-archime- dean Monge–Amp`ere equation [YZ17]. In a groundbreaking work, Boucksom, Favre   and Jonsson solved the non-archimedean Monge–Amp`ere equation over a complete discretely valued ﬁeld K of residue characteristic zero assuming that X is smooth and that the support of the Radon measure µ is contained in the skeleton of an SNC- model (a projective regular model with special ﬁber having simple normal crossing support) [BFJ15]. They assumed also that K is a completion of the function ﬁeld of a curve at a closed point. This geometric condition was later removed by Burgos, Jell, Martin and the last two authors of this paper [BGJ+20]. Boucksom, Favre, and Jonsson used a variational approach to solve (1.1) which relies crucially on the continuity of the semipositive envelope of a continuous metric of L. They show continuity of this envelope by using multiplier ideals on SNC-models [BFJ16]. In their arguments, Hironaka’s resolution of singularities plays an important role in order to have suﬃciently many SNC-models at hand. Apart from the multiplier ideals, it is precisely here where residue characteristic zero is used again.   In equicharacteristic p > 0, the following existence result was shown by Jell, Martin and the last two authors of this paper [GJKM19]. Similarly as above, it is assumed that K is a completion of the function ﬁeld of a curve over a perfect ﬁeld k of characteristic p > 0. It is also assumed that resolution of singularities and embedded resolution of singularities hold in dimension n + 1, see §6.1 for precise deﬁnitions. Then existence of a solution of (1.1) is shown in [GJKM19] if the support of µ is contained in the skeleton of an SNC-model. The proof is along the same lines as in [BFJ16, BFJ15] replacing multiplier ideals by test ideals. Note that this result is unconditional for n = 2 by using resolution of singularities for three-folds proved by Cossart and Piltant.   If K has mixed characteristic, then there are results about the non-archimedean Monge–Amp`ere problem for varieties like curves, abelian varieties and toric varieties based on their special geometry [Thu05, Liu11, BGJK21].   In this paper, we deal with the Monge–Amp`ere problem for arbitrary smooth projective varieties over a complete discretely valued ﬁeld K of mixed character- istic (0, p). For a complete local noetherian domain R of mixed characteristic, a theory of test ideals was introduced by Ma and Schwede based on perfectoid ideas [MS18, MS21]. Using perfectoid methods, prismatic techniques, and a p-adic Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, Bhatt was able in 2020 to show a variant of Ko- daira vanishing ‘up to ﬁnite covers’ in mixed characteristic [Bha20]. Applications to the minimal model program were given by Bhatt, Ma, Patakfalvi, Schwede, Tucker, Waldron, and Witaszek [BMP+21] and independently by Takamatsu and Yoshikawa [TY21]. For projective normal schemes over R, these ideas were extended by Hacon, Lamarche and Schwede. They introduced +-test ideals and showed global genera- tion results [HLS21]. Their construction, which replaces spaces of global sections by so-called spaces of +-stable sections from[BMP+21, TY21], is recalled in §3. Hacon, Lamarche and Schwede conjecture that subadditivity holds for their +-test ideals [HLS21, Conjecture 8.3]. Observe that subaddivity is well known for multiplier resp. test ideals in the equicharacteristic case. While this conjecture remains open, a modiﬁed version of +-test ideals, which we call perturbation friendly global test ideals in this article, was introduced by Bhatt, Ma, Patakfalvi, Schwede, Tucker, Waldron, and Witaszek [BMP+24], again beneﬁting from a p-adic Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. These perturbation friendly test ideals enjoy properties as nice as the +-test ideals of Hacon, Lamarche and Schwede, and in addition satisfy the subadditivity property. We refer to §4 for details.   The contribution of this paper is to show that global +-test ideals and perturba- tion friendly global test ideals allow applications to the non-archimedean Monge– Amp`ere problem in mixed characteristic. More precisely, we prove the following results.   Theorem 1.1. Let L be an ample line bundle on a smooth projective variety X over K.   (i) If k k is a model metric on L induced by a model (X , L ) of (X, L) with X regular and if L has an ample model A on X , then the semipositive envelope of the metric k k is continuous.   (ii) If resolution of singularities holds for projective K ◦-models of X, then the semipositive envelope of any continuous metric k k of L is continuous.   This follows from Theorem 5.1 and Theorem 7.1 by Remark 8.2. This result is the key to apply the variational method of Boucksom–Favre–Jonsson as we will see in Theorem 8.1.   Theorem 1.2. Let L be an ample line bundle on an n-dimensional smooth projec- tive variety X over K. If resolution of singularities holds for projective models of X and embedded resolution of singularities holds for regular projective models of X, then the non-archimedean Monge–Amp`ere equation (1.1) is solved by a continuous semipositive metric k k of L, unique up to scaling, if the positive Radon measure µ has support in the skeleton of an SNC-model of X.   2. Model metrics, curvature forms and psh envelopes   Non-archimedean pluripotential theory in higher dimensions was introduced by Boucksom, Favre and Jonsson [BFJ16]. We recall basic notions of non-archimedean pluripotential theory following [GJKM19, 2.1-2.8].   Let X be a proper variety over a non-archimedean ﬁeld K. A model of X is a proper ﬂat scheme X over S := Spec K ◦ together with an isomorphism h from X to the generic ﬁber Xη of the S-scheme X . The special ﬁber of X is denoted by Xs. Let L be a line bundle over X. A model of (X, L) is given by a model X of X and a line bundle L over X with an isomorphism of L to h∗(L |Xη ).   Let (X , L ) be a model of (X, L⊗m) for some m ∈ N>0. The model metric k kL |g| on U an ∩ red−1(Us), where U on Lan over X an is determined by kskL := m p is open in X , s is a section of L over U := X ∩ U , b is a frame of L over U , g ∈ OX (U ) with s⊗m = gb over U and redX : X an → Xs is the reduction map. A model metric k k on Oan X induces a so-called model function − log k1k : X an → R. The Q-vector space of all model functions on X is denoted by D(X).   Let a be an ideal sheaf on a model X of X which is supported in the special ﬁbre. The exceptional divisor E of the blowup Y of X in a deﬁnes a model (Y , OY (E)) of (X, OX ). The associated model function in D(X) is denoted by log |a|.   Given a model X of X one deﬁnes N 1(X /S)Q as the quotient of Pic(X )Q by the subspace generated by line bundles whose restriction to every closed curve C in the special ﬁber Xs has degree zero. Call α ∈ N 1(X /S) := N 1(X /S)Q ⊗Q R nef if α · C ≥ 0 for all such curves.   The space of closed (1,1)-forms on X is deﬁned as   Z 1,1(X) := R ⊗Q lim −→   where the direct limit is taken over all isomorphism classes of models of X. For the model metric induced by a model L of L⊗m, its curvature form c1(L, k kL ) is the image of L ⊗ 1 m ∈ N 1(X /S)Q in Z 1,1(X). By construction we have a map ddc : D(X) → Z 1,1(X) given by g 7→ c1(OX , k k · e−g). Call a closed (1, 1)-form θ ∈ Z 1,1(X) semipositive if it can be represented by a nef element in N 1(X /S) for some model X . Denote by N 1(X) the quotient of Pic(X)R by numerical equivalence. The map { } : Z 1,1(X) → N 1(X) induced by the restriction maps N 1(X /S) → N 1(X) sends a closed (1, 1)-form θ to its de Rham class {θ}. A class in N 1(X) is called ample if it is an R>0-linear combination of classes induced by ample line bundles on X.   We ﬁx θ ∈ Z 1,1(X). A model function ϕ ∈ D(X) is called θ-plurisubharmonic (θ-psh for short) if the class θ +ddcϕ ∈ Z 1,1(X) is semipositive. The space of all psh model functions is denoted by PSHD (X, θ). For a continuous function u ∈ C 0(X an), its θ-psh envelope Pθ(u) : X an → R ∪ {−∞} is the function deﬁned by   Pθ(u)(x) := sup   ϕ ∈ PSHD (X, θ), ϕ ≤ u    For u ∈ C0(X an), v ∈ D(X) and t ∈ R>0 we have   Pθ(u) − v = Pθ+ddcv(u − v),   (2.1) (2.2) If the de Rham class {θ} ∈ N 1(X) is ample, then PSHD (X, θ) is non-empty, Pθ(u) takes value in R, and we have   Ptθ(tθ) = tPθ(u).   sup X an   |Pθ(u) − Pθ(u′)| ≤ sup X an   for all u, u′ ∈ C0(X an). For further properties of θ-psh model functions and the θ-psh envelope we refer to [BFJ16] and [GJKM19, Section 2]   For θ ∈ Z 1,1(X) that has an ample de Rham class {θ}, we consider ϕ ∈ PSHD (X, θ) and we assume that there exists a normal model X of X such that θ and ϕ are induced by line bundles M and L on X . The Monge–Amp`ere measure MAθ(ϕ) is the discrete measure   (OXs,ξV ) degM ⊗L (V ) δxV   on X an where V runs through the irreducible components of Xs, xV ∈ X an is the unique preimage of the generic point ξV of V under redX , and δxV denotes the Dirac probability measure supported in xV . For generalization of the Monge– Amp`ere measure to all θ ∈ Z 1,1(X) with ample de Rham class {θ} and to more general classes of θ-psh functions, we refer to [BFJ15], [GJKM19] and Section 8.   3. Global test ideals in mixed characteristic   In this section, we introduce the global +-test ideals deﬁned and studied by Hacon, Lamarche and Schwede in [HLS21]. The +-test ideals form a mixed charac- teristic analogue of the theories of multiplier ideals in characteristic zero and test ideals in positive characteristic. The theory is based on the notion of +-stable sections introduced in [BMP+21, TY21].   Let (R, m, k) be a complete noetherian local ring of mixed characteristic. Let p > 0 denote the characteristic of the residue ﬁeld k. Let X be a normal integral scheme which is proper over S := Spec R. The canonical sheaf ωX is reﬂexive ([Sta21, Tag 0AWK] and [Har94, Theorem 1.9]) and we ﬁx a canonical divisor KX with ωX = OX (KX ) [Sta21, Tag 0EBM].   Deﬁnition 3.1. For a reﬂexive sheaf M = OX (M ) associated with a divisor M and an eﬀective Q-divisor B on X , the subspace of +-stable sections of the adjoint line bundle ωX ⊗ M relative to B   X , B, OX (KX + M )     X , OX (KX + M )     is deﬁned by   Y , OY (KY + ⌈f ∗(M − B)⌉    X , OX (KX + M )    where an algebraic closure κ(X ) of the function ﬁeld κ(X ) is ﬁxed, and f runs through the ﬁnite surjective morphisms f : Y → X from a normal integral scheme   Y together with an embedding κ(Y ) ֒→ κ(X ) [HLS21, Deﬁnition 3.2 and Lemma 3.8].   Remark 3.2. If M − B is Q-Cartier, then Deﬁnition 3.1 holds as well if f runs through the alterations f : Y → X from a normal integral scheme Y together with an embedding κ(Y ) ֒→ κ(X ) [HLS21, Lemma 3.8].   For the rest of this section, we assume that the scheme X is regular and projec-   tive over S.   Deﬁnition 3.3. Take a very ample line bundle H on X . For an eﬀective Q-divisor B on X and for each i ∈ N the subspace   X , B, ωX ⊗ H i    generates the subsheaf Ni ⊂ ωX ⊗ H i which deﬁnes   Ji := Ni ⊗ H −i ⊂ ωX .   The sequence (Ji)i∈N is increasing and becomes stationary. Deﬁne the +-test submodule τ+(ωX , B) to be Ji for i ≫ 0 [HLS21, Deﬁnition 4.3].   Remark 3.4. (i) Deﬁnition 3.3 does not depend on the choice of H [HLS21, Proposition 4.5].   (ii) For i ≫ 0 we have H 0(X , τ+(ωX , B)⊗H i) = B0(X , B, ωX ⊗H i)) [HLS21, Proposition 4.7]. If B′ ≥ B, then τ+(ωX , B′) ⊂ τ+(ωX , B) and if F is an eﬀective Cartier divisor, then [HLS21, Lemma 4.8]   τ+(ωX , B + F ) = τ+(ωX , B) ⊗ OX (−F ).   (iii) Equality (3.3) allows one to deﬁne τ+(ωX , B) for a not necessarily eﬀective Q-divisor B as τ+(ωX , B + F ) ⊗ OX (F ) where F is a Cartier divisor such that B + F is eﬀective [HLS21, Deﬁnition 4.14].   Deﬁnition 3.5. For an eﬀective Q-divisor B on X , the ideal sheaf   τ+(OX , B) := τ+(ωX , KX + B)   is the called the +-test ideal associated with B [HLS21, Deﬁnition 4.15, Lemma 4.18]. Using F = −KX in Remark 3.4(iii), this is indeed a coherent ideal sheaf.   We recall the subadditivity conjecture of Hacon, Lamarche and Schwede [HLS21,   Conjecture 3.6. Given eﬀective Q-divisors D and E on X , we have   τ+(OX , D + E) ⊂ τ+(OX , D) · τ+(OX , E).   The above conjecture is still open, but Bhatt, Ma, Patakfalvi, Schwede, Tucker, Waldron and Witaszek prove subadditivity for their new perturbation-friendly test ideals which we will introduce in the next section.   4. Perturbation friendly global test ideals   In this section, we present the perturbation friendly global test ideals after Bhatt, Ma, Patakfalvi, Schwede, Tucker, Waldron, and Witaszek [BMP+24]. They are suitable for our purpose as subadditivity is known for them in contrast to the test ideals considered in the previous section.   Let (R, m, k) be a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic with ﬁeld of fractions K. We ﬁx a ﬂat projective integral regular scheme X over S = Spec(R). We ﬁx a canonical divisor KX with ωX = OX (KX ).   Deﬁnition 4.1. Let B be a Q-divisor on X . By [BMP+24, Proposition 7.14(f)], there is a unique perturbation friendly test module τ (ωX , B) such that there exists an eﬀective Cartier divisor G0 with the property that   τ (ωX , B) = τ+(ωX , B + εG)   for all divisors G ≥ G0 on X and all 0 < ε ≪ 1 (depending on G).   We deﬁne the perturbation friendly test ideal   τ (OX , B) := τ (ωX , KX + B).   Both the test module τ (ωX , B) and the test ideal τ (OX , B) are coherent [BMP+24, If B is eﬀective, then the fractional ideal sheaf Deﬁnition 7.12, Theorem 7.13]. τ (OX , B) is indeed an ideal sheaf in OX [BMP+24, Deﬁnition 7.18].   Here are some properties of perturbation friendly test ideals τ (OX , B) including subadditivity which holds only conjecturally [HLS21, Conjecture 8.3] for the test ideals τ+(OX , B).   Remark 4.2. Let B, B1, B2 be Q-divisors on X .   (i) By [BMP+24, Corollary 7.19(b)], there exists a Cartier divisor G0 with the property that τ (OX , B) = τ+(OX , B + εG) for all divisors G ≥ G0 on X and all 0 < ε ≪ 1 (depending on G).   (ii) If B is a Q-divisor and F is a divisor on X , then (3.3), (4.1), and (4.2) yield   τ (ωX , B + F ) = τ (ωX , B) ⊗ OX (−F ),   τ (OX , B + F ) = τ (OX , B) ⊗ OX (−F )   (iii) (Subadditivity) The perturbation friendly test ideals satisfy the subadditivity   property [BMP+24, Theorem 7.20(e)], i.e. we have   τ (OX , B1 + B2) ⊂ τ (OX , B1) · τ (OX , B2)   for eﬀective Q-divisors B1, B2 on X .   (iv) (Eﬀective global generation) Let B be eﬀective and let D be a divisor such that the Q-divisor D − KX − B is big and nef, and let H be a globally gen- erated ample divisor. Then τ (OX , B) ⊗ OX (nH + D) is globally generated by B0(X , B, OX (nH + D)) for all n ≥ dim(X ⊗R k) [BMP+24, Corollary 7.22].   (v) (τ (OX , 0) is vertical) Recall that a coherent ideal of X is called vertical if its support is contained in the special ﬁber. Let X := X ⊗R K denote the generic ﬁbre of X , put KX := KX |X , and recall that the Grauert–Riemenschneider sheaf J (X, ωX ) on the regular scheme X equals ωX [BMP+24, Deﬁnition A.1]. We conclude from [BMP+24, Proposition 7.14(c)], and formula (4.3) above that   τ (OX , 0)|X = τ (ωX , 0) ⊗OX OX (−KX )|X = J (X, ωX ) ⊗OX OX (−KX ) = OX .   It follows that the ideal sheaf τ (OX , 0) is vertical.   Deﬁnition 4.3. Let D be a divisor on X with linear series |D| 6= 0 and λ ∈ Q>0. Deﬁne the perturbation friendly test ideal of the linear series |D| to be   Thanks to the Noetherian assumption, one can pick a ﬁnite number of elements D1, . . . , Dr in |D| such that   r i=1 τ (OX , λ · Di) agrees with (4.5).   Lemma 4.4. If D is a divisor on X with linear system |D| 6= ∅, then   τ (OX , |D|) = b|D| · τ (OX , 0) (4.6) where b|D| := Im(H 0(X , O(D)) ⊗R O(−D) → OX ) denotes the base ideal of the linear system |D|.   Proof. Our proof follows Hacon, Lamarche and Schwede [HLS21, Lemma 7.5(b)]. Using (4.4) and (4.5), one gets   τ (OX , 0) ⊗ OX (−E) = b|D| · τ (OX , 0),   which shows (4.6).   Deﬁnition 4.5. Let D be a Q-divisor with Itaka dimension κ(D) ≥ 0, so mD is a divisor such that |mD| 6= ∅ for all large and suﬃciently divisible m ∈ N, and λ ∈ Q>0. Deﬁne the asymptotic perturbation friendly test ideal of |D| by   Lemma 4.6. The asymptotic test ideals satisﬁes the following properties:   (i) For large and suﬃciently divisible m ∈ N, one has   τ (OX , λ · ||D||) = τ OX ,   · |mD|. (ii) If |D| 6= ∅, then τ (OX , λ · |D|) ⊂ τ (OX , λ · ||D||). (iii) If λ < µ, (λ, µ) ∈ Q2 (iv) If k ∈ N>0, then τ (OX , λ · ||D||) = τ (OX , λ   >0, then τ (OX , µ · ||D||) ⊂ τ (OX , λ · ||D||).   Proof. The stabilization property (i) follows from the Noetherian assumption if one observes that τ (OX , λ m′ |m′D|) for all m, m′ ∈ N where m divides m′. Now Properties (ii)–(iv) follow as in [HLS21, Lemma 7.5(a),(c),(d),(f)]. In fact (ii) holds by deﬁnition, (iii) is a consequence of Remark 3.4(ii) together with (4.1),  (4.5) and (4.7), and (iv) follows immediately from (i).   m |mD|) ⊂ τ (OX , λ   One can show eﬀective global generation and subadditivity also for the asymp-   totic perturbation friendly global test ideals.   Theorem 4.7. Let D be a Q-divisor on X with Itaka dimension κ(D) ≥ 0.   (i) Let H = OX (H) be a globally generated ample line bundle, E be a divisor,   and λ ∈ Q>0. Let n = dim X ⊗R k. If E − KX − λD is big and nef, then   τ (OX , λ · ||D||) ⊗ OX (nH + E)   is globally generated by a sub linear series of H 0(X , OX (nH + E)) for all n ≥ dim(X ⊗R k).   (ii) For q, r ∈ N>0, we have   OX , qr · kDk   OX , r · kDk    Proof. (i) follows from [BMP+24, Remark 8.36]. For the convenience of the reader we give a proof following [HLS21, Lemma 7.5 (e)]. For suﬃciently divisible m ∈ N we conclude from (4.8) that   τ (OX , λ · ||D||) ⊗ OX (nH + E) = τ OX ,   · |mD| ⊗ OX (nH + E) λ m   · Di ⊗ OX (nH + E)   X i=1 where we pick a ﬁnite number of elements D1, . . . , Dr in |mD| as in Deﬁnition 4.3. From Remark 4.2(iv) we conclude that   τ OX , is globally generated by B0(X , λ all n ≥ dim(X ⊗R k). This ﬁnishes the proof of (i).   · Di ⊗ OX (nH + E)   λ m m · Di, OX (nH + E)) ⊂ H 0(X , OX (nH + E)) for   (ii) By homogeneity of asymptotic test ideals seen in Lemma 4.6(iv), we may   assume r = 1. For suﬃciently divisible m, we deduce from (4.8) that   For any eﬀective divisor Dm ∼ mD, using subadditivity in Remark (4.2)(iii) for the Q-divisor 1   m Dm, we get q m   · Dm = τ OX , q ·   and hence   proving the claim.   5. Continuity of the envelope of the zero function   Let K be a complete discretely valued ﬁeld of mixed characteristic (0, p). Let X be a n-dimensional smooth projective variety over K and L an ample line bundle on X. In the approach of Boucksom–Favre–Jonsson [BFJ16, BFJ15] to pluripotential theory on X an, a model L of L on the model X induces a curvature form θ on X an and we denote by Pθ(f ) the θ-psh envelope of a continuous real function f on X an, see [GJKM19, 2.4–2.6] for details. We follow the strategy from [BFJ16] and [GJKM19] to show continuity of the envelope of the zero function Pθ(0).   Theorem 5.1. We assume that (X, L) has a model (X , A ) with X regular and with A an ample line bundle on X . Let θ be the curvature form on X an induced by any model L on X of L and let am be the base ideal of L m on X . Then (m−1 log |am|)m∈N>0 is a sequence of θ-psh model functions which converges uni- formly on X an to the envelope Pθ(0) of the zero function. It follows in particular that Pθ(0) is continuous.   am = H 0(X , L m) ⊗ L −m ⊂ OX   associated with L . Write L = OX (D) for some divisor D on X . Let   bm := τ (OX , m · kDk) ⊂ OX denote the associated asymptotic perturbation friendly test ideal of exponent m in mixed characteristic. Note that we denote base ideals by a and reserve b for test ideals, to keep the same notations as in [BFJ16] and [GJKM19]. Motivated by Lemma 4.6 and Remark 4.2(v), we consider also the coherent ideals   m := am · τ (OX , 0) ⊂ am ⊂ OX . a′   These ideals have the following properties:   (a) We have a′   m ⊂ bm and these coherent ideal sheaves are vertical for m   suﬃciently large and divisible.   (b) We have bml ⊂ bl (c) There exists m0 ≥ 0 such that bm ⊗ A ⊗m0 ⊗ L ⊗m is globally generated   m for all l, m ∈ N>0.   for all m > 0.   Indeed these properties can be seen as follows: By deﬁnition of the asymptotic test ideals, we have τ (OX , |mD|) ⊂ bm. For suﬃciently large and divisible m we have m = am · τ (OX , 0) = τ (OX , |mD|) ⊂ bm a′   by Lemma 4.4, and the base ideal am is vertical as L is ample. Since a′ τ (OX , 0), Remark 4.2(v) yields that a′   m is vertical. This proves (a).   Property (b) follows from Theorem 4.7(ii). Property (c) is shown as follows. Choose a divisor H on X such that OX (H) is ample and globally generated. We have n = dim X ⊗R k. As A is ample, we can choose m0 ∈ N such that the line bundle   is globally generated. Given m ∈ N we apply Theorem 4.7(i) to E := mD+H +KX . Since E − mD − KX = H is big and nef, we get that   bm ⊗ OX (mD + H + KX + nH) is globally generated. Taking the tensor product of (5.1) and (5.2) we see that bm ⊗ A ⊗m0 ⊗ L ⊗m is globally generated.   Finally (a), (b) and (c) imply our claim by the strategy of the proof of [BFJ16, Thm. 8.5]. For convenience of the reader, we give here some details. For m ≫ 0, let   m which is a super-additive sequence of θ-psh functions as shown at the beginning of the proof of loc. cit.. Then Step 1 of the quoted proof shows that Pθ(0) = supm ϕm = limm ϕm on the quasi-monomial points of X an. Using [GJKM19, Proposition 2.10], this holds pointwise on the whole X an.   We also consider the functions   log |am · τ (OX , 0)| = ϕm +   log |τ (OX , 0)|.   It follows from the above that the sequence ϕ′ on X an.   m also converges pointwise to Pθ(0)   Then Step 2 of loc. cit. works again in our setting using (a) – (c) above as follows. For m suﬃciently large as above and for all l ∈ N>0, we have seen in (a) and (b) that a′   m for all l ∈ N>0 and hence   log |bm| ≥ lim m on X an. The remaining part of the proof of Step 2 is literally the same as in loc. cit. and even simpler as we have Step 1 on X an and not only on the quasi-monomial  points of X an. Note that we use the global generation property (c) there.   6. Resolution of singularities   Let K ◦ be a complete discrete valuation ring with ﬁeld of fractions K and S :=   Spec K ◦. Let X be a smooth projective variety over K of dimension n.   Deﬁnition 6.1. We say that resolution of singularities holds for projective models of X if for every projective model X of X there exists a regular S-scheme X ′ and a projective S-morphism X ′ → X which induces an isomorphism on X.   Remark 6.2. If one chooses an immersion X → Pm K, then the scheme theoretic image X of X in Pm If resolution of singularities holds for projective models of X, then there is a regular projective model X ′ of X over S.   S deﬁnes a projective model of X over S.   Resolution of singularities holds if n = 1 [Art86, Theorem (1.1)]. Cossart and Piltant have shown that resolution of singularities holds for n = 2 up to the pro- jectivity of the morphism X ′ → X [CP19, Theorem 1.1]. It is only shown in loc. cit. that this morphism is locally projective.   It is essential to show that projective models are dominated by SNC-models. In   order to prove this we are going to use the following assumption.   Deﬁnition 6.3. We say that embedded resolution of singularities holds for regular projective models of X if for every regular projective model and every proper closed subset Z of X , there is a projective morphism of S-schemes π : X ′ → X such that the set π−1(Z) is the support of a normal crossing divisor and such that π is an isomorphism over X \\ Z.   Lemma 6.4. Let X be projective model of X. We assume that resolution of singularities holds for projective models of X. Then for any ample line bundle L on X, there exists m ∈ N>0 and an ample extension L ′ of L⊗m to a regular S-model X ′ of X with a projective morphism X ′ → X over S extending the identity on X.   Proof. The arguments are the same as for [GJKM19, Lemma 7.5]. In a ﬁrst step, we start with a projective model Y of X such that L extends to an ample line bundle H on Y , possibly replacing L by a positive tensor power. By a result of L¨utkebohmert [L¨ut93, Lemma 2.2], there is a blowing up π : Z → Y in an ideal sheaf supported in the special ﬁber of Y such that the identity on X extends to a morphism Z → X . A property of blowing ups [Har77, Proposition II.7.13] shows that π∗(H ⊗ℓ) ⊗ OZ /Y (1) is an ample line bundle on Z with generic ﬁber L⊗ℓ for suﬃciently large ℓ. Replacing X by Z and L by L⊗ℓ, we conclude that we may assume that L extends to an ample line bundle H on X .   By a result of P´epin [P´ep13, Thm. 3.1], there is a a blowing-up morphism π′ : Z ′ → X centered in the special ﬁber of X such that Z ′ is semi-factorial. So   similarly as in the ﬁrst step, replacing X by Z ′ and L by a positive tensor power, we may assume that L extends to an ample line bundle H on a semi-factorial projective model X . This is the conclusion of the second step.   Then we apply resolution of singularities to X to get a projective S-morphism π : X ′ → X which is an isomorphism on generic ﬁbers and so we may identify the generic ﬁber of X ′ with X. Since π is projective, there is an ℓ > 0 such that L ′ := π∗(H ⊗ℓ) ⊗ OX ′/X (1) is an ample line bundle on X ′. However, we do not know if π is a blow up in an ideal supported in the special ﬁber and hence the restriction F of OX ′/X (1) to the generic ﬁber X of X ′ might be non-trivial. Since X is semi-factorial, F extends to a line bundle F on X and we can replace OX ′/X (1) by OX ′/X (1) ⊗ ϕ∗(F −1). Then L ′ is a model of L⊗ℓ proving the  claim.   Remark 6.5. If we assume additionally that embedded resolution of singularities holds for regular projective models of X, then we can choose X ′ as an SNC-model in Lemma 6.4. Indeed, we replace X ′ in the above proof by applying embedded resolution of singularities to the closed subset X ′ s of the regular projective model X ′ to get an SNC-model of X.   7. Continuity of the envelope   Let K be a complete discretely valued ﬁeld of mixed characteristic (0, p) and S := Spec K ◦. Let L be an ample line bundle on a regular projective variety X of dimension n over K. Let θ be a closed (1, 1)-form on X with ample de Rham class {θ} induced by a model L of L on a model X of X.   Theorem 7.1. Assume that resolution of singularities holds for projective models of X. If u ∈ C0(X an), then Pθ(u) is a uniform limit of θ-psh model functions and thus Pθ(u) is continuous on X an.   Proof. Using that u is a uniform limit of model functions on X, we may assume that u is itself a model function by [GJKM19, Proposition 2.9(v)]. The model function u is deﬁned by a vertical Q-divisor on a proper model X of X over S. By [GJKM19, Proposition 2.9(7)], we may replace (θ, u) for the proof by (mθ, mu) for some m ∈ N. Hence we may assume without loss of generality that u is actually If we apply [L¨ut93, Lemma 2.2] to X and deﬁned by a vertical divisor on X . a projective model of X as in Remark 6.2, then X is dominated by a projective model of X. Hence we can assume without loss of generality that X is a projective model. Then we choose a resolution of singularities X ′ → X as in Lemma 6.4 such that some power L⊗m of L extends to an ample line bundle A on the regular projective model X ′ of X. As before we may assume that m = 1. By [GJKM19, Proposition 2.9(4)], we get   Pθ(u) = Pθ+ddcu(0) + u.   By construction the class θ + ddcu is induced by a line bundle L on X ′ whose restriction to X is isomorphic to L and Theorem 5.1 shows that Pθ+ddcu(0) is a  uniform limit of (θ + ddcu)-psh model functions. This ﬁnishes our proof.   8. The Monge–Amp`ere equation   Let K be a complete discretely valued ﬁeld with valuation ring R of mixed characteristic (0, p). In this section, we consider a projective regular variety X over K. We assume that resolution of singularities holds for projective models of X and embedded resolution of singularities holds for regular projective models of X. It follows that every projective model of X is dominated by a projective SNC-model. By Lemma 6.4 and Remark 6.5, any ample line bundle on X extends to an ample line bundle on a suitable dominating SNC model after possibly passing to a positive tensor power. As explained in [GJKM19, Section 9], these assumptions are enough to set up a pluripotential theory for θ-psh functions with respect to a closed (1, 1)- form θ on X an with ample de Rham class {θ}. All the results of [BFJ16, Sections 1–7] hold. If we assume continuity of the envelope for ample line bundles on X, then monotone regularization [BFJ16, Theorem 8.7] holds as well in our setting which is crucial to extend the Monge–Amp`ere measure MAθ(ϕ) from θ-psh model functions to bounded θ-psh functions on X an. Then the results from [BFJ16, Sections 4–6] hold in our setting by the same arguments.   Theorem 8.1. Let X be a smooth projective variety over K of dimension n and let θ be a closed (1, 1)-form on X an with ample de Rham class {θ} such that res- olution of singularities holds for projective models of X and embedded resolution of singularities holds for regular projective models of X. We consider a positive Radon measure µ on X an of total mass {θ}n which is supported on the skeleton of a projective SNC-model of X. Then there is a continuous θ-psh function ϕ on X an such that MAθ(ϕ) = µ and ϕ is unique up to additive constants.   Proof. Uniqueness follows from a result of Yuan and Zhang, see [BFJ15, §8.1]. To prove existence of a θ-psh solution ϕ, the variational method of Boucksom, Favre, and Jonsson is used. Continuity of the envelope for ample line bundles on X holds by Theorem 7.1. By [BGJ+20, Theorems 6.3.2, 6.3.3], we conclude that θ satisﬁes the orthogonality property. Then existence of a continuous solutions follows from  [BFJ15, Theorem 8.1].   Remark 8.2. If L is an ample line bundle on X and if θ is induced by a model (X , L ) of (X, L), then there is a bijective correspondence [BFJ15, §2.6]   {θ-psh functions} ←→ {semipositive metrics of L}, ϕ 7−→ k kL · e−ϕ.   It follows that Theorem 5.1 and Theorem 7.1 imply Theorem 1.1 and that Theorem 8.1 implies Theorem 1.2.

This protocol is based on “time-dependent resonance”, where the frequency\ncorresponds to the time-dependent energy gap. Through numerical calculations, we showed that this\nprotocol serves as an optimal control protocol. This approach enables efficient and high-precision\ntransitions to the target state. Our findings provide a new perspective on quantum optimal control\ntheory and suggest potential applications in qubit controls and quantum information processing.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nINTRODUCTION\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nQuantum control has been widely applied in various fields, including quantum computing and quantum sensing,\nand is recognized as an essential foundation for these technologies [1–4]. Optimal control theory plays a critical\nrole in the design of control protocols that minimize specific costs, and its applications have extended to quantum\nannealing [5, 6] and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [7] which is a type of variational\nquantum algorithm [8, 9]. One advantage of this method is that, unlike shortcut to adiabaticity [10], it does not require\nadditional terms in the Hamiltonian, making it both simpler and more practical for experimental implementations.\nHowever, applying optimal control theory to high-dimensional systems becomes often impractical due to the increase\nin computational complexity. Therefore, understanding the analytical behavior or characteristic properties of optimal\ncontrol remains a significant challenge in advancing quantum control theory [11].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nAdiabatic control, as one of the quantum control methods, is applied in various experiments [12–14]. Further-\nmore, in the context of quantum algorithms, it plays a significant role in several algorithms, including the adiabatic\nstate preparation algorithm [15–19]. Ideally, the system should be manipulated infinitely slowly, but in practice, it\nis operated at a finite speed, which introduces errors. We refer to the regime where these errors remain small as\nthe nearly-adiabatic regime. Previous study has shown that optimal control in the nearly-adiabatic regime involves\ncharacteristic oscillations where the driving frequency is determined by the time-dependent energy gap of the Hamil-\ntonian [20]. This finding also suggests that optimal control in the adiabatic regime could potentially be determined\nanalytically. To address this issue, we applied optimal control to the simplest yet nontrivial case of a two-level system.\nBy approximately solving the dynamics of this system, we demonstrated that “time-dependent resonance” plays an\nimportant role in controlling the dynamics, enabling the probability of remaining in the ground state to approach 1\nwith a minimal cost.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFurthermore, by numerically solving for the optimal control that minimizes the transition probability to the excited\nstate as the cost function, we confirmed that the resulting optimal control is consistent with the control protocol\nbased on “time-dependent resonance”. This study provides new insights into quantum optimal control in the nearly-\nadiabatic regime and offers valuable knowledge that contributes to the advancement of quantum control theory and\nits potential applications in quantum technologies.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.4**r== 0.3**\nII. ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMICS\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn this section, we analyze the dynamics under the following “time-dependent resonance” Hamiltonian:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 0.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.5**r== 0.4**\nAn,k(t) sin ϕn(t, tr,k)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.1**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\n−αk\nEn(t)\n t\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nand n is assumed to be odd for simplicity.\ntr,k represents the time when the Stokes line intersects the real axis,\nwhich is explained later. Here are some comments on this Hamiltonian. First, En(t) is the positive eigenvalue of the\nHamiltonian when there are no oscillations (i.e., αk = 0):\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nHn(t) = vn+1tnσz + ∆σx.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nSince the frequency in the Hamiltonian Hn(t) is given by ˙ϕn(t, t0) = 2En(t),\nit can be understood as a reso-\nnance oscillation corresponding to the time-dependent energy gap. For this reason, this Hamiltonian is referred\nto as “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonian. We note that previous study has considered oscillations of the form\nsin(2En(t)t) [20].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFurther definitions of notations are provided. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian Hn(t) are denoted by |En,±(t)⟩,\nand the time-evolution operator is expressed as Un(t, t0). On the other hand, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian Hn(t)\nare denoted by |En,±(t)⟩, and the time-evolution operator is expressed as Un(t, t0). In particular, the eigenstates of\nthis Hamiltonian Hn(t) are expressed as\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.3**r== 0.6**\ntan θn(t) =\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\ncos θn(t)\nsin θn(t)\n∆\nvn+1t\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.4**l== 0.6**r== 0.3**\nsin θn(t)\n− cos θn(t)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.5**t== 0.5**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFrom now on, the initial time t0 is omitted in the notation of the time-evolution operator for simplicity. Furthermore,\nby introducing the dimensionless quantity τ = vt, the Schr¨odinger equation can be rewritten as\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n˜An,k(τ ) sin ϕn(τ, τr,k)\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhere the Hamiltonian is also expressed in a dimensionless form with ˜◦ = ◦/v. Under this dimensionless Hamiltonian,\nwe analyze how the transition probability between eigenstates behaves. Let the initial time be τ0 and the final time\nbe τf . The transition probability between eigenstates is given by\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nFirst, we consider the dynamics under a Hamiltonian without oscillatory terms:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.4**r== 0.3**\nPe := |⟨En,+(τf )| Un(τf ) |En,−(τ0)⟩|2.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nHn(τ ) = τ nσz + ˜∆σx.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFor n = 1, this is known as the Landau-Zener-St¨uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) model [21–24], which can be solved\nexactly. However, for other values of n, the solution is not known. However, in the adiabatic regime, the transition\namplitude over an infinite time interval has been studied [25, 26] using the Dykhne–Davis–Pechukas (DDP) formula\n[27, 28]. To analyze the dynamics in the adiabatic regime, the turning points, which are the zeros of the energy En(τ ),\nand the Stokes lines originating from these turning points play an important role [29]. The definition of the Stokes\nline is as follows:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.7**\nFor the Hamiltonian Hn(t),\n**BLOCK**fs== 7.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.4**r== 0.5**\nτc,±,k = e±i( π\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 1.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nare the turning points.

First, it is evident that there exists an amplitude ˜α0 in the nearly-adiabatic\nregime and long-time limit, where the derived approximation is valid, that makes the transition probability 0. This\neffect results from the mitigation of transitions caused by the minimum energy gap at τ = 0 in the absence of\noscillations. Furthermore, for 0 < ˜αk < ˜αk,opt, ∂Pe( ˜α)/d˜αk < 0 holds, indicating that the transition probability\ndecreases monotonically from ˜αk = 0. Therefore, when numerically determining the optimal control, this control may\nbe selected without encountering any barriers.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFIG. 2. Comparison between the numerical results and the analytical approximation of Pe for (Left) n = 1, τf = −τ0 = 100\nand ˜∆ = 1 and (Right) n = 3, τf = −τ0 = 5, ˜∆ = 1. It can be seen that the results agree well in the region of small amplitudes.\nThe black dashed line indicates ˜α0,opt. In the case of n = 3, the optimal values for ˜α1 and ˜α2 were used.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 3.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nNext, we focus on the results for n = 1. It is found that the optimal amplitude ˜α0,opt decreases exponentially with\n˜∆. This behavior results from the “time-dependent resonant” term (1). Due to this term, the cancellation of the\ndynamical phase from adiabatic time evolution and the oscillation phase happens in (4). Let us consider the case of\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nharmonic oscillations with a constant amplitude A and phase ˜ωτ for cases where the oscillation phase and dynamical\nphase do not cancel. The transition probability in this case becomes [33]\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\n|⟨E+(τf )| U (τf ) |E−(τ0)⟩|2\n\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhere C is a suitable constant satisfying |C| = 1. It is necessary to set at least A−1\nto make\ntransition probability 0. A comparison between the optimal amplitudes for these cases and “time-dependent resonant”\ncase is shown in Fig. 3, which demonstrates that “time-dependent resonance” achieves the desired transitions with\nsmaller amplitudes in nearly-adiabatic regime.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFIG. 3. Comparison of optimal amplitudes for resonance and harmonic oscillations. It is found that the more adiabatic the\nprocess becomes, the “time-dependent resonance” can suppress the transition probability with a smaller amplitude.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFinally, it is important to note the aspects that also influence cases where the goal is to enhance transition proba-\nbilities, such as in the dynamically assisted Schwinger mechanism [34]. In the case of “time-dependent resonance”, for\namplitudes sufficiently large compared to the LZSM transition probability e− ˜∆2π/2, the transition probability scales\nproportionally to the square of the amplitude. In contrast, for harmonic oscillations, the transition amplitude scales\napproximately as A2e−π ˜∆2 \n, which decreases exponentially with ˜∆, as shown in Fig. 3. Thus, to\n1 ˜F1\n\nachieve an O(1) transition amplitude, the amplitude A must increase exponentially with ˜∆. Based on these discus-\nsions, it is evident that “time-dependent resonance” provide an efficient mechanism for enabling state operations in\nthe nearly-adiabatic regime.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFrom the above, it was found that “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonian induces state transitions with small\namplitudes in the nearly-adiabatic regime. Next, we numerically demonstrate that “time-dependent resonant” Hamil-\ntonian provides optimal control for state transitions.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 4.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.3**r== 0.3**\nIII.

The initial control before optimization is denoted as u0(t) and we assume\nu0(t) = vn+1tn. We derive the dimensionless quantities in the same manner as discussed previously and use them\nin the subsequent discussion. More detailed optimal control conditions and experimental results are summarized in\n[29].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.3**\nWe conduct numerical experiments for the problem.

As clear from the figure, the optimal control ˜uopt(τ ) oscillates\naround the initial control ˜u0(τ ). In particular, the amplitude near τ = 0 is the largest and significantly affects the\ndynamics.\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.4**t== 0.6**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFIG. 4.

Here, |ψopt(τ )⟩ represents the state evolving under the optimal\ncontrol, and |E1,−(τ )⟩ is the instantaneous eigenstate corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian H1(τ ). The\ndashed lines represent the (Left) initial control and (Right) the probability of obtaining the ground state under the initial\ncontrol.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.3**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe optimal and analytically derived amplitudes of oscillation ˜αopt for adiabaticity and large time are compared in\nFig. 5. In the nearly-adiabatic regime and long-time limit, it is found that the numerically determined optimal control\ncoincides with the “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonian. On the other hand, when the long-time limit does not\nhold, it becomes necessary to revise the derivation. Such a scenario is particularly important in cases involving time\ndependencies similar to those in quantum annealing, as discussed in previous studies [9, 20]. The analysis of cases\nwhere the long-time limit does not hold, including through the context of this scenario, is discussed in detail in [29].\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThe above analysis corresponds to the case where the initial control has n = 1. Next, we will examine the case\nof n = 3. In this case, the analytically derived “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonian consisted of a sum of three\noscillations. A comparison between this analytical solution and the specific numerical optimal control is shown in 6.\nAs can be seen from this figure, the analytically derived control and the numerically determined optimal control agree\nwell.\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 5.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.8**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFinally, let us comment on the extension to multi-level systems. While the method using “time-dependent reso-\nnance” is effective for controlling transitions between two states, it may not be suitable for controlling transitions\namong three or more states. Therefore, if the transition probability to the second or higher excited states is initially\nzero in free dynamics, the “time-dependent resonance” may serve as the optimal control. However, if the transition\nprobability to the second or higher excited states is non-zero, while the transition to the first excited state can be\nminimized, it cannot be considered the optimal control for maximizing the probability of remaining in the ground\nstate [29].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nFIG. 5.

SUMMARY\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.2**t== 0.7**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn this study, we analyzed control using “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonians, which includes an oscillatory term\nwith a time-dependent energy gap as its frequency, applied to a simple yet nontrivial two-level system. Through the\nanalysis of the dynamics, we concluded that “time-dependent resonance” is effective for state control and confirmed\nthat it is consistent with the results of numerical optimal control calculations. While we considered control to suppress\nstate transitions, we believe that this approach could also play a significant role in cases such as the dynamically\nassisted Schwinger model, where the cost is defined by the excitation rate of the state [34].\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.4**r== 0.4**\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 6.0**b== 0.1**t== 0.9**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nThis work was supported by Japan’s MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program under Grant No. JPMXS0120319794\n**BLOCK**fs== 9.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.9**t== 0.1**l== 0.4**r== 0.3**\nAppendix A: Exact WKB Analysis\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nIn this section, we briefly summarize the results of [35]. The exact WKB analysis was originally discussed as an\nanalytical method for second-order differential equations. Similarly, it can also be applied to the Schr¨odinger equation\nof a two-level system, especially in the adiabatic regime. Here, we consider the following form of the Hamiltonian:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.8**t== 0.2**l== 0.1**r== 0.5**\nThe eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are expressed as:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.7**t== 0.3**l== 0.1**r== 0.1**\nwhere we assume E+(τ ) > E−(τ ) ∀τ ∈ R and no degeneracy occurs. In this method, the turning points, where the\nenergy becomes zero, play a crucial role. For simplicity, we consider the case where there is only one turning point in\nthe upper half-plane:\n**BLOCK**fs== 10.0**p== 7.0**b== 0.6**t== 0.4**l== 0.1**r== 0.2**\nwhere Im τc > 0.

         " Quantum control has been widely applied in various fields, including quantum computing and quantum sensing, and is recognized as an essential foundation for these technologies [1–4]. Optimal control theory plays a critical role in the design of control protocols that minimize specific costs, and its applications have extended to quantum annealing [5, 6] and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [7] which is a type of variational quantum algorithm [8, 9]. One advantage of this method is that, unlike shortcut to adiabaticity [10], it does not require additional terms in the Hamiltonian, making it both simpler and more practical for experimental implementations. However, applying optimal control theory to high-dimensional systems becomes often impractical due to the increase in computational complexity. Therefore, understanding the analytical behavior or characteristic properties of optimal control remains a significant challenge in advancing quantum control theory [11].   Adiabatic control, as one of the quantum control methods, is applied in various experiments [12–14]. Further- more, in the context of quantum algorithms, it plays a significant role in several algorithms, including the adiabatic state preparation algorithm [15–19]. Ideally, the system should be manipulated infinitely slowly, but in practice, it is operated at a finite speed, which introduces errors. We refer to the regime where these errors remain small as the nearly-adiabatic regime. Previous study has shown that optimal control in the nearly-adiabatic regime involves characteristic oscillations where the driving frequency is determined by the time-dependent energy gap of the Hamil- tonian [20]. This finding also suggests that optimal control in the adiabatic regime could potentially be determined analytically. To address this issue, we applied optimal control to the simplest yet nontrivial case of a two-level system. By approximately solving the dynamics of this system, we demonstrated that “time-dependent resonance” plays an important role in controlling the dynamics, enabling the probability of remaining in the ground state to approach 1 with a minimal cost.   Furthermore, by numerically solving for the optimal control that minimizes the transition probability to the excited state as the cost function, we confirmed that the resulting optimal control is consistent with the control protocol based on “time-dependent resonance”. This study provides new insights into quantum optimal control in the nearly- adiabatic regime and offers valuable knowledge that contributes to the advancement of quantum control theory and its potential applications in quantum technologies.   In this section, we analyze the dynamics under the following “time-dependent resonance” Hamiltonian:   An,k(t) sin ϕn(t, tr,k)   −αk En(t)  t   and n is assumed to be odd for simplicity. tr,k represents the time when the Stokes line intersects the real axis, which is explained later. Here are some comments on this Hamiltonian. First, En(t) is the positive eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian when there are no oscillations (i.e., αk = 0):   Hn(t) = vn+1tnσz + ∆σx.   Since the frequency in the Hamiltonian Hn(t) is given by ˙ϕn(t, t0) = 2En(t), it can be understood as a reso- nance oscillation corresponding to the time-dependent energy gap. For this reason, this Hamiltonian is referred to as “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonian. We note that previous study has considered oscillations of the form sin(2En(t)t) [20].   Further definitions of notations are provided. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian Hn(t) are denoted by |En,±(t)⟩, and the time-evolution operator is expressed as Un(t, t0). On the other hand, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian Hn(t) are denoted by |En,±(t)⟩, and the time-evolution operator is expressed as Un(t, t0). In particular, the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian Hn(t) are expressed as   tan θn(t) =   From now on, the initial time t0 is omitted in the notation of the time-evolution operator for simplicity. Furthermore, by introducing the dimensionless quantity τ = vt, the Schr¨odinger equation can be rewritten as   ˜An,k(τ ) sin ϕn(τ, τr,k)   where the Hamiltonian is also expressed in a dimensionless form with ˜◦ = ◦/v. Under this dimensionless Hamiltonian, we analyze how the transition probability between eigenstates behaves. Let the initial time be τ0 and the final time be τf . The transition probability between eigenstates is given by   First, we consider the dynamics under a Hamiltonian without oscillatory terms:   Pe := |⟨En,+(τf )| Un(τf ) |En,−(τ0)⟩|2.   Hn(τ ) = τ nσz + ˜∆σx.   For n = 1, this is known as the Landau-Zener-St¨uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) model [21–24], which can be solved exactly. However, for other values of n, the solution is not known. However, in the adiabatic regime, the transition amplitude over an infinite time interval has been studied [25, 26] using the Dykhne–Davis–Pechukas (DDP) formula [27, 28]. To analyze the dynamics in the adiabatic regime, the turning points, which are the zeros of the energy En(τ ), and the Stokes lines originating from these turning points play an important role [29]. The definition of the Stokes line is as follows:   For the Hamiltonian Hn(t),   are the turning points. Using this, the transition amplitude for τ0 ≃ −∞ and τf ≃ ∞ can be approximated as follows [29]:   ⟨En,+(τf )| Un(τf ) |En,−(τ0)⟩ =   (−1)kei  τr,k   where τr,k represents the time when the Stokes line originating from τc,+,k intersects the real axis (Fig. 1). It is noted that we can understand from this expression that the exact WKB analysis corresponds to the adiabatic-impulse approximation [30, 31] in the nearly-adiabatic region.   Next, we consider the dynamics under the Hamiltonian Hn(τ ), which includes oscillatory terms. Treating the Hamil- tonian Hn(τ ), without oscillatory terms, as the free Hamiltonian, the time-evolution operator can be approximated perturbatively as   Un(τ ) ≃ Un(τ ) − iUn(τ )   ˜An,k(s) sin ϕn(s, τr,k),   where the picture is called as “Furry picture” [32]. Thus, the transition probability can be approximated as   ⟨En,+(τf )| Un(τf ) |En,−(τ0)⟩   − i ⟨En,+(τf )| Un(τf )     F (s)ds |En,−(τ0)⟩     where it was assumed that the amplitude is sufficiently small at τ = τ0 and τf , allowing the approximation |En,±(τ )⟩ ≃ |En,±(τ )⟩.   The first term in (3) corresponds to the free dynamics (2). On the other hand, the second term represents the   first-order perturbative term arising from the oscillations. This term can be approximated as   − i ⟨En,+(τf )| Un(τf )   F (s)ds |En,−(τ0)⟩   where the DDP formula was applied to ignore the counter-rotating term, and terms negligible in the adiabatic regime were omitted. Thus, the transition probability can be approximated as       k=0  (−1)ke−2 Im  τc,+,k   and the condition for the transition probability to be zero is given by   Let us compute using a specific Hamiltonian for the case of n = 1 and n = 3. In the long-time limit −τ0 ≃ τf ≃ ∞,   the optimal amplitude for n = 1 is   and for n = 3 is   A comparison between the analytical results (5) and numerical calculations of the transition probability is shown in Fig. 2. It is observed that the results agree well in the region of small amplitude.   Now, let us comment on these results. First, it is evident that there exists an amplitude ˜α0 in the nearly-adiabatic regime and long-time limit, where the derived approximation is valid, that makes the transition probability 0. This effect results from the mitigation of transitions caused by the minimum energy gap at τ = 0 in the absence of oscillations. Furthermore, for 0 < ˜αk < ˜αk,opt, ∂Pe( ˜α)/d˜αk < 0 holds, indicating that the transition probability decreases monotonically from ˜αk = 0. Therefore, when numerically determining the optimal control, this control may be selected without encountering any barriers.   Next, we focus on the results for n = 1. It is found that the optimal amplitude ˜α0,opt decreases exponentially with ˜∆. This behavior results from the “time-dependent resonant” term (1). Due to this term, the cancellation of the dynamical phase from adiabatic time evolution and the oscillation phase happens in (4). Let us consider the case of   harmonic oscillations with a constant amplitude A and phase ˜ωτ for cases where the oscillation phase and dynamical phase do not cancel. The transition probability in this case becomes [33]   |⟨E+(τf )| U (τf ) |E−(τ0)⟩|2    where C is a suitable constant satisfying |C| = 1. It is necessary to set at least A−1 to make transition probability 0. A comparison between the optimal amplitudes for these cases and “time-dependent resonant” case is shown in Fig. 3, which demonstrates that “time-dependent resonance” achieves the desired transitions with smaller amplitudes in nearly-adiabatic regime.   Finally, it is important to note the aspects that also influence cases where the goal is to enhance transition proba- bilities, such as in the dynamically assisted Schwinger mechanism [34]. In the case of “time-dependent resonance”, for amplitudes sufficiently large compared to the LZSM transition probability e− ˜∆2π/2, the transition probability scales proportionally to the square of the amplitude. In contrast, for harmonic oscillations, the transition amplitude scales approximately as A2e−π ˜∆2  , which decreases exponentially with ˜∆, as shown in Fig. 3. Thus, to 1 ˜F1  achieve an O(1) transition amplitude, the amplitude A must increase exponentially with ˜∆. Based on these discus- sions, it is evident that “time-dependent resonance” provide an efficient mechanism for enabling state operations in the nearly-adiabatic regime.   From the above, it was found that “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonian induces state transitions with small amplitudes in the nearly-adiabatic regime. Next, we numerically demonstrate that “time-dependent resonant” Hamil- tonian provides optimal control for state transitions.   We consider a two-level system Hamiltonian as follows:   H(t) = u(t)σz + ∆σx,   t ∈ [−T, T ], u(t) ∈ [u−, u+].   We set the initial state as the ground state of u−σz + ∆σx, and the goal is to obtain the ground state of HC := u+σz + ∆σx at the final time T . The problem of finding the control u(t) that minimizes the expectation value of HC   at the final time can be formulated as a minimization of the following functional [9]:   J[|x(t)⟩ , ⟨k(t)| , u(t)] = ⟨x(T )| HC |x(T )⟩   where the final state |x(T )⟩ is not fixed. The initial control before optimization is denoted as u0(t) and we assume u0(t) = vn+1tn. We derive the dimensionless quantities in the same manner as discussed previously and use them in the subsequent discussion. More detailed optimal control conditions and experimental results are summarized in [29].   We conduct numerical experiments for the problem. Below, we set ˜u+ = −˜u− = τ n   f . The results of the optimal control for ˜∆ = 1/2, τf = 5, n = 1 are shown in Fig. 4. As clear from the figure, the optimal control ˜uopt(τ ) oscillates around the initial control ˜u0(τ ). In particular, the amplitude near τ = 0 is the largest and significantly affects the dynamics.   The optimal and analytically derived amplitudes of oscillation ˜αopt for adiabaticity and large time are compared in Fig. 5. In the nearly-adiabatic regime and long-time limit, it is found that the numerically determined optimal control coincides with the “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonian. On the other hand, when the long-time limit does not hold, it becomes necessary to revise the derivation. Such a scenario is particularly important in cases involving time dependencies similar to those in quantum annealing, as discussed in previous studies [9, 20]. The analysis of cases where the long-time limit does not hold, including through the context of this scenario, is discussed in detail in [29].   The above analysis corresponds to the case where the initial control has n = 1. Next, we will examine the case of n = 3. In this case, the analytically derived “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonian consisted of a sum of three oscillations. A comparison between this analytical solution and the specific numerical optimal control is shown in 6. As can be seen from this figure, the analytically derived control and the numerically determined optimal control agree well.   Finally, let us comment on the extension to multi-level systems. While the method using “time-dependent reso- nance” is effective for controlling transitions between two states, it may not be suitable for controlling transitions among three or more states. Therefore, if the transition probability to the second or higher excited states is initially zero in free dynamics, the “time-dependent resonance” may serve as the optimal control. However, if the transition probability to the second or higher excited states is non-zero, while the transition to the first excited state can be minimized, it cannot be considered the optimal control for maximizing the probability of remaining in the ground state [29].   In this study, we analyzed control using “time-dependent resonant” Hamiltonians, which includes an oscillatory term with a time-dependent energy gap as its frequency, applied to a simple yet nontrivial two-level system. Through the analysis of the dynamics, we concluded that “time-dependent resonance” is effective for state control and confirmed that it is consistent with the results of numerical optimal control calculations. While we considered control to suppress state transitions, we believe that this approach could also play a significant role in cases such as the dynamically assisted Schwinger model, where the cost is defined by the excitation rate of the state [34].   This work was supported by Japan’s MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program under Grant No. JPMXS0120319794   In this section, we briefly summarize the results of [35]. The exact WKB analysis was originally discussed as an analytical method for second-order differential equations. Similarly, it can also be applied to the Schr¨odinger equation of a two-level system, especially in the adiabatic regime. Here, we consider the following form of the Hamiltonian:   The eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are expressed as:   where we assume E+(τ ) > E−(τ ) ∀τ ∈ R and no degeneracy occurs. In this method, the turning points, where the energy becomes zero, play a crucial role. For simplicity, we consider the case where there is only one turning point in the upper half-plane:   where Im τc > 0. Furthermore, the set satisfying the following equation is called the Stokes line:   Each time the Stokes line is crossed, the solution is considered to change discretely (though exponentially small). The solution of the Schr¨odinger equation is expressed as:   Rewriting it in the following form:   ai(τ ) |Ei(τ )⟩ .   Additionally, the following states under the adiabatic approximation are the WKB solutions:   Now, when crossing the Stokes line counterclockwise where |ψA,−(τ, τc, η)⟩ dominates, the solution changes as follows:   |ψA,+(τ, τ0, η)⟩ |ψA,−(τ, τ0, η)⟩   i cot θ(τc)   Conversely, when crossing the Stokes line counterclockwise where |ψA,+(τ, τc, η)⟩ dominates, the solution changes as follows:   |ψA,+(τ, τ0, η)⟩ |ψA,−(τ, τ0, η)⟩   1 i tan θ(τc)   |ψA,+(τ, τ0, η)⟩ |ψA,−(τ, τ0, η)⟩   Using this, for example, in the case of the nonlinear LZSM model, the WKB solution changes as follows:   |ψA,+(τ, τ0, η)⟩ |ψA,−(τ, τ0, η)⟩   |ψA,+(τ, τ0, η)⟩ |ψA,−(τ, τ0, η)⟩   leads to   (−1)ke−i  τr,k   It should be noted that this can be regarded as an adiabatic-impulse approximation in the nearly-adiabatic regime [30, 31]. Typically, in the adiabatic-impulse approximation, the time of non-adiabatic transitions is determined as the moment where the energy gap becomes 0 when the off-diagonal component becomes zero. However, in the nearly- adiabatic regime, it is found that even moments without energy level crossing can be considered as part of the impulse region.   The condition for the variation of the functional (8) to be zero is given by   d dt d dt   |x(t)⟩ = H(t) |x(t)⟩ ,   |k(t)⟩ = H(t) |k(t)⟩ ,   |k(T )⟩ = HC |x(T )⟩ ,   0 = −i ⟨k(t)| σz |x(t)⟩ + c.c.,   From Eq. (B1), |x(t)⟩ represents the time-evolved state from the specified initial state. On the other hand, from Eqs. (B2) and (B3), |k(t)⟩ is a (non-normalized) state with a boundary condition defined at the final time. Using these states, the problem is to optimize the control u(t) to satisfy Eq. (B4).   The dimensionless equations are as follows:   ˜u(τ )σz + ˜∆σx   τ ∈ [−vT, vT ] =: [τ0, τf ].   Next, we compare the behavior of the optimal control as it approaches the adiabatic limit. The results are shown in Fig. 7. As ˜∆ increases and approaches the adiabatic limit, the oscillation amplitude of the optimal control decreases. This reflects the fact that as the system approaches the adiabatic limit, the dynamics under the initial control ˜u0(τ ) alone yield a sufficiently high probability of obtaining the ground state.   Additionally, the plots of ˜uopt(τ ) − ˜u0(τ ) for these controls are shown in Fig. 8. The dashed lines in Fig. 8 represent   the fitting results using   0 E1(s)ds E1(τ )   It can be observed that in the adiabatic region, ˜u(τ ) − ˜u0(τ ) is well approximated by the fitting function ˜ufit(τ ). Notably, ˜α is always positive, indicating its role in suppressing nonadiabatic transitions at the time when the energy gap is smallest.   In quantum annealing, the following form is often assumed [9, 20]:   H(t) = ∆x(1 − u(t))Hx + ∆zu(t)Hz,   We discuss how the analysis changes in cases where both Hamiltonians depend on time. As discussed below, in such cases, the transition amplitude over a finite time interval without oscillations plays a crucial role.   Here, we consider the following single qubit Hamiltonian:   H(t) = ∆x(1 − u(t))σx + ∆zu(t)σz,   Assuming ∆x, ∆z > 0, the initial state at t = 0 is |−⟩, and we aim to compute the probability of obtaining |1⟩ at the final time t = T . First, we assume the initial control u0(t) = (t/T )n = τ n and consider the dimensionless Hamiltonian Hn(τ ) = T ∆x(1 − τ n)σx + T ∆zτ nσz = ¯∆x(1 − τ n)σx + ¯∆zτ nσz.   We denote the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian as |E±,n(τ )⟩. Calculating the positive energy eigenvalue and the turning points, we obtain   Here, the signs ± and the indices k, k′ correspond as follows. The sign + corresponds to turning points in the upper half-plane, and the sign − corresponds to turning points in the lower half-plane. Additionally, the index k is taken in order of the real parts, from the largest to the smallest, such that k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1. The Stokes diagram for this case is shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. For n = 1, we find   and it can be seen that the number of τr to be considered is the same as in the case of an infinite time interval. For n ̸= 1, the Stokes diagram changes compared to the case of infinite time interval. This indicates that only certain Stokes lines need to be considered in the dynamics due to the finite time interval. For example, for n = 3, as seen in Fig. 11, it can be observed that the number of τr,k to be considered has decreased to one. Accordingly, ˜α1 = ˜α2 = 0.   Next, consider the Hamiltonian with an additional control term:   Hn(τ ) = Hn(τ ) + − ¯∆xσx + ¯∆zσz   cn(τ ) = Hn(τ ) + Hc(τ ),   ˜An,k(τ ) sin (φn(τ, τr,k) + ξk)   Denote the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian as |En,±(τ )⟩, and let Un(τ ) represent the time evolution operator under this Hamiltonian, with Un(τ ) representing the evolution operator under Hn(τ ). Using perturbative expansion in the Furry picture, we obtain:   Un(τ ) ≃ Un(τ ) − iUn(τ )   n (s)Hc(s)Un(s).   The probability amplitude for transitions is then given as:   ⟨En,+(τf )| Un(τf ) |En,−(τ0)⟩ −   We consider finite time intervals, so both first and second term are complex. The phase ξk is adjusted to ensure the cancellation of differences between the terms. Moreover, not all turning points contribute to the dynamics due to the finite time interval, and the oscillatory components ˜αk corresponding to irrelevant turning points are expected to vanish.   Finally, we verify whether the above considerations hold and whether the chosen control is optimal in the adiabatic regime for n = 1, 3. From Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, it can be seen that the control using “time-dependent resonance” in the nearly-adiabatic regime matches the optimal control. Thus, it is found that state control using “time-dependent resonance” is effective even for optimal control with a finite time interval.   This paper has mainly dealt with two-level systems, but here we will consider how the previously discussed “time-   dependent resonance” can be applied to the control of many-level systems.   We first measure the difference between the ground energy and the excitation energy, and define this function as   f (t). If it can be reduced to a two-level system, we have:   Thus, we can obtain:   Assuming an initial control of u0(t) = t/T = τ , we consider the dimensionless Hamiltonian:   H (τ ) = T ∆x(1 − τ )Hx + T ∆zτ Hprob = ¯∆x(1 − τ )Hx + ¯∆zτ Hprob   Let the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian be denoted as |En(τ )⟩. Let the difference between the ground energy and the first excitation energy be denoted as δE (τ ). For simplicity, assume that the crossing point between the Stokes lines and the real axis for δE (τ ) is unique, and let this time be denoted as τr.   Next, consider the Hamiltonian with the added control term:   H(τ ) = H (τ ) + − ¯∆xHx + ¯∆zHprob    c(τ ) = H (τ ) + Hc(τ ).   Let the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian be denoted as |En(τ )⟩. Let the time evolution operator for this Hamiltonian be denoted as U (τ ), and the time evolution operator for H (τ ) be denoted as U (τ ). We then have:   ⟨E1(τf )| U (τf ) |E0(τ0)⟩ ≃ ⟨E1(τf )| U (τf ) |E0(τ0)⟩   dsc(s)e−i  τf   Here, we define:   −˜α f1(s)(δE (s))2 sin f1(s) := ⟨E1(s)| − ¯∆xHx + ¯∆zHprob   δE (s′)ds′ + ξ   Then, we can write:   ⟨E1(τf )| U (τf ) |E0(τ0)⟩ ≃ ⟨E1(τf )| Un(τf ) |E0(τ0)⟩ −   By adjusting ˜α and ξ, it is possible to suppress the transition to the first excited state. However, it is unlikely that this control can suppress transitions to higher energy levels. The optimal control that can be numerically determined can suppress transitions to these higher levels as well, leading to more complex control. As discussed in prior research [9, 20], it has been numerically confirmed that although the amplitude becomes a complex function, the phase is governed by  s δE (s′)ds′. This suggests that optimal control in the adiabatic regime may be analytically derived for many-level systems as well.",

The majority of current methods for SDR focus on\nthe setting of independent observations, while the few techniques that have been developed\nfor clustered data assume the linear transformation is identical across clusters. In this article,\nwe introduce random effects SDR, where cluster-specific random effect central subspaces are\nassumed to follow a distribution on the Grassmann manifold, and the random effects distribu-\ntion is characterized by a covariance matrix that captures the heterogeneity between clusters\nin the SDR process itself. We incorporate random effect SDR within a model-based inverse\nregression framework. Specifically, we propose a random effects principal fitted compo-\nnents model, where a two-stage algorithm is used to estimate the overall fixed effect central\nsubspace, and predict the cluster-specific random effect central subspaces. We demonstrate\nthe consistency of the proposed estimators, while simulation studies demonstrate the su-\nperior performance of the proposed approach compared to global and cluster-specific SDR\napproaches. We also present extensions of the above model to handle mixed predictors,\ndemonstrating how random effects SDR can be achieved in the case of mixed continuous\nand binary covariates.

         " Random effects model-based sufficient dimension reduction for independent clustered data   School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney, Australia Francis K.C. Hui † Research School of Finance, Actuarial Studies and Statistics, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia   Keywords: exponential family, Grassmann manifold, longitudinal data, mixed models, principal fitted components, random effects   Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR, Ma and Zhu, 2013; Li, 2018) is a class of statistical meth-   ods that assume the outcome depends on covariates via a small number of their linear combina-   tions. These linear combinations are known as sufficient predictors and retain the full regression   information between the response and all the covariates, thereby overcoming the curse of dimen-   sionality. Since the pioneering work of Li (1991), a vast literature has developed on different   approaches to SDR, from inverse-moment-based and regression-based methods (e.g., Li, 1991;   Cook and Forzani, 2008), forward regression (e.g., Xia et al., 2002), to semiparametric techniques   (Ma and Zhu, 2012). Much research has also been done to combine SDR with various aspects of   statistical inference e.g., penalized SDR for high-dimensional sparse dimension reduction (Lin   et al., 2018; Nghiem et al., 2023), and SDR in the presence of error-prone covariates (Chen and   Yi, 2022; Nghiem et al., 2024).   The vast majority of the SDR methods focus on the setting of independent observations. By con-   trast, the adaptation of SDR to clustered data settings remains relatively underdeveloped, even   though such data are common found in disciplines such as medical, social, and ecological and   environmental studies (Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2009). For independent clustered or longitu-   dinal data settings, the most common method of statistical analysis involves fitting mixed effects   models or variations thereof (Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2009; Fitzmaurice et al., 2012), which   combine fixed effects that are identical across clusters with random effects representing cluster-   specific deviations away from the overall fixed effects. The random effects are assumed to come   from some common (typically normal) distribution with a zero mean/location vector and a covari-   ance matrix, the latter of which characterizes the degree of heterogeneity across clusters. Mixed   effect models can thus be seen as a balance between a global fixed effects model that ignores   all clustering in the data, and a cluster-specific fixed effects model that ignores possible shared   information across clusters.   Among the few research that have been done on SDR for independent clustered data, all have   effectively assumed a global fixed effects model approach to dimension reduction, i.e., the di-   rection of the linear transformation is identical across all the clusters. For example, Bi and Qu   (2015) and Xu et al. (2016) employed a marginal estimation equation approach where working   correlation matrices were included to account for temporal correlations arising within clusters for   longitudinal data, while Hui and Nghiem (2022) proposed a finite mixture approach where the   mixture proportions are modeled as known function of sufficient predictors and random effects   are added to the mixture means to account for within cluster correlations. Global fixed effects   SDR is also assumed in Pfeiffer et al. (2021) and Song et al. (2023), who developed methods for   matrix-valued predictors formed from the collection of all repeated measurements of covariates   corresponding to each cluster. We also acknowledge the connected literature on single index   models and variations thereof for independent clustered and longitudinal data (e.g., Pang and   Xue, 2012; Tian and Qiu, 2023); all of these works again assume a global fixed effects model   approach to dimension reduction. Such an assumption of the same direction for the linear trans-   formation across all clusters may be restrictive, as it does not allow for heterogeneity between   clusters when it comes to the SDR process itself.   In this article, we introduce the idea of random effects sufficient dimension reduction for inde-   pendent clustered data, where heterogeneity across clusters of the dimension reduction operation   is induced by assuming that the linear transformation of the covariates for each cluster is drawn   from a common distribution. This leads to an overall, fixed effects sufficient dimension reduc-   tion, and cluster-specific random effects sufficient dimension reduction representing deviations   away from this. Like other mixed models, we characterize the degree of heterogeneity in the   sufficient dimension operation by a random effects covariance matrix. One immediate challenge   in defining random effects SDR is that the direction of the linear transformation of the covari-   ates is not unique, since it is invariant to any orthogonal rotation. That is, similar to other SDR   techniques, the estimation target is the subspace spanned by the columns of the linear transforma-   tion for each cluster, which in our setting is both the overall fixed effect central subspace and the   cluster-specific random effect central subspaces. Because all these central subspaces are elements   on a Grassmann manifold, then one approach would be to define the random effects distribution   on this manifold. However, sufficiently flexible distributions on this manifold typically contain   intractable normalizing constants, and their parameters are not easily interpretable (e.g., Scealy   and Wood, 2019, 2022).   To overcome the above challenge, we propose to construct the distribution of cluster-specific ran-   dom effect central subspaces as the image of an exponential mapping of a distribution defined   on a tangent space of the Grassmann manifold (Srivastava and Klassen, 2016) at an overall fixed   effect central subspace; we will define it formally in Section 2. This modeling approach has the   advantage that the tangent subspace is a vector space, meaning we can assume a random effects   distribution defined on the corresponding Euclidean space e.g., a matrix normal distribution with   a covariance matrix characterizing the heterogeneity of sufficient predictors between clusters.   After defining a distribution for the cluster-specific central subspaces in this manner, we incor-   porate this into the framework of model-based inverse regression models for SDR, first via the   principal fitted components (PFC) model (Cook and Forzani, 2008) for continuous predictors,   and then through exponential family inverse models (Bura and Forzani, 2015; Bura et al., 2022)   to handle mixed predictors e.g., longitudinal data with both continuous and binary predictors.   To our knowledge, this article is the first in the literature to establish such a concept of random   effects sufficient dimension reduction, let alone embed in within the framework of model-based   inverse regression.   For estimation, we propose a two-stage algorithm where we first use a global fixed effects SDR to   estimate a parameter of the overall fixed effects subspace, and then apply the Monte-Carlo Expec-   tation Maximization algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990) to estimate the remaining parameters and   predict the cluster-specific random effect central subspaces. Focusing on the random effects PFC   model, we establish the consistency of the proposed estimators under general conditions when   the number of clusters goes to infinity, while simulation studies show that our proposed random   effects SDR methods perform strongly compared with global fixed effects inverse regression   models that ignore the heterogeneity between clusters, and cluster-specific fixed effects inverse   regression models that do not borrow strength across clusters. Finally, we apply the proposed   model to perform random effects SDR on a longitudinal, mixed predictor dataset studying the   relationship between female life expectancy and various socioeconomic variables across differ-   ent countries. Results show that the fixed effect central subspace is driven mostly by log income   per capita, sex ratio and infant mortality, while children per woman and income inequality drive   heterogeneity between the country-specific random effects central subspaces.   The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the general concept of   random effect central subspaces. Section 3 proposes the random effects PFC (or RPFC) model   for independent clustered data with continuous responses along with a two-step estimation pro-   cedure. The consistency of the proposed estimators for the RPFC model is established in Section   4, while Section 5 compares the proposed model with fixed effects SDR models via a simulation   study. Section 6 presents extensions of the random effects PFC model to handle mixed continu-   ous and binary predictors, establishing the sufficient reduction in this cases, along with a second   numerical study demonstrating its strong empirical performance. Section 7 applies the proposed   model to perform random effects SDR on longitudinal socioeconomic data, while Section 8 dis-   cusses some potential avenues for future research.   Consider a set of n independent clusters, such that for cluster i = 1, . . . , n we let yij denote the   jth measurement of the response for j = 1, . . . , mi, and Xij denote a corresponding vector of p   covariates. For each cluster, SDR implies the response only depends on the covariates via a small   number of their linear combinations,   where Γ   i ∈ Rp×d with structural dimension d < p for i = 1, . . . , n. Note we assume the same   structural dimension d for all clusters; see Section 8 for a discussion on how could be extended.   More importantly, model (1) allows the directions Γ   i to potentially vary from cluster to another,   with the idea being that the Γ   i’s represent deviations from some overall direction Γ   0, which we   formally define later. Without loss of generality, assume each Γ   i is a semi-orthogonal matrix,   i = Id for i = 1, . . . , n. Similar to standard SDR, only the subspaces spanned by each Γ   denoted here as [Γ   i] (and analogously [Γ   0]) are unique and identifiable; all of these are points on   the Grassmann manifold Gr(p, d).   If the spaces [Γ   i] are identical for all n clusters i.e., [Γ   0] for all i, then there is no het-   erogeneity between clusters in terms of the sufficient dimension reduction process. As reviewed   in Section 1, much of the current literature on SDR for independent clustered and longitudinal   data has been developed under such an assumption. On the other hand, if the central subspaces   i] are completely different from another, then in practice one could identify the cluster-specific   central subspace separately with no information being shared across clusters. In this case, there   is no borrowing of strength across clusters in the dimension reduction operation.   As a balance between the above two situations then, and analogous to other mixed models for   clustered and longitudinal data, we propose that the cluster-specific central subspaces [Γ   a common distribution on the Grassmann manifold. Specifically, we assume all [Γ   i] are obtained   from an exponential mapping of an overall fixed effect central subspace [Γ   locity vector Vi on the tangent space T[Γ   0] Gr(p, d) of the Grassman manifold at [Γ   0]. For the   remainder of this article, we will refer to [Γ   i] as the cluster-specific random effect central sub-   space for the ith cluster, and [Γ   0] as the overall fixed effect central subspace. A review of the   tangent space and exponential mapping on a Grassmann manifold is provided in Supplemental   Material S1, but to summarize we assume that   0](Vi), Vi ∈ T[Γ   where for a given [U] ∈ Gr(p, d), the exponential map Exp[U] transfers a point V ∈ T[U] Gr(p, d)   to [ U] ∈ Gr(p, d). As an aside, note using the exponential mapping assumes the cluster-specific   central subspaces [Γ   i] are not too far from the fixed effect central subspace [Γ   0], specifically,   i]) < π/2 where the distance measure is based on the Riemann metric. A sufficient   condition for this constraint is that the smallest singular value of the d × d matrix Γ⊤   i is strictly   greater than cos−1{π/(2d−1/2)} e.g, for d = 1 the two bases Γ   i are not orthogonal   to each other; see Supplementary Material S1 for further detail. We regard such a condition   as being consistent with the general notion that for independent clustered data, the random ef-   fects represent cluster-specific deviations not too far from the overall fixed effects response. That   is, the condition on the exponential mapping is consistent with the notion of borrowing shared   information across clusters as part of the SDR operation, with all the [Γ   i]’s belong to a local   neighborhood of [Γ   Next, we assume a random effects distribution for the Vi’s, whose covariance matrix character-   izes the variability of central subspace among the clusters. Since Vi ∈ T[Γ   0] Gr(p, d), then Vi is   orthogonal to Γ   0 and so any multivariate distribution imposed on Vi should only have a non-zero   0]. In this article, we examine one such distribution that   satisfies these requirements, namely the singular matrix-valued normal (MN) distribution with   zero mean vector and two covariance matrices Σ and Ω that characterize the covariance among   the rows and columns of Vi, respectively. Let, Vi ∼ MNp×d(0, Σ, Ω), where the dimensions of   Σ and Ω are p × p and d × d, respectively, where the orthogonality between Vi and Γ   0 implies   that Σ is also orthogonal to Γ   0, and Σ has rank at most p − d. The joint density of Vi, defined on   the subspace V⊤ i   0 = 0, is then given by   where Λ denotes an (p − d) × (p − d) diagonal matrix with elements containing the non-zero   eigenvalues of Σ, Σ− denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse of Σ, and tr(·) and | · | denote the trace   and determinant operators, respectively. Based on the above formulation, we have the following   result whose proof is given in Supplementary Material S2.   Lemma 2.1. If the density function of Vi is symmetric about zero, then [E(Γ   the expectation is taken with regards to a uniform probability measure on Rp×d.   The above implies that by assuming a degenerate MN distribution, [Γ   0] is the mean direction   across all n clusters and aligns with its interpretation as the overall fixed effect central subspace.   Note for any scalar s > 0, we have p(Vi; Σ, Ω) = p(Vi; sΣ, s−1Ω). That is, the covariance   matrices Σ and Ω are only identifiable up to a scale. Without loss of generality then, we set Ω   to be a correlation matrix. Furthermore, in this article we will restrict Ω = Id such that any two   dimensions in the central subspace can vary independently from one another, and the variability   of the central subspace among the clusters is solely characterized by Σ. We leave the exploration   of more complex structures of Ω for future research.   We conclude this section with a visual illustration of the cluster-specific random effect central   subspaces based on the approach proposed above, for the simplest case with d = 1 and p = 3   i.e., a one-dimensional central subspace representing dimension reduction from three dimensions.   In both panels of Figure 1, we set Γ   0 = (1, 0, 0)⊤ and generate n = 50 points (each one repre-   senting a cluster) Vi = K Vi, where K = I3 − Γ   Γ⊤ 0 and each Vi is sampled from the trivariate   normal distribution N3(0, Σ). This data generation process ensures each Vi is orthogonal to Γ   and the corresponding covariance for Vi is given by Σ = KΣK. The left and right panels then   correspond to a particular choice for ˜Σ, namely an independence and an exchangeable struc-   ture. Finally, the corresponding Γ   i is obtained by applying equation (2) to each Vi. From Figure   1, we see that although both panels have the same overall fixed effect central subspace, differ-   ent covariances on the tangent space lead to different variability patterns in the manifold. That   is, the covariance matrix Σ acts as a surrogate measure, in Euclidean space, for characterizing   the heterogeneity among the cluster-specific random effect central subspaces. The left panel is   based on a covariance matrix with equal variance values of 0.3 on the diagonal, where the cor-   responding (Monte-Carlo estimate of the) Fr´echet variance on the Grassmann manifold is 0.68   (the Fr´echet variance is an explicit quantification of the heterogeneity between clusters in terms   of their Grassmann manifolds). Meanwhile, the right panel has slightly larger variance values   of 0.5 on the diagonal, where the corresponding Fr´echet variance on the Grassmann manifold is   In the random effects SDR model formulations below, we treat [Γ   0] and Σ as unknown parameters   which need to be estimated.   3 A random effects principal fitted components model   We formulate an approach for performing random effects SDR by embedding the idea of cluster-   specific random effect central subspaces within the model-based inverse regression framework.   Figure 1: Visual illustration of cluster-specific random effect central subspaces based on the tangent space approach. In each panel, the overall fixed effect central subspace [Γ 0] is represented by the red dot, while the planes on the top row represent the tangent space T[Γ 0]. Each point on the tangent plane is given by Vi ∼ MN(0, Σ, Id), while each green point on the sphere below represents the corresponding Γ i obtained via the exponential map in (2). The left panel sets Σ 1K with Σ 1 = KΣ 2K where Σ   2 has an exchangeable structure with variance 0.5 and covariance 0.20.   0 , while the right panel sets Σ Γ⊤   1 = 0.3I3 and K = Ip − Γ   We start with the case of continuous predictors, and in Section 6 we will extend this to the mixed   predictor setting.   Let {(Xij, yij); i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , mi} denote our set of observations, where N = ∑n   denotes the sample size and the n clusters are assumed to be independent. Given an explicit   parametric form for the random effects distribution of the cluster-specific central subspaces as   defined in the preceding section, it is natural to adopt a model-based inverse-regression model   for random effects SDR here. Compared with traditional sliced inverse regression and other   inverse moments-based techniques (Li, 1991), a major advantage of using model-based inverse-   regression methods is that they result in an explicit objective function for the parameters of the   central subspace, and subsequently inherit desirable properties and practical tools from general   likelihood theory e.g., for prediction and model selection as we will utilize later on in Sections 3.1   and 5. For independent clustered/longitudinal data specifically, model-based inverse-regression   methods facilitate an appropriate conditional likelihood function of the cluster-specific central   subspaces which, when combined with the ideas of Section 2, can be used to construct a formal   marginal likelihood function based on integrating out random effect distribution.   With continuous predictors, and inspired by the work of Cook and Forzani (2008), we propose   the random effect principal fitted components (RPFC) model as follows   iid∼ MN(0, Σ, Id), ΣΓ   where µi ∈ Rp denotes the conditional mean vector for the ith cluster, ∆ is a common p ×   p unstructured covariance matrix, and vijy ∈ Rd is an unknown function of yij. In (4a), the   term µi plays the role of cluster-specific intercept terms, and are treated as fixed parameters   (similar to fixed effect models in econometrics e.g., Hsiao et al., 2002). To obtain the term on   the right hand side of (4a), we follow Cook and Forzani (2008); Cook and Li (2009) and set   , where C ∈ Rd×r has rank d ≤ min(p, r) and fijy ∈ Rr is a known   function of yij often chosen to be a reasonably flexible set of basis functions of yij e.g., piecewise   polynomials. Without loss of generality, we assume that for each cluster E(fyij) = 0 for all   i = 1, . . . , n; in practice, we center the basis functions within each cluster before conducting the   analysis. Note also the parameters C and ∆ in our formulation are constrained to be the same   across clusters: while it is possible to vary them by cluster, empirically we found that doing so   often leads to overfitting and general instability in estimation. Finally, the εij’s are assumed to be   independent of Γ   Turning to (4b), using the distribution introduced in Section 2, we assume all the Γ   0] on the Grassmann manifold. With this formula-   tion, Proposition 3.1 establishes the forms of the cluster-specific and overall fixed effect central   subspaces in the RPFC model.   Proposition 3.1. For the RPFC model (4a)–(4b), the cluster-specific central subspace for the   ith cluster is given by [Θ   i], and the overall fixed effect central subspace is given by   The above results implies that within each cluster, there is no loss of information of yij when   transforming p-dimensional predictors Xij to d < p dimensional sufficient predictors Γ⊤ i   Furthermore, from equations (4a)–(4b), the marginal log-likelihood function of the RPFC model   can be shown to be   N(Xij; µi + Γ   log ℓi(Γ   where the integral is over all points on the tangent space T[Γ   Proposition 3.2. For any orthogonal matrix A ∈ Rd×d such that AA⊤ = A⊤A = Id, we have   0, µi, C, ∆, Σ) = ℓ(Γ   0A, µi, A⊤C, ∆, Σ).   For the RPFC model then, the above proposition implies only the parameters µi, ∆, Σ are identi-   fiable, while the marginal likelihood is invariant to transformations of Γ   0 and C. However, even   though Γ   0 is not identifiable its span [Γ   0] is since it is invariant to any orthogonal rotation Γ   In turn, the cluster-specific central subspaces [Γ   i] are also identifiable.   3.1 Two-stage estimation procedure   One challenge with fitting the RPFC model in equations (4a)–(4b) is that while Γ   0 is not identi-   fiable, the random effects covariance Σ is orthogonal to every vector belonging to [Γ   0]. In other   words, the parameter space for Σ depends upon the value of another parameter, posing issues   with estimating Γ   0 and Σ jointly. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage procedure where   we first compute a consistent estimator of [Γ   0], and then we estimate the remaining parameters   conditioned on this. Note the latter implies the estimated cluster-specific central subspaces will   be in the local neighborhood of the estimated [ ˆΓ   0], consistent with the discussion below equation   (2). Throughout the developments, we assume the structural dimension d is fixed and known; we   address the issue of choosing d via information criterion in Supplementary Material S4.   In the first stage, we estimate [Γ   0] by fitting a so-called global PFC model (GPFC) which ignores   the clustering, Xij | yij = µ + Γ ˜βfijy + ˜εij, εij ∼ Np(0, ˜∆). That is, we maximize the likelihood   function   Xij − µ − ΓCfijy   Xij − µ − ΓCfijy   the details of which can be found in Cook and Forzani (2008). Let the resulting maximum   likelihood estimator be denoted by Γ   0. We emphasize that GPFC only consistently estimates [Γ   and not the overall fixed effect central subspace ∆−1[Γ   0]. Moreover, equation (5) does not offer   predictions of the cluster-specific central subspaces.   0, then in the second stage of the estimation procedure we begin by removing the cluster-   specific intercepts µi (which are regarded as nuisance parameters) by subtracting each observa-   tion from its cluster mean in equation (4a). This leads to a revised form of the RPFC model:   j=1 fijy, and   the errors are defined as ϵij = εij − m−1   )∆) for i = 1, . . . , n and   j = 1, . . . , mi. Next, observe that ∑mi   j=1 Zij = 0 and so it suffices to form the likelihood function   based on (mi − 1) observations for each cluster. Moreover, the conditional covariance of any pair   ∆ for j, j′ = 1, . . . , mi and j ̸= j′. With this in mind, let yi = (yi1, . . . , yimi   denote the full vector of responses for the ith cluster, and Zi be the p × (mi − 1) matrix whose   jth column is given by Zij. Similarly, define Hi as the r × (mi − 1) matrix whose jth col-   umn is given by hijy. Conditional on Γ   i and yi then, Zi follows a matrix normal distribution   iCHi, ∆, Li), where Li = Imi−1 − m−1   Jmi where Jmi is an mi × mi   matrix of ones. The resulting complete data log-likelihood of the centered RFPC model, given   0, is then defined as   [log {MN(Zi; Γ   iCHi, ∆, Li)} + log {MN(Vi; 0, Σ, Id)}] =   0 is implicit in the construction of each Γ   Ψ = {C⊤, vech(∆)⊤, vech(Σ)⊤}⊤ with vech(·) being the half-vectorization operator.   With the above setup, the second stage of the estimation procedure algorithm then uses a Monte-   Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM, Wei and Tanner, 1990) algorithm to estimate the re-   maining parameters. We provide details of this in Supplementary Material S3, but briefly we iter-   ate (until convergence) between an E-step which involves using Monte-Carlo integration to com-   pute the Q-function as Q(Ψ; Ψ(0)) = ∑n    ℓci(Ψ)p(Vi; Zi, yi, Ψ(0)) dVi, where p(Vi; Zi, yi, Ψ(0))   generically denotes the conditional distribution of the random effects given the observed data and   current estimates, and the M-step where we update the remaining parameters in the RPFC model   as Ψ(1) = arg maxΨ Q(Ψ; Ψ(0)) via a series of largely closed-form conditional updates.   Let Ψ = {C⊤, vech(∆)⊤, vech(Σ)⊤}⊤ denote the estimator of Ψ upon convergence of the two-   stage estimation procedure. Then the estimate of the overall fixed effect central subspace is given   0]. Furthermore, we can predict the cluster-specific random effect central   subspaces as follows: for the ith cluster, we first compute a prediction of Vi on the tangent 0]Gr(p, d) as the mean of the conditional distribution Vi =  Vi p(Vi; Xij, yi, Ψ); see   space T[Γ   Supplementary Material S3 for how this can be computed efficiency post-estimation. We then   obtain a prediction as Γ   0]( Vi) and [ Θ   i], for i = 1, . . . , n. While it is   possible to use other predictors e.g., the mode or median of p(Vi; Xij, yi, Ψ), in our empirical   study we experimented with several choices and found that using the mean of the conditional   distribution tended to be the most accurate.   4 Asymptotic theory for the RPFC model   In this section, we establish the consistency of the proposed estimators for the identifiable param-   eters in the RPFC model, in a setting where the number of clusters n → ∞ and the cluster size   mi is finite and bounded for all i = 1, . . . , n. Let Ψ∗ = (Γ∗⊤   0 , C∗⊤, vech(∆∗)⊤, vech(Σ∗)∗⊤)   denote the true parameter value of Γ   0, C, ∆ and Σ from (4a)–(4b). We require the following   regularity conditions.   matrix, when N → ∞.   Condition C2. Σxx = N−1 ∑n   matrix when N → ∞.   f f , where Σ   f f is a r × r positive definite   p → Σxx, where Σxx is a p × p positive definite   Conditions 4.1 and 4.2 are mild since they essentially require Xij and fyij to have finite (marginal)   variances. We then have the following following result:   Theorem 4.1. Assume Conditions C1 and C2 are satisfied. Then [Γ   Note Theorem 4.1 only requires the total sample size N → ∞, which is obviously satisfied when   the number of clusters n → ∞. It establishes the consistency of [Γ   0] obtained from fitting the   GPFC model in the first stage of the estimation procedure.   Next, we establish consistency of the estimated covariance matrices Σ and ∆ obtained from   the second stage of estimation procedure. The latter is essential to guarantee consistency of   the estimated overall fixed effect central subspace, while the former guarantees asymptotically   correct estimation of the heterogeneity in the cluster-specific random effect central subspaces.   Consistent with the above discussion, we will assume the true Γ∗   0 is known up to an orthogonal 0A. Consequently, let Ψ∗ = (A⊤C∗, vech(∆∗)⊤, vech(Σ∗)⊤) for any d × d orthogonal   rotation Γ∗   matrix A where s = dim(Ψ∗) = dim( ˜Ψ∗), and write the marginal log-likelihood function of   the RPFC model at the second stage of estimation as ℓ(Ψ|Γ∗   0A); see also   Proposition 3.2. Given the independence of the clusters, then without loss of generality, we   0A) satisfies the following conditions:   Condition C3. The true parameter Ψ∗ is an interior point of a compact parameter space, and   0A) is distinct as a function of Ψ.   Condition C4. For all Ψ in an open set containing Ψ∗, the s × s information matrix I(Ψ) with    ; j, k = 1, . . . , s is positive definite with all its   Condition C5. For all Ψ in an open set containing Ψ∗ and for j, k, l = 1, . . . , s, we have   l exist and there exists functions Mijk(Z1) such that   l| ≤ Mijk(Z1), where EΨ∗{Mijk(Z)} < ∞.   The above are high-level conditions analogous to those often made when studying asymptotic   properties for mixed models in general (e.g., Nie, 2007; Ibrahim et al., 2011). Note in the SDR   0 is only identifiable up to an orthogonal rotation then we need to impose condi-   Theorem 4.2. Assume Conditions C3–C5 holds. If the cluster size satisfy mi ≥ 2 for all i =   The above result establishes the consistency of the two covariance matrices characterizing the   overall fixed effect central subspace and the heterogeneity among cluster-specific random effect   central subspaces, where the requirement for mi ≥ 2 follows from the result of centering each   observation around its cluster in the second stage of the estimation procedure.   Corollary 4.1. Assume Conditions C1-C5 hold. Then ∆−1[Γ   This final result is a direct application of the Slutsky’s theorem along with Theorems 4.1 and 4.2,   and guarantees consistent estimation of the overall fixed effect central subspace.   5 Simulation study   We performed a numerical study to assess the performance of the RPFC model for random effects   SDR with continuous predictors. We simulated independent clustered data from two inverse   models as follows: for i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , mi, we first generated yij ∼ N(0, 1) and   set ∆ to be an AR(1) correlation matrix with autocorrelation parameter 0.5. Next, we generated   i following (2), with Γ   0 constructed from the QR decomposition of a random p × d matrix   whose elements are generated from the uniform distribution between (−1, 1), and the p × d   matrices Vi ∼ MN(0, Σ, Id) where Σ = KΣK and K = Ip − Γ   Γ⊤ 0 . Finally, for each cluster   and conditional Vi and Γ   0, we simulated the covariates as   Note that the structural dimensions are d = 1 and d = 2 for models M1 and M2, respectively,   and are assumed to be known in this simulation design; see Supplementary Material S4 for de-   velopments in choosing d. For both models, we set p = 7 covariates and Σ = KΣK with one   of three possible structures of Σ: a diagonal form Σ = 0.5Ip, an AR(1) form with variance set   to 0.3 and autocorrelation parameter set to 0.5, and an exchangeable structure where all diagonal   elements are set to 0.5 and all off-diagonal elements set to 0.1.   For each combination of models M1 and M2 and the three choices of Σ, the true overall fixed   effects and cluster-specific random effect central subspaces are given by [Θ   i], respectively. We set the number of clusters to n ∈ {100, 500, 1000}, and for   each n, we simulated the cluster sizes mi to be randomly integers between 10 and 15 inclusive.   We generated 200 simulated datasets per simulation setting.   For each simulated dataset, we compared the following three methods:   • The RPFC model in (4a)–(4b) assuming the random effects covariance matrix to be unstruc-   tured. That is, no assumption about the structure Σ is made except the requirement ΣΓ   • A global fixed effects PFC (GPFC) model, which ignores the clustered nature of the data and   fits a single PFC model to the entire dataset. The estimator for both the overall fixed effect   central subspace and cluster-specific central subspaces is the same here, and given by ΘGPFC   ∆GPFC−1 GPFC does not produce estimators of Σ.   0], where Γ   0 was introduced below equation (5). By construction,   • A separate fixed effects PFC (SPFC) model, which as the name suggests fits a separate PFC   model to cluster. That is, for i = 1, . . . , n we maximize   Xij − µi − Γ   Xij − µi − Γ   denote the resulting estimates for ˜∆   i, respectively. Then the   cluster-specific central subspaces from SPFC are given by [ ΘSPFC   Also, a reasonable estimator for the overall fixed effect central subspace [ ΘSPFC   ] is given by   the sample Fr´echet mean of these estimates. Finally, an estimate of Σ can be obtained by first   performing an inverse exponential mapping from [ ΘSPFC   ] to the tangent space of Gr(p, d) at   ]. Letting Vi denote the image of that map, then we compute ΣSPFC = n−1 ∑n   For all three methods, we constructed fijy from polynomial bases with degree r = 4 and centered   them within each cluster such that ∑mi   j=1 fijy = 0. We assessed the performance of the RPFC,   GPFC and SPFC models by the following three measures: (1) for estimating the overall fixed ef-   fect central subspace, we calculated the Frobenius norm of the difference between the projection   matrix based on the estimate and the projection matrix based on the corresponding true value.   That is, we computed ∥∆−1P (Γ   0)∥F, where P (B) = B(B⊤B)−1B for a generic   matrix B, and ∥ · ∥F denotes the Frobenius norm; (2) for estimating the random effects covari-   ance matrix, we computed ∥Σ − Σ∥F; (3) for predicting the cluster-specific central subspaces,   we computed the average Frobenius form across clusters, n−1 ∑n   Table 1 demonstrates the RPFC model exhibits the best overall performance across the simulation   settings considered. For estimating the overall fixed effect central subspace, SPFC produced the   poorest performance, while even though RPFC and GPFC use the same estimator for Γ   former performs better due to its superior performance at estimating ∆. The estimation errors   for both the overall fixed effect central subspace and random effect covariance matrix decreased   noticeably when the number of clusters n increased for RPFC, but not for SPFC. Turning to   the estimation of the random effects covariance matrix, RPFC consistently outperformed SPFC.   Moreover, the estimation errors for both the overall fixed effect central subspace and random   effect covariance matrix decreased noticeably when the number of clusters n increased for RPFC,   but not for SPFC. Finally, for predicting the cluster-specific central subspaces RPFC consistently   outperformed SPFC, reflecting the ability of the former approach capacity to borrow strength   Table 1: Simulation results for random effects SDR with continuous predictors. The methods compared include the RPFC, GPFC, SPFC models. Performance is assessed in terms of estimat- 0], the random effects covariance matrix ˜Σ, and pre- ing the fixed effect central subspace ∆−1[Γ dicting the cluster-specific random effect central subspaces [Θ i]. For each measure, the method/s with the lowest average Frobenius error in each row is highlighted.   across clusters in the SDR process.   In Supplementary Material S3, we performed additional simulations where we set and assume in   the fitting process an isotropic structure for Σ, with results exhibiting similar trends to those above   and the RPFC model performing best overall. Furthermore, in Supplementary Material S4 we   propose and examine several information criteria that can be computed efficiently for selecting   the structural dimension d in the RPFC model. Empirical results suggest an AIC-type criterion   constructed from an SPFC model performs reasonably well when the above simulation study was   modified such that d needed to be chosen from the candidate set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.",

LiDAR elevation metrics were statistically related to field-observed dominant height (DH). Three models were fitted to predict DH as a function of LiDAR metrics, while nine height growth models were developed using the algebraic difference approach, at a base age of 40 years, using the ordinary least squares method and mixed effects models (MEM). \nMain results: The 99th height percentile was the LiDAR metric that showed the greatest correlation with the observed DH. Its integration into a linear model was best suited to estimate DH with Adjusted Determination Coefficient (R2adj) of 0.97 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.31 m. The Hossfeld IV anamorphic model adjusted as MEM and autocorrelation corrected model showed the best performance for predicting DH growth with R2adj of 0.87 and RMSE of 2.11 m. The integration of both models into a Geographic Information System (GIS) allowed the spatially explicit construction of an accurate mosaic of the DH and site index to classify stand productivity in the study area. \nResearch highlights: Of the total area managed for timber purposes, 87% is classified as a heigh (≥31 m) and average (26 m) site index, while areas dedicated to conservation contain 13% of the area classified with low site index (≤21 m).",

         "Research on microbial communities colonizing animals has revealed that the microbiota, despite its typical containment to surfaces, influences virtually all organ systems of the host. In absence of a natural microbiota, the host’s development can be disturbed, but how developmental programs are affected by the microbiota is still poorly understood. Removing the microbiota from Hydra, a classic model animal in developmental biology, causes drastic developmental malformations and leads to polyps that temporarily lack the ability to bud. Recolonizing non-budding germfree Hydra with bacteria reverses this budding inhibition. Single-nucleus ATAC-seq detected a unique chromatin landscape associated with the non-budding phenotype. Single-cell RNA-seq and trajectory-based differential expression analysis showed that epithelial stem cell decision making is disturbed in non-budding polyps, whereby key developmental regulators are not expressed. This process is reversible by adding back bacteria. Transcriptionally silencing of one of the genes that failed to be activated in non-budding animals, GAPR1, led to polyps that have a significantly reduced budding capacity. The results show that maintaining a species-specific microbiota may enable the animal host to maintain its developmental program. Significance Statement Animal developmental programs work within the context of coevolved associations with microbes. Here, we provide mechanistic evidence of the involvement of the microbiota in maintaining the pattern formation program of Hydra with the asexual formation of buds in the lower part of the body column. We demonstrate that in the absence of bacteria both the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape is changed and that key regulatory factors are not expressed, causing changes in stem cell trajectories that result in loss of budding capacity. This study provides a new perspective on the role that microbiota plays during animal development and evolution. One Sentence Summary Microbiota interfere with Hydra’s asexual reproduction via modulating its stem cell differentiation programs.",

         "Protein engineering holds significant promise for designing proteins with customized functions, yet the vast landscape of potential mutations versus limited lab capacity constrains the discovery of optimal sequences. To address this, we present the µProtein framework, which accelerates protein engineering by combining µFormer, a deep learning model for accurate mutational effect prediction, with µSearch, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to efficiently navigate the protein fitness landscape using µFormer as an oracle. µProtein leverages single mutation data to predict optimal sequences with complex, multi-amino acid mutations through its modeling of epistatic interactions and a multistep search strategy. Except from state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, µProtein identified high-gain-of-function multi-point mutants for the enzyme β-lactamase, surpassing the highest known activity level, in wet-lab, trained solely on single mutation data. These results demonstrate µProtein’s capability to discover impactful mutations across vast protein sequence space, offering a robust, efficient approach for protein optimization.",

       "    'abstract': '<jats:p>The Pili (Canarium ovatum Engl.) tree, native to the Philippines, has been reported to have medicinal properties because of the biological and chemical properties it exhibits. This paper aimed to investigate the presence of phytochemicals, antioxidant, and anticancer activities of the ethanolic leaf extract of C. ovatum. To determine the phytochemicals, present in the extract, standard procedures for qualitative phytochemical screening were performed. The antioxidant activity of the extract was assessed in vitro using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. The anticancer activity of the extract was assessed in vitro using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay against the HCT116 cancer cell line. Phytochemical screening of C. ovatum ethanolic leaf extract detected alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, saponins, and tannins. The extract had extremely high antioxidant activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=11.44 mg/L). The MTT assay revealed moderate cytotoxic activity of the leaf extract to HCT116 cancer cell line (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=94.43 mg/L). These findings suggest that the C. ovatum ethanolic leaf extract has therapeutic potential because of the presence of beneficial phytochemicals, strong antioxidant activity, and anticancer capacity. Futher research is recommended to comprehensively evaluate the medicinal potential of Pili leaf extracts, including exploring other biological activities using various assays and employing different solvents for leaf extraction.</jats:p>',\n",
