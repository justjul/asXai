Cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to stress, plays a pivotal role in modulating this response. Its primary function is to mobilize energy, regulate inflammation, and enhance cognitive processes during acute stress. While cortisol facilitates adaptation by suppressing overactive immune responses and ensuring resource availability, its prolonged elevation can lead to detrimental effects, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive impairments. Conversely, inadequate cortisol production disrupts the bodyâ€™s ability to manage stress, resulting in conditions like fatigue, hypotension, and impaired recovery. This study explores the dynamic relationship between stress and cortisol, emphasizing how balanced cortisol levels contribute to stress resolution and homeostasis restoration. Understanding cortisolâ€™s dual role provides insights into its potential therapeutic applications for managing stress-related disorders.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Background: Recall of specific events, which is known as episodic memory, relies heavily on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Molecular and cellular processes that mediate this phenomenon are intricate and include neuronal and glial functions, signaling pathways, and synaptic reorganization. Objective: This work will address the molecular and cellular aspects of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and its role in the formation of episodic memories through processes including dendritic spine remodelling, astrocytes and microglia, and epigenetics. Methodology: Literature review of recent findings and theoretical frameworks such as Morris’s neurobiological theory of the hippocampus was done to synthesize the molecular markers, signaling pathways, and neuromodulation. Experimental data regarding the involvement of calcium signaling, synaptic tagging, and protein synthesis dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in memory formation were reviewed. Results: This paper discusses how calcium influx, CaMKII activation and CREB-mediated transcription contribute to the preservation of LTP. Dendritic spine remodeling is highlighted as a key structural process and astrocytes and microglia are identified to regulate synaptic plasticity and neural circuit function. Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation, relate synaptic activity to the expression of genes associated with memory. Conclusion: Results of this study explain the molecular and cellular mechanisms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the formation of episodic memory. These findings provide a basis for future research on potential treatment for memory related diseases and underscore the significance of molecular biology in cognitive neuroscience.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal accumulation of A and neuroinflammatory responses. Microglia are key immune cells in the central nervous system and have important regulatory functions in the control of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Microglia have both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, but the mechanism by which they protect or damage the nerve remains unclear. Here, I used an in vitro cell culture approach to investigate the role of microglia in neuroinflammation and its regulation of amyloid- peptides. The same methods were used to investigate the effect of cytokines on microglial polarization and the clearance of amyloid-. Expected conclusion: Cytokines such as IL-4 and TGF- can promote the polarization of microglia to M2 direction and enhance its anti-inflammatory effect. Pro-inflammatory factors can induce its polarization to M1 direction and aggravate the degree of neuroinflammation. Therefore, microglia can not only clear amyloid beta, but also damage the nerve and accelerate the process of Alzheimer's disease. By studying this mechanism, I will find ways to promote the large-scale conversion of microglia to M2, which will provide new directions for Alzheimer's disease research and help develop new treatments.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Brain states fluctuate between exploratory and consummatory phases of behavior. These state changes affect both internal computation and the organism’s responses to sensory inputs. Understanding neuronal mechanisms supporting exploratory and consummatory states and their switching requires experimental control of behavioral shifts and collecting sufficient amounts of brain data. To achieve this goal, we developed the ThermoMaze, which exploits the animal’s natural warmth-seeking homeostatic behavior. By decreasing the floor temperature and selectively heating unmarked areas, we observed that mice avoided the aversive state by exploring the maze and finding the warm spot. In its design, the ThermoMaze is analogous to the widely used water maze but without the inconvenience of a wet environment and, therefore, allows the collection of physiological data in many trials. We combined the ThermoMaze with electrophysiology recording, and report that spiking activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons during sharp-wave ripple events encode the position of mice. Thus, place-specific firing is not confined to locomotion and associated theta oscillations but persist during waking immobility and sleep at the same location. The ThermoMaze will allow for detailed studies of brain correlates of immobility, preparatory–consummatory transitions, and open new options for studying behavior-mediated temperature homeostasis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'To survive in dynamic environments with uncertain resources, animals must adapt their behaviour flexibly, choosing strategies such as persevering with a current choice, exploring alternatives or disengaging altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal strategies during such decisions1–5. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioural strategies such as persevering, exploring or disengaging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub that is critical for flexible switching between behavioural strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations, fibre photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behaviours, we found that the main cell types of the MRN—GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic (VGluT2+) and serotonergic neurons—have complementary functions and regulate perseverance, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons—for instance, through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus, which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN—leads to perseverative behaviour. By contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2+ neurons drives exploration. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula that conveys negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioural switchboard that is uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioural strategies. These circuits thus may also have an important role in the aetiology of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.',\n",

We report an increased AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio in frontal-cortical pyramidal neurons of layers 2–3. Silent synapses are absent, decreasing the plastic potential to convert silent NMDA to active AMPA synapses. These sleep loss changes are recovered by sleep. Sleep genes are enriched for synaptic shaping cellular components controlling glutamate synapse phenotype, overlap with autism risk genes, and are primarily observed in excitatory pyramidal neurons projecting intra-telencephalically. These genes are enriched with genes controlled by the transcription factor, MEF2c, and its repressor, HDAC4. Sleep genes can thus provide a framework within which motor learning and training occur mediated by the sleep-dependent oscillation of glutamate-synaptic phenotypes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'As the global population ages, the mechanisms underlying age-related susceptibility to delirium have attracted attention. Given the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of inflammation-related delirium, we investigated the temporal dynamics of neurobehavioral changes and microglial responses, following lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 200 μg/kg) administration in young and old male C57BL/6 mice. Although a similar illness trajectory across 48 h post-treatment (HPT) was observed in both age groups, old-LPS mice exhibited worsened delirium-like behavior. At 48 HPT, in old but not young mice, significantly decreased hippocampal neuronal activity coincided with microglial overactivation. Widespread hippocampal microglial activation was present at 3 HPT but subsided by 12 HPT in young but not old mice, indicating a generally retarded but prolonged microglial response to LPS challenge in old mice. However, for both age groups, at 3 HPT, p16INK4a-negative microglia (with low abundance in the aged brain) exhibited comparable morphological activation, which was not observed for p16INK4a-positive microglia (highly abundant in the aged brain). These results suggest that age-related susceptibility to LPS-induced delirium-like behavior accompanied by different patterns of microglial response might implicate microglial composition shifts and that optimizing microglial composition represents a promising approach to reduce vulnerability to inflammatory challenge.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The oral-gut-brain (OGB) axis is a three-way communication process that forms cognitive functions, especially learning and memory (LM) formation. Recent studies showed that the OGB axis is pivotal in efficiently forming and regulating the brain homeostasis mechanism. In this OGB axis, oral and gut commensals play a major role in the bidirectional communication with the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The dysbiosis of oral and gut commensals results in cognitive dysfunctions like cognitive decline. The present study aimed to study the effect of Escherichia coli induced oral-gut dysbiosis on cognitive memory (CM) formation with the help of a cue-based learning paradigm (CBLP). Other than CM formation, stress memory (SM) formation was also studied with the help of behavioural paradigms like predator exposure test (PET), light and dark box test (LDBT), and open field test (OFT) in naïve goldfish Carassius auratus. The results of the study proved that the OGB axis is possibly involved in the formation of CM by inhibiting stress formation in a habituated, serene environment. Behavioural responses of E. coli-infused groups showed that higher colonization/accumulation of E. coli results in the formation of cognitive decline through the release of shiga toxin (ST) metabolites. It also showed that the release of ST metabolites may disrupt gut dysbiosis through the development of gastroenteritis. Developed gastroenteritis further results in cognitive memory - decline (70-75 %) due to the long-term existence of E. coli-induced oral/gut dysbiosis. Thus, the present study stated the possible effect of E. coli shiga toxin metabolites on the development of cognitive dysfunction in a unique manner.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Topological techniques have become a popular tool for studying information flows in neural networks. In particular, simplicial homology theory is used to analyze how cognitive representations of space emerge from large conglomerates of independent neuronal contributions. Meanwhile, a growing number of studies suggest that many cognitive functions are sustained by serial patterns of activity. Here, we investigate stashes of such patterns using path homology theory—an impartial, universal approach that does not require a priori assumptions about the sequences’ nature, functionality, underlying mechanisms, or other contexts. We focus on the hippocampus—a key enabler of learning and memory in mammalian brains—and quantify the ordinal arrangement of its activity similarly to how its topology has previously been studied in terms of simplicial homologies. The results reveal that the vast majority of sequences produced during spatial navigation are structurally equivalent to one another. Only a few classes of distinct sequences form an ordinal schema of serial activity that remains stable as the pool of sequences consolidates. Importantly, the structure of both maps is upheld by combinations of short sequences, suggesting that brief activity motifs dominate physiological computations. This ordinal organization emerges and stabilizes on timescales characteristic of spatial learning, displaying similar dynamics. Yet, the ordinal maps generally do not reflect topological affinities—spatial and sequential analyses address qualitatively different aspects of spike flows, representing two complementary formats of information processing. Significance statement This study employs path homology theory to examine serial patterns of neuronal activity in the hippocampus, a critical region for learning and memory. While the traditional, simplicial homology approaches used to model cognitive maps, path homology provides a universal framework for analyzing the ordinal arrangement of neuronal sequences without presupposing their nature or function. The findings reveal that a limited number of distinct sequence classes, supported by combinations of short activity motifs, form a stable ordinal schema over timescales corresponding to periods of spatial learning. Notably, the ordinal maps derived from these sequences do not capture topological affinities, highlighting that spatial and sequential analyses address distinct but complementary dimensions of neural information processing.',\n",

On the other hand, the discovery of adult neurogenesis, the process by which new neurons are generated in the adult brain, challenged the traditional view that the brain is a static structure after development. The recent findings showing that adult neurogenesis has a significant role in brain plasticity, learning and memory, and emotional behavior, together with the fact that it is strongly dependent on several external and internal factors, have sparked more interest in this area. The mechanisms of adult neural stem cell (NSC) regulation, the physiological role of NSC-mediated neuroplasticity throughout life, and the most recent NSC-based therapeutic applications will be concisely reviewed. Noteworthy, due to their multipotency, self-renewal potential, and ability to secrete growth and immunomodulatory factors, NSCs have been mainly suggested for (1) transplantation, (2) neurotoxicology tests, and (3) drug screening approaches. The clinical trials of NSC-based therapy for different neurologic conditions are, nonetheless, mostly in the early phases and have not yet demonstrated conclusive efficacy or safety. Here, we provide an outlook of the major challenges and limitations, as well as some promising directions that could help to move toward stem cell widespread use in the treatment and prevention of several neurological disorders.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Methamphetamine (Meth) is one of the most widely used illicit drugs worldwide, exerting potent psychostimulant effects that fuels its highly addictive nature. Chronic Meth use is associated with severe cognitive impairments, particularly in executive functions, decision-making, and working memory, which persist long even after cessation of Meth use. These cognitive deficits are associated with dysfunction of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which regulates addiction and cognition. Both human and animal studies highlight Meth-induced mPFC dysfunction that contributes to compulsive behaviors and relapse. Emerging evidence also highlights significant sex differences in Meth use disorder (MUD). Previous studies suggest that Meth-induced behavioral and neuronal dysfunctions are different between males and females, but the cellular and molecular mechanism are not fully understood. Using behavioral and electrophysiological approaches (whole-cell patching), this study determined certain sex differences in neuronal dysfunction in the mPFC of rats that self-administered Meth (Meth-SA) followed by a short (2–5 d) or long-term (≥30 d) withdrawal. We found that both male and female rats self-administered methamphetamine in a similar pattern; however, the resulting hypoactivity, hyperactivity, and calcium dysregulation in mPFC neurons differed between the sexes. Such sex-specific neuronal dysfunction was associated with, and depended on, short or long-term withdrawal, respectively. By understanding these sex-specific behavioral/neuronal differences following different Meth withdrawal period, our novel findings demonstrate the role of sex as a biological variable in Meth-use and relapse, and reveal the effects of drug-using environment on mPFC neuronal dysfunction during withdrawal, providing insights for gender-specific treatment strategies.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The seamless coordination of hands and mouth—whether in humans eating corn on the cob or mice extracting sunflower seeds—represents one of evolution’s most sophisticated motor achievements. Whereas spinal and brainstem circuits implement basic forelimb and orofacial actions, whether there is a specialized cortical circuit that assembles these actions to enable skilled oromanual manipulation remains unclear. Here, we discover a cortical area and its cell-type-specific circuitry that govern oromanual food manipulation in mice. An optogenetic screen of cortical areas and projection neuron types identified a rostral forelimb-orofacial area (RFO), wherein activation of pyramidal tract (PTFezf2) and intratelencephalic (ITPlxnD1) neurons induced concerted posture, forelimb and orofacial movements resembling eating. In a freely moving pasta-eating behavior, pharmacological RFO inactivation impaired the sitting posture, hand recruitment, and oromanual coordination in pasta eating. RFO PTFezf2 and ITPlxnD1 activity was closely correlated with oromanual pasta manipulation and hand-assisted biting. Optogenetic inhibition revealed that PTsFezf2 regulate dexterous hand and mouth movements while ITsPlxnD1 play a more prominent role in oromanual coordination. RFO forms the hub of an extensive network, with reciprocal connections to cortical forelimb and orofacial sensorimotor areas, as well as insular and visceral areas. Within this cortical network, RFO PTsFezf2 project unilaterally to multiple subcortical, brainstem and spinal areas associated with forelimb and orofacial control, while ITsPlxnD1 project bilaterally to the entire network and the ventrolateral striatum, and can mediate concurrent forelimb and mouth movement in part through their striatal projection. Together, these findings uncover the cell-type-specific implementation of a cortical circuit that orchestrates oromanual manipulation, essential for skilled feeding.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The role of chromatin biology and epigenetics in disease progression is gaining increasing recognition. Genes that escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI) can impact neuroinflammation through epigenetic mechanisms. Our previous study has suggested that the X escapee genes Kdm6a and Kdm5c are involved in microglial activation after stroke in aged mice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that Kdm6a/5c demethylate H3K27Me3/H3K4Me3 in microglia, respectively, and mediate the transcription of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and IRF4, leading to microglial pro-inflammatory responses and exacerbated stroke injury. Aged (17-20\\xa0months) Kdm6a/5c microglial conditional knockout (CKO) female mice (one allele of the gene) were subjected to a 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Gene floxed females (two alleles) and males (one allele) were included as controls. Infarct volume and behavioral deficits were quantified 3\\xa0days after stroke. Immune responses including microglial activation and infiltration of peripheral leukocytes in the ischemic brain were assessed by flow cytometry. Epigenetic modification of IRF5/4 by Kdm6a/5c was analyzed by CUT&RUN assay. The demethylation of H3K27Me3 by kdm6a increased IRF5 transcription; meanwhile, Kdm5c demethylated H3K4Me3 to repress IRF5. Both Kdm6afl/fl and Kdm5cfl/fl mice had worse stroke outcomes compared to fl/y and CKO mice. Gene floxed females showed more robust expression of CD68 in microglia and elevated brain and plasma levels of IL-1β or TNF-α, after stroke. We concluded that IRF5 signaling plays a critical role in mediating the deleterious effect of Kdm6a, whereas Kdm5c's effect is independent of IRF5.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Suspense is an affective state ubiquitous in human life, from art to quotidian events. However, little is known about the behavior of large-scale brain networks during suspenseful experiences. To address this question, we examined the continuous brain responses of participants watching a suspenseful movie, along with reported levels of suspense from an independent set of viewers. We employ sliding window analysis and Pearson correlation to measure functional connectivity states over time. Then, we use Mapper, a topological data analysis tool, to obtain a graphical representation that captures the dynamical transitions of the brain across states; this representation enables the anchoring of the topological characteristics of the combinatorial object with the measured suspense. Our analysis revealed changes in functional connectivity within and between the salience, fronto-parietal, and default networks associated with suspense. In particular, the functional connectivity between the salience and fronto-parietal networks increased with the level of suspense. In contrast, the connections of both networks with the default network decreased. Together, our findings reveal specific dynamical changes in functional connectivity at the network level associated with variation in suspense, and suggest topological data analysis as a potentially powerful tool for studying dynamic brain networks.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'It has been well documented that cold is an enhancer of lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues, yet its effect on central nervous system lipid dynamics is underexplored. It is well recognized that cold acclimations enhance adipocyte functions, including white adipose tissue lipid lipolysis and beiging, and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in mammals. However, it remains unclear whether and how lipid metabolism in the brain is also under the control of ambient temperature. Here, we show that cold exposure predominantly increases the expressions of the lipid lipolysis genes and proteins within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) in male mice. Mechanistically, by using innovatively combined brain-region selective pharmacology and in vivo time-lapse photometry monitoring of lipid metabolism, we find that cold activates cells within the PVH and pharmacological inactivation of cells blunts cold-induced effects on lipid peroxidation, accumulation of lipid droplets, and lipid lipolysis in the PVH. Together, these findings suggest that PVH lipid metabolism is cold sensitive and integral to cold-induced broader regulatory responses.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Predicting the biological behavior and time to recurrence (TTR) of high-grade diffuse gliomas (HGG) after maximum safe neurosurgical resection and combined radiation and chemotherapy plays a pivotal role in planning clinical follow-up, selecting potentially necessary second-line treatment and improving the quality of life for patients diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. The current standard-of-care (SoC) for HGG includes follow-up neuroradiological imaging to detect recurrence as early as possible and relies on several clinical, neuropathological, and radiological prognostic factors, which have limited accuracy in predicting TTR. In this study, using an in-silico analysis, we aim to improve predictive power for TTR by considering the role of (i) prognostically relevant information available through diagnostics used in the current SoC, (ii) advanced image-based information not currently part of the standard diagnostic workup, such as tumor-normal tissue interface (edge) features and quantitative data specific to biopsy positions within the tumor, and (iii) information on tumor-associated macrophages. In particular, we introduced a state-of-the-art spatio-temporal model of tumor-immune interactions, emphasizing the interplay between macrophages and glioma cells. This model serves as a synthetic reality for assessing the predictive value of various features. We generated a cohort of virtual patients based on our mathematical model. Each patient’s dataset includes simulated T1Gd and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI volumes. T1-weighted imaging highlights anatomical structures with high contrast, providing clear detail on brain morphology, whereas FLAIR suppresses fluid signals, improving the visualization of lesions near fluid-filled spaces, which is particularly helpful for identifying peritumoral edema. Additionally, we simulated results on macrophage density and proliferative activity, either in a specified part of the tumor, namely the tumor core or edge (“localized”), or unspecified (“non-localized”). To enhance the realism of our synthetic data, we imposed different levels of noise. Our findings reveal that macrophage density at the tumor edge contributed to a high predictive value of feature importance for the selected regression model. Moreover, there are lower MSE values for the “localized” biopsy in prediction accuracy toward recurrence post-resection compared with “non-localized” specimens in the noisy data. In conclusion, the results show that localized biopsies provided more information about tumor behavior, especially at the interface of tumor and normal tissue (Edge).',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems. Among the most severe manifestations of SLE is lupus nephritis (LN), which causes particularly high morbidity. Recently, we identified amphiregulin (AREG), an epidermal growth factor receptor ligand, as a key mediator of LN via downregulation of pathogenic CD4+ T-cell responses. In human LN, AREG is mainly produced by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and monocytes/macrophages (M/M). Since AREG´s functions have been shown to vary considerably depending on the source, we aimed to clarify the cell-type-specific roles of AREG using the pristane model of LN. Conditional knockout mice lacking Treg- but not M/M-derived AREG showed worse LN outcome at 12 and 15 months with increased glomerular cell proliferation, apoptosis and renal tissue fibrosis. Interestingly, immune responses were not relevantly affected by the lack of AREG from either leukocyte source, indicating a different mechanism. In this respect, in vitro studies demonstrated improved wound healing of murine mesangium and tubulus cells and enhanced regeneration and sprouting of human glomerular endothelial cells after incubation with recombinant AREG. These findings underscore the importance of Treg-derived AREG in tissue regeneration and protection from fibrosis in LN, highlighting AREG as a potential therapeutic target.

       "    'abstract': 'The entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) is often termed as one of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia owing to their highly convergent anatomy. The rodent EPN has been implicated in reward and value coding whereas the primate analog internal Globus Pallidus has been found to be modulated by some movements and in some circumstances. In this study, we sought to understand how the rodent EPN might be coding kinematic, reward, and difficulty parameters, particularly during locomotion. Furthermore, we aimed to understand the level of movement representation: whole-body or specific body parts. To this end, mice were trained in a freely moving two-alternative forced choice task with two periods of displacement (return and go trajectories) and performed electrophysiological recordings together with video-based tracking. We found (1) robust reward coding but not difficulty. (2) Spatio-temporal variables better explain EPN activity during movement compared to kinematic variables, while both types of variables were more robustly represented in reward-related movement. (3) Reward-sensitive units encode kinematics similarly to reward-insensitive ones. (4) Population dynamics that best account for differences between these two periods of movement can be explained by allocentric references like distance to reward port. (5) The representation of paw and licks is not mutually exclusive, discarding a somatotopic muscle-level representation of movement in the EPN. Our data suggest that EPN activity represents movements and reward in a complex way: highly multiplexed, influenced by the objective of the displacement, where trajectories that lead to reward better represent spatial and kinematic variables. Interestingly, there are intertwining representations of whole-body movement kinematics with a single paw and licking variables. Further, reward-sensitive units encode kinematics similarly to reward-insensitive ones, challenging the notion of distinct pathways for reward and movement processing.',\n",

Here, we developed highly sensitive sensors to monitor Rab protein activity in single dendritic spines undergoing structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) in rodent organotypic hippocampal slices. During sLTP, Rab10 was persistently inactivated (>30 min) in the stimulated spines, whereas Rab4 was transiently activated over ∼5 min. Inhibiting or deleting Rab10 enhanced sLTP, electrophysiological LTP and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking during sLTP. In contrast, disrupting Rab4 impaired sLTP only in the first few minutes, and decreased AMPAR trafficking during sLTP. Thus, our results suggest that Rab10 and Rab4 oppositely regulate AMPAR trafficking during sLTP, and inactivation of Rab10 signaling facilitates the induction of LTP and associated spine structural plasticity.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Attentional capture by an irrelevant salient distractor is attenuated when the distractor appears more frequently in one location, suggesting learned suppression of that location. However, it remains unclear whether suppression is proactive (before attention is directed) or reactive (after attention is allocated). Here, we investigated this using a ‘pinging’ technique to probe the attentional distribution before search onset. In an EEG experiment, participants searched for a shape singleton while ignoring a color singleton distractor at a high-probability location. To reveal the hidden attentional priority map, participants also performed a continuous recall spatial memory task, with a neutral placeholder display presented before search onset. Behaviorally, search was more efficient when the distractor appeared at the high-probability location. Inverted encoding analysis of EEG data showed tuning profiles that decayed during memory maintenance but were revived by the placeholder display. Notably, tuning was most pronounced at the to-be-suppressed location, suggesting initial spatial selection followed by suppression. These findings suggest that learned distractor suppression is a reactive process, providing new insights into learned spatial distractor suppression mechanisms.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Microglia mediate the immune response in the central nervous system to many insults, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin that initiates neuroinflammation in the neonatal population, especially preterm infants. The synthesis of the proinflammatory proteins CD40 and NLRP3 depends on the canonical NF-κB cascade as the genes encoding CD40 and NLRP3 are transcribed by the phosphorylated NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer in LPS-induced microglia. Exosomes, which are nanosized vesicles (40–150 nm) involved in intercellular communication, are implicated in many pathophysiological processes. Human breast milk, which is rich in exosomes, plays a vital role in neonatal immune system maturation and adaptation. Activated microglia may cause brain-associated injuries or disorders; therefore, we hypothesize that human breast milk-derived exosomes (HBME) attenuate LPS-induced activation of CD40 and NLRP3 by decreasing p38 MAPK and NF-κB p50/p65 activation/phosphorylation downstream of TLR4 in murine microglia (BV2). Human microglia (HMC3) showed a significant decrease in p65 phosphorylation. We isolated purified HBME and characterized them using nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and western blots. Analysis of microglia exposed to LPS and HBME indicated that HBME modulated the expression of signaling molecules in the canonical NF-κB pathway, including MyD88, IκBα, p38 MAPK, NF-κB p65, and their products CD40, NLRP3, and cytokines IL-1β and IL-10. Thus, HBMEs have great potential for attenuating the microglial response to LPS.

We highlight how computational frameworks such as reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks capture key features of adolescent behavior, including shifts in exploration and decision-making strategies. By integrating principles of brain development, such as synaptic pruning and the hierarchical development of neural circuits, computational models can offer insights into how the brain adapts to new experiences and challenges.

Using confocal, superresolution, and two-photon microscopy as well as whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, we confirm that the subcellular scaffold of the AIS and electrophysiological parameters of labeled cells remain unchanged. We further uncover rapid AIS remodeling following increased network activity in this model system, as well as highly reproducible in vivo labeling of AIS over weeks.

       "    'abstract': 'Neurovascular coupling, linking neuronal activity to cerebral blood flow, is essential for brain function and underpins functional brain imaging. Whereas mechanisms involved in vasodilation are well-documented, those controlling vasoconstriction remain overlooked. This study unravels the mechanisms by which pyramidal cells elicit arteriole vasoconstriction. Using patch-clamp recording, vascular and Ca2+ imaging in mouse cortical slices, we show that strong optogenetic activation of layer II/III pyramidal cells induces vasoconstriction, correlating with firing frequency and somatic Ca2+ increase. Ex vivo and in vivo pharmacological investigations indicate that this vasoconstriction predominantly recruits prostaglandin E2 through the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway, and activation of EP1 and EP3 receptors. We also present evidence that specific interneurons releasing neuropeptide Y, and astrocytes, through 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, contribute to this process. By revealing the mechanisms by which pyramidal cells lead to vasoconstriction, our findings shed light on the complex regulation of neurovascular coupling. Significance statement Cerebral blood flow is tightly controlled by neuronal activity, a process termed neurovascular coupling which serves as the physiological basis for functional brain imaging widely used to map neuronal activity in health and diseases. While the prevailing view links increased neuronal activity with enhanced blood perfusion, our data suggest that elevated neuronal activity can also reduce cerebral blood flow. By optically controlling the activity of pyramidal cells, we demonstrate that these excitatory neurons induce vasoconstriction when their action potential firing is increased by releasing glutamate and lipid messengers. These findings update the interpretation of functional brain imaging signals and help to better understand the etiopathogenesis of epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, in which hyperactivity, hypoperfusion and cognitive deficits overlap.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Weightlessness usually causes disruption of the gut microbiota and impairs cognitive function. There is a close connection between gut microbiota and neurological diseases. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has a beneficial effect on reducing intestinal inflammation. So we wondered if abdominal LIPUS stimulation can have a positive impact on weightlessness induced cognitive decline by reducing intestinal dysfunction. The findings revealed that the hind limb unloaded mice exhibited evident disruption in intestinal structure and gut microbial homeostasis, along with impairment in their learning and memory capabilities. However, 4-week abdominal LIPUS treatment improved intestinal function in hind limb unloaded mice, characterized by upregulation of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin expression in the colon, increased diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota, decreased serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and increased short chain fatty acids in colon contents. The hind limb unloaded mice treated with LIPUS exhibited heightened activity levels, improved exploratory tendencies, and significantly enhanced learning and memory faculties, and elevated expression of neuroadaptation-related proteins such as PSD95, GAP43, P-CREB, BDNF, and its receptor TRKB in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the hind limb unloaded mice receiving fecal transplants from the mice whose abdomens were irradiated with LIPUS displayed enhanced cognitive abilities and improved intestinal structure, akin to the outcomes observed in hind limb unloaded mice who received LIPUS abdominal treatment directly. The above results indicate that LIPUS enhances intestinal structure and microbiota, which helps alleviate cognitive impairment caused by weightlessness. LIPUS could be a potential strategy to simultaneously improve gut dysfunction and cognitive decline in astronauts or bedridden patients.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Accurate tomato ripeness detection is essential for optimizing harvest timing and maximizing yield. Deep learning-based object detection has proven effective in this task. However, many existing algorithms have numerous parameters and substantial computational demands, making them unsuitable for agricultural environments with limited computational resources. Additionally, accurate detection becomes challenging with overlapping fruits, leaf occlusion, or complex backgrounds. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight detection model, GSBF-YOLO. This model designs the GSim module to reduce parameters while maintaining detection accuracy. The C3Ghost module further reduces parameter count by replacing the traditional C3 module. The PANet multi-scale feature fusion network in the neck is replaced with the Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN), which adjusts weights based on the importance of input features. Lastly, the ﬁne-tuned FocalEIOU Loss function is used to calculate the bounding box regression loss, enhancing the model’s ability to adjust the weights of high-quality anchor boxes for better detection of targets in occlusion scenarios. Experimental results show that GSBF-YOLO reduces parameters and computational load by 42% and 45%, respectively, while mean Average Precision (mAP) increases by 1.9% and 1.6% on two datasets. The model achieves 110 Frames Per Second (FPS), meeting real-time detection requirements, and has fewer parameters and higher accuracy compared to models like YOLOv8. The research indicates that the proposed lightweight model can effectively detect tomato ripeness in natural environments.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Systemic blood coagulation accompanies inflammation during severe infections like sepsis and COVID. We previously established a link between coagulopathy and pyroptosis, a vital defense mechanism against infection. During pyroptosis, the formation of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores on the plasma membrane leads to the release of tissue factor (TF)-positive microvesicles (MVs) that are procoagulant. Mice lacking GSDMD release fewer of these procoagulant MVs. However, the specific mechanisms coupling the activation of GSDMD to MV release remain unclear. Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in pyroptosis was recently reported to be actively mediated by the transmembrane protein Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1). Here, we show that NINJ1 promotes procoagulant MV release during pyroptosis. Haploinsufficiency or glycine inhibition of NINJ1 limited the release of procoagulant MVs and inflammatory cytokines, and partially protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin. Our findings suggest a crucial role for NINJ1-dependent PMR in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Introduction Cerebral ischemic strokes cause brain damage, primarily through inflammatory factors. One of the regions most affected by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is the hippocampus, specifically the CA1 area, which is highly susceptible to ischemia. Previous studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of quercetin. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of quercetin on hippocampal CA1 neurons following MCAO. Materials and methods Fifty-six male Albino Wistar rats were divided into seven groups (intact, sham, stroke, vehicle, and three quercetin-treated groups receiving 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, respectively), each containing 8 rats. Various assessments, including brain water content, the rotarod test, the Bederson neurological score, the Morris water maze (MWM) test, the shuttle box test, histopathological evaluations, and measurements of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, were conducted across the groups. Results Compared with control rats, 5 and 10 mg/kg quercetin-treated rats presented significant improvements in brain water content, neurological function, and motor function and improved performance in the MWM and shuttle box tests. Histopathological analyses revealed better preservation of CA1 neurons in these groups. Additionally, IL-10 levels significantly increased, whereas IL-1β levels significantly decreased. However, the group receiving 20 mg/kg quercetin showed no statistically significant changes in the parameters assessed (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Conclusion Quercetin may help prevent or ameliorate brain injuries caused by acute stroke, suggesting its neuroprotective effects. The reduction in IL-1β and increase in IL-10 may play key roles in quercetin’s protective mechanism.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Diabetic neuropathic pain is associated with elevated plasma levels of methylglyoxal (MGO). MGO is a metabolite of glycolysis that causes pain hypersensitivity in mice by stimulating the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α) and subsequently activating the integrated stress response (ISR). We first established that Zucker diabetic fatty rats have enhanced MGO signaling, engage ISR, and develop pain hypersensitivity. Since nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that neutralize MGO, we hypothesized that fumarates, like diroximel fumarate (DRF), will stimulate Nrf2 signaling, and prevent MGO-induced ISR and pain hypersensitivity. DRF (100 mg/kg) treated animals were protected from developing MGO (20 ng) induced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. Mechanistically, DRF treatment protected against MGO-induced increase in p-eIF2α levels in the sciatic nerve and reduced loss of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. Using Nrf2 knockout mice, we demonstrate that Nrf2 is necessary for the antinociceptive effects of DRF. Cotreatment of MGO (1 µmol/L) with monomethyl fumarate (10, 20, and 50 µmol/L), the active metabolite of DRF, prevented ISR in both mouse and human dorsal root ganglia neurons. Our data show that targeting Nrf2 with DRF is a strategy to potentially alleviate pain associated with elevated MGO levels. Article Highlights Methylglyoxal (MGO) induces mechanical and cold hypersensitivity in mice that is prevented with daily treatment with diroximel fumarate (DRF). DRF protects against MGO-induced integrated stress response activation in the sciatic nerve and loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers. DRF treatment does not protect Nrf2 knockout mice from developing pain hypersensitivity, suggesting that Nrf2 is necessary for DRF’s antinociceptive effects. Monomethyl fumarate, the active metabolite of DRF, prevents MGO-induced increase in p-eIF2α levels in mouse and human dorsal root ganglia neurons in vitro. Nrf2 activators, like the Food and Drug Administration–approved DRF, could be evaluated in clinical trials for diabetic neuropathic pain.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive multisystem disease characterized by limb and trunk muscle weakness that is attributed, in part, to abnormalities in mitochondrial ultrastructure and impaired mitochondrial functions. This study investigated the time course of structural and functional rearrangements in skeletal muscle mitochondria in combination with motor impairments in Tg (copper-zinc superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD1) G93A) dl1/GurJ (referred to as SOD1-G93A/low) male mice, a familial ALS model, as compared with non-transgenic littermates.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nThe neurological status and motor functions were assessed weekly using the paw grip endurance method and the grid suspension test with two-limb and four-limb suspension tasks. Transmission electron microscopy followed by quantitative analysis was performed to study ultrastructural alterations in the quadriceps femoris. Functional analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondria was performed using high-resolution Oxygraph-2k (O2K) respirometry and methods for assessing the calcium retention capacity index and the content of lipid peroxidation products in freshly isolated preparations.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nBased on the behavioral phenotyping data, specific age groups were identified: postnatal day 56 (P56) (n = 10-11), 84 (P84) (n = 10-11), and 156 (P154) (n = 10-12), representing the pre-symptomatic, early-symptomatic and late-symptomatic stages of ALS progression in SOD1-G93A/low mice, respectively. Electron microscopy showed mosaic destructive changes in subsarcolemmal mitochondria in fibers of the quadriceps femoris from 84-day-old SOD1-G93A/low mice. Morphometric analysis revealed an elevation in the mean size of the mitochondria in SOD1-G93A mice at P84 and P154. In addition, the P154 transgenic group demonstrated a decrease in sarcomere width and the number of mitochondria per unit area. At the symptomatic stage, SOD1-G93A mice exhibited a decreased respiratory control ratio, ADP-stimulated, and uncoupled respiration rates of mitochondria isolated from the quadriceps femoris muscle, as measured by high-resolution respirometry. In parallel, the mitochondria showed lower calcium retention capacity and increased levels of lipid peroxidation products compared with the control.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nTaken together, these results indicate stage-dependent changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial ultrastructure and functions associated with defective oxidative phosphorylation, impaired calcium homeostasis, and oxidative damage in the SOD1-G93A/low mouse model, which appears to be a promising direction for the development of combination therapies for ALS.',\n",

However, their contribution to perceptual consciousness is still unclear, due to the inherent difficulties of recording subcortical neuronal activity in humans. Here, we asked neurological patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation to detect weak vibrotactile stimuli applied on their hand while recording single neuron activity from the tip of a microelectrode. We isolated putative single neurons in the subthalamic nucleus and thalamus. A significant proportion of neurons modulated their activity while participants were expecting a stimulus. We found that the firing rate of 23% of these neurons differed between detected and undetected stimuli. Our results provide direct neurophysiological evidence of the involvement of the subthalamic nucleus and the thalamus for the detection of vibrotactile stimuli, thereby calling for a less cortico-centric view of the neural correlates of consciousness.',\n",

Molecular and cellular processes that mediate this phenomenon are intricate and include neuronal and glial functions, signaling pathways, and synaptic reorganization. Objective: This work will address the molecular and cellular aspects of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and its role in the formation of episodic memories through processes including dendritic spine remodelling, astrocytes and microglia, and epigenetics. Methodology: Literature review of recent findings and theoretical frameworks such as Morris’s neurobiological theory of the hippocampus was done to synthesize the molecular markers, signaling pathways, and neuromodulation. Experimental data regarding the involvement of calcium signaling, synaptic tagging, and protein synthesis dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in memory formation were reviewed. Results: This paper discusses how calcium influx, CaMKII activation and CREB-mediated transcription contribute to the preservation of LTP. Dendritic spine remodeling is highlighted as a key structural process and astrocytes and microglia are identified to regulate synaptic plasticity and neural circuit function. Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation, relate synaptic activity to the expression of genes associated with memory.

These state changes affect both internal computation and the organism’s responses to sensory inputs. Understanding neuronal mechanisms supporting exploratory and consummatory states and their switching requires experimental control of behavioral shifts and collecting sufficient amounts of brain data. To achieve this goal, we developed the ThermoMaze, which exploits the animal’s natural warmth-seeking homeostatic behavior. By decreasing the floor temperature and selectively heating unmarked areas, we observed that mice avoided the aversive state by exploring the maze and finding the warm spot. In its design, the ThermoMaze is analogous to the widely used water maze but without the inconvenience of a wet environment and, therefore, allows the collection of physiological data in many trials. We combined the ThermoMaze with electrophysiology recording, and report that spiking activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons during sharp-wave ripple events encode the position of mice. Thus, place-specific firing is not confined to locomotion and associated theta oscillations but persist during waking immobility and sleep at the same location. The ThermoMaze will allow for detailed studies of brain correlates of immobility, preparatory–consummatory transitions, and open new options for studying behavior-mediated temperature homeostasis.', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://github.com/elifesciences/enhanced-preprints-data/raw/master/data/90347/v1/90347-v1.pdf', 'authorName': 'M.

Cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to stress, plays a pivotal role in modulating this response. Its primary function is to mobilize energy, regulate inflammation, and enhance cognitive processes during acute stress. While cortisol facilitates adaptation by suppressing overactive immune responses and ensuring resource availability, its prolonged elevation can lead to detrimental effects, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive impairments. Conversely, inadequate cortisol production disrupts the bodyâ€™s ability to manage stress, resulting in conditions like fatigue, hypotension, and impaired recovery. This study explores the dynamic relationship between stress and cortisol, emphasizing how balanced cortisol levels contribute to stress resolution and homeostasis restoration. Understanding cortisolâ€™s dual role provides insights into its potential therapeutic applications for managing stress-related disorders.\", 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://talenta.usu.ac.id/ijoep/article/download/19118/8494', 'authorName': 'Anliana,Henry Panguhutan Sitorus,Melva Silitonga', 'venue': 'International Journal of Ecophysiology', 'main_text': [], 'title': 'The Role of cortisol in the stress response', 'publicationDate': '2025-03-18', 'fieldsOfStudy': '', 'score_qdrant': 0.8106657}, {'paperIdQ': '23ecbe18-bf4c-5be1-8d78-524ca17e91b3', 'paperId': '55f31d6ca92e0defba5a4cbcc77795659baa4c04', 'citationCount': 0, 'abstract': 'The oral-gut-brain (OGB) axis is a three-way communication process that forms cognitive functions, especially learning and memory (LM) formation. Recent studies showed that the OGB axis is pivotal in efficiently forming and regulating the brain homeostasis mechanism. In this OGB axis, oral and gut commensals play a major role in the bidirectional communication with the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The dysbiosis of oral and gut commensals results in cognitive dysfunctions like cognitive decline. The present study aimed to study the effect of Escherichia coli induced oral-gut dysbiosis on cognitive memory (CM) formation with the help of a cue-based learning paradigm (CBLP). Other than CM formation, stress memory (SM) formation was also studied with the help of behavioural paradigms like predator exposure test (PET), light and dark box test (LDBT), and open field test (OFT) in naïve goldfish Carassius auratus. The results of the study proved that the OGB axis is possibly involved in the formation of CM by inhibiting stress formation in a habituated, serene environment. Behavioural responses of E. coli-infused groups showed that higher colonization/accumulation of E. coli results in the formation of cognitive decline through the release of shiga toxin (ST) metabolites. It also showed that the release of ST metabolites may disrupt gut dysbiosis through the development of gastroenteritis. Developed gastroenteritis further results in cognitive memory - decline (70-75 %) due to the long-term existence of E. coli-induced oral/gut dysbiosis.

Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal strategies during such decisions1–5. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioural strategies such as persevering, exploring or disengaging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub that is critical for flexible switching between behavioural strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations, fibre photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behaviours, we found that the main cell types of the MRN—GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic (VGluT2+) and serotonergic neurons—have complementary functions and regulate perseverance, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons—for instance, through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus, which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN—leads to perseverative behaviour. By contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2+ neurons drives exploration. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula that conveys negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioural switchboard that is uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioural strategies. These circuits thus may also have an important role in the aetiology of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08672-1.pdf', 'authorName': 'Mehran Ahmadlou,Maryam Yasamin Shirazi,Pan Zhang,Isaac L M Rogers,Julia Dziubek,Margaret Young,Sonja B.

The recent findings showing that adult neurogenesis has a significant role in brain plasticity, learning and memory, and emotional behavior, together with the fact that it is strongly dependent on several external and internal factors, have sparked more interest in this area. The mechanisms of adult neural stem cell (NSC) regulation, the physiological role of NSC-mediated neuroplasticity throughout life, and the most recent NSC-based therapeutic applications will be concisely reviewed. Noteworthy, due to their multipotency, self-renewal potential, and ability to secrete growth and immunomodulatory factors, NSCs have been mainly suggested for (1) transplantation, (2) neurotoxicology tests, and (3) drug screening approaches. The clinical trials of NSC-based therapy for different neurologic conditions are, nonetheless, mostly in the early phases and have not yet demonstrated conclusive efficacy or safety.

Sleep genes are enriched for synaptic shaping cellular components controlling glutamate synapse phenotype, overlap with autism risk genes, and are primarily observed in excitatory pyramidal neurons projecting intra-telencephalically.

Given the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of inflammation-related delirium, we investigated the temporal dynamics of neurobehavioral changes and microglial responses, following lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 200 μg/kg) administration in young and old male C57BL/6 mice. Although a similar illness trajectory across 48 h post-treatment (HPT) was observed in both age groups, old-LPS mice exhibited worsened delirium-like behavior. At 48 HPT, in old but not young mice, significantly decreased hippocampal neuronal activity coincided with microglial overactivation. Widespread hippocampal microglial activation was present at 3 HPT but subsided by 12 HPT in young but not old mice, indicating a generally retarded but prolonged microglial response to LPS challenge in old mice. However, for both age groups, at 3 HPT, p16INK4a-negative microglia (with low abundance in the aged brain) exhibited comparable morphological activation, which was not observed for p16INK4a-positive microglia (highly abundant in the aged brain). These results suggest that age-related susceptibility to LPS-induced delirium-like behavior accompanied by different patterns of microglial response might implicate microglial composition shifts and that optimizing microglial composition represents a promising approach to reduce vulnerability to inflammatory challenge.', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/5/2055/pdf?version=1740641495', 'authorName': 'Congli Sun,Xiaomin Kang,Xirui Jia,Yuwei Wang,Lijia Zhao,Xinyu Sun,Anaerguli Abula,Lijie Liu', 'venue': 'International Journal of Molecular Sciences', 'main_text': [], 'title': 'Age-Related Differences in Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Delirium-like Behavior Implicate the Distinct Microglial Composition in the Hippocampus', 'publicationDate': '2025-02-26', 'fieldsOfStudy': 'Medicine', 'score_qdrant': 0.8029684}, {'paperIdQ': 'f730ae05-19e0-5ecc-99c6-e15b75aa92b5', 'paperId': 'b6dc6d42c9660ed6da98f54a6c98cbcc4b6e3f8c', 'citationCount': 0, 'abstract': 'None', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://hal.science/hal-04688461/file/Neri_2024.pdf', 'authorName': 'Matteo Neri,A.

Microglia are key immune cells in the central nervous system and have important regulatory functions in the control of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Microglia have both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, but the mechanism by which they protect or damage the nerve remains unclear. Here, I used an in vitro cell culture approach to investigate the role of microglia in neuroinflammation and its regulation of amyloid- peptides. The same methods were used to investigate the effect of cytokines on microglial polarization and the clearance of amyloid-. Expected conclusion: Cytokines such as IL-4 and TGF- can promote the polarization of microglia to M2 direction and enhance its anti-inflammatory effect. Pro-inflammatory factors can induce its polarization to M1 direction and aggravate the degree of neuroinflammation. Therefore, microglia can not only clear amyloid beta, but also damage the nerve and accelerate the process of Alzheimer's disease. By studying this mechanism, I will find ways to promote the large-scale conversion of microglia to M2, which will provide new directions for Alzheimer's disease research and help develop new treatments.\", 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.ewadirect.com/proceedings/tns/article/view/19870/pdf', 'authorName': 'Jiahui Chen', 'venue': 'Theoretical and Natural Science', 'main_text': [], 'title': \"Dual role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease and polarizing effect of cytokines\", 'publicationDate': '2025-01-09', 'fieldsOfStudy': '', 'score_qdrant': 0.7993126}, {'paperIdQ': '2fb39005-32ec-5895-9bf4-cd44473566c1', 'paperId': 'c5a556255d8efe2bfdccd66fb06654a1e9ea8e27', 'citationCount': 0, 'abstract': 'Methamphetamine (Meth) is one of the most widely used illicit drugs worldwide, exerting potent psychostimulant effects that fuels its highly addictive nature. Chronic Meth use is associated with severe cognitive impairments, particularly in executive functions, decision-making, and working memory, which persist long even after cessation of Meth use. These cognitive deficits are associated with dysfunction of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which regulates addiction and cognition. Both human and animal studies highlight Meth-induced mPFC dysfunction that contributes to compulsive behaviors and relapse. Emerging evidence also highlights significant sex differences in Meth use disorder (MUD). Previous studies suggest that Meth-induced behavioral and neuronal dysfunctions are different between males and females, but the cellular and molecular mechanism are not fully understood. Using behavioral and electrophysiological approaches (whole-cell patching), this study determined certain sex differences in neuronal dysfunction in the mPFC of rats that self-administered Meth (Meth-SA) followed by a short (2–5 d) or long-term (≥30 d) withdrawal. We found that both male and female rats self-administered methamphetamine in a similar pattern; however, the resulting hypoactivity, hyperactivity, and calcium dysregulation in mPFC neurons differed between the sexes. Such sex-specific neuronal dysfunction was associated with, and depended on, short or long-term withdrawal, respectively. By understanding these sex-specific behavioral/neuronal differences following different Meth withdrawal period, our novel findings demonstrate the role of sex as a biological variable in Meth-use and relapse, and reveal the effects of drug-using environment on mPFC neuronal dysfunction during withdrawal, providing insights for gender-specific treatment strategies.', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1527795/pdf', 'authorName': 'Lihua Chen,Tabita Kreko-Pierce,Stefanie L.

The current standard-of-care (SoC) for HGG includes follow-up neuroradiological imaging to detect recurrence as early as possible and relies on several clinical, neuropathological, and radiological prognostic factors, which have limited accuracy in predicting TTR. In this study, using an in-silico analysis, we aim to improve predictive power for TTR by considering the role of (i) prognostically relevant information available through diagnostics used in the current SoC, (ii) advanced image-based information not currently part of the standard diagnostic workup, such as tumor-normal tissue interface (edge) features and quantitative data specific to biopsy positions within the tumor, and (iii) information on tumor-associated macrophages. In particular, we introduced a state-of-the-art spatio-temporal model of tumor-immune interactions, emphasizing the interplay between macrophages and glioma cells. This model serves as a synthetic reality for assessing the predictive value of various features. We generated a cohort of virtual patients based on our mathematical model. Each patient’s dataset includes simulated T1Gd and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI volumes. T1-weighted imaging highlights anatomical structures with high contrast, providing clear detail on brain morphology, whereas FLAIR suppresses fluid signals, improving the visualization of lesions near fluid-filled spaces, which is particularly helpful for identifying peritumoral edema. Additionally, we simulated results on macrophage density and proliferative activity, either in a specified part of the tumor, namely the tumor core or edge (“localized”), or unspecified (“non-localized”). To enhance the realism of our synthetic data, we imposed different levels of noise. Our findings reveal that macrophage density at the tumor edge contributed to a high predictive value of feature importance for the selected regression model. Moreover, there are lower MSE values for the “localized” biopsy in prediction accuracy toward recurrence post-resection compared with “non-localized” specimens in the noisy data. In conclusion, the results show that localized biopsies provided more information about tumor behavior, especially at the interface of tumor and normal tissue (Edge).', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-024-00478-7.pdf', 'authorName': 'Pejman Shojaee,Edwin Weinholtz,N.

MGO is a metabolite of glycolysis that causes pain hypersensitivity in mice by stimulating the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α) and subsequently activating the integrated stress response (ISR). We first established that Zucker diabetic fatty rats have enhanced MGO signaling, engage ISR, and develop pain hypersensitivity. Since nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that neutralize MGO, we hypothesized that fumarates, like diroximel fumarate (DRF), will stimulate Nrf2 signaling, and prevent MGO-induced ISR and pain hypersensitivity. DRF (100 mg/kg) treated animals were protected from developing MGO (20 ng) induced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. Mechanistically, DRF treatment protected against MGO-induced increase in p-eIF2α levels in the sciatic nerve and reduced loss of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. Using Nrf2 knockout mice, we demonstrate that Nrf2 is necessary for the antinociceptive effects of DRF. Cotreatment of MGO (1 µmol/L) with monomethyl fumarate (10, 20, and 50 µmol/L), the active metabolite of DRF, prevented ISR in both mouse and human dorsal root ganglia neurons. Our data show that targeting Nrf2 with DRF is a strategy to potentially alleviate pain associated with elevated MGO levels. Article Highlights Methylglyoxal (MGO) induces mechanical and cold hypersensitivity in mice that is prevented with daily treatment with diroximel fumarate (DRF). DRF protects against MGO-induced integrated stress response activation in the sciatic nerve and loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers.

We employ sliding window analysis and Pearson correlation to measure functional connectivity states over time. Then, we use Mapper, a topological data analysis tool, to obtain a graphical representation that captures the dynamical transitions of the brain across states; this representation enables the anchoring of the topological characteristics of the combinatorial object with the measured suspense. Our analysis revealed changes in functional connectivity within and between the salience, fronto-parietal, and default networks associated with suspense. In particular, the functional connectivity between the salience and fronto-parietal networks increased with the level of suspense.

However, the gut tube requires guidance to loop in a reproducible manner. The dorsal mesentery (DM) connects the gut tube to the body and directs the lengthening gut into stereotypical loops via left-right (LR) asymmetric cellular and extracellular behavior. The LR asymmetry of the DM also governs blood and lymphatic vessel formation for the digestive tract, which is essential for prenatal organ development and postnatal vital functions including nutrient absorption. Although the genetic LR asymmetry of the DM has been extensively studied, a divider between the left and right DM has yet to be identified. Setting up LR asymmetry for the entire body requires a Lefty1+ midline barrier to separate the two sides of the embryo, without it, embryos have lethal or congenital LR patterning defects. Individual organs including the brain, heart, and gut also have LR asymmetry, and while the consequences of left and right signals mixing are severe or even lethal, organ-specific mechanisms for separating these signals remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover a midline structure composed of a transient double basement membrane, which separates the left and right halves of the embryonic chick DM during the establishment of intestinal and vascular asymmetries. Unlike other basement membranes of the DM, the midline is resistant to disruption by intercalation of Netrin4 (Ntn4).

Whereas spinal and brainstem circuits implement basic forelimb and orofacial actions, whether there is a specialized cortical circuit that assembles these actions to enable skilled oromanual manipulation remains unclear. Here, we discover a cortical area and its cell-type-specific circuitry that govern oromanual food manipulation in mice. An optogenetic screen of cortical areas and projection neuron types identified a rostral forelimb-orofacial area (RFO), wherein activation of pyramidal tract (PTFezf2) and intratelencephalic (ITPlxnD1) neurons induced concerted posture, forelimb and orofacial movements resembling eating. In a freely moving pasta-eating behavior, pharmacological RFO inactivation impaired the sitting posture, hand recruitment, and oromanual coordination in pasta eating. RFO PTFezf2 and ITPlxnD1 activity was closely correlated with oromanual pasta manipulation and hand-assisted biting. Optogenetic inhibition revealed that PTsFezf2 regulate dexterous hand and mouth movements while ITsPlxnD1 play a more prominent role in oromanual coordination. RFO forms the hub of an extensive network, with reciprocal connections to cortical forelimb and orofacial sensorimotor areas, as well as insular and visceral areas. Within this cortical network, RFO PTsFezf2 project unilaterally to multiple subcortical, brainstem and spinal areas associated with forelimb and orofacial control, while ITsPlxnD1 project bilaterally to the entire network and the ventrolateral striatum, and can mediate concurrent forelimb and mouth movement in part through their striatal projection.

In particular, simplicial homology theory is used to analyze how cognitive representations of space emerge from large conglomerates of independent neuronal contributions. Meanwhile, a growing number of studies suggest that many cognitive functions are sustained by serial patterns of activity. Here, we investigate stashes of such patterns using path homology theory—an impartial, universal approach that does not require a priori assumptions about the sequences’ nature, functionality, underlying mechanisms, or other contexts. We focus on the hippocampus—a key enabler of learning and memory in mammalian brains—and quantify the ordinal arrangement of its activity similarly to how its topology has previously been studied in terms of simplicial homologies. The results reveal that the vast majority of sequences produced during spatial navigation are structurally equivalent to one another. Only a few classes of distinct sequences form an ordinal schema of serial activity that remains stable as the pool of sequences consolidates. Importantly, the structure of both maps is upheld by combinations of short sequences, suggesting that brief activity motifs dominate physiological computations. This ordinal organization emerges and stabilizes on timescales characteristic of spatial learning, displaying similar dynamics. Yet, the ordinal maps generally do not reflect topological affinities—spatial and sequential analyses address qualitatively different aspects of spike flows, representing two complementary formats of information processing. Significance statement This study employs path homology theory to examine serial patterns of neuronal activity in the hippocampus, a critical region for learning and memory. While the traditional, simplicial homology approaches used to model cognitive maps, path homology provides a universal framework for analyzing the ordinal arrangement of neuronal sequences without presupposing their nature or function. The findings reveal that a limited number of distinct sequence classes, supported by combinations of short activity motifs, form a stable ordinal schema over timescales corresponding to periods of spatial learning. Notably, the ordinal maps derived from these sequences do not capture topological affinities, highlighting that spatial and sequential analyses address distinct but complementary dimensions of neural information processing.', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'gs://arxiv-dataset/arxiv/arxiv/pdf/2502/2502.05680v1.pdf', 'authorName': 'A.

There is a close connection between gut microbiota and neurological diseases. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has a beneficial effect on reducing intestinal inflammation. So we wondered if abdominal LIPUS stimulation can have a positive impact on weightlessness induced cognitive decline by reducing intestinal dysfunction. The findings revealed that the hind limb unloaded mice exhibited evident disruption in intestinal structure and gut microbial homeostasis, along with impairment in their learning and memory capabilities. However, 4-week abdominal LIPUS treatment improved intestinal function in hind limb unloaded mice, characterized by upregulation of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin expression in the colon, increased diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota, decreased serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and increased short chain fatty acids in colon contents. The hind limb unloaded mice treated with LIPUS exhibited heightened activity levels, improved exploratory tendencies, and significantly enhanced learning and memory faculties, and elevated expression of neuroadaptation-related proteins such as PSD95, GAP43, P-CREB, BDNF, and its receptor TRKB in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the hind limb unloaded mice receiving fecal transplants from the mice whose abdomens were irradiated with LIPUS displayed enhanced cognitive abilities and improved intestinal structure, akin to the outcomes observed in hind limb unloaded mice who received LIPUS abdominal treatment directly. The above results indicate that LIPUS enhances intestinal structure and microbiota, which helps alleviate cognitive impairment caused by weightlessness.

Our previous study has suggested that the X escapee genes Kdm6a and Kdm5c are involved in microglial activation after stroke in aged mice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that Kdm6a/5c demethylate H3K27Me3/H3K4Me3 in microglia, respectively, and mediate the transcription of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and IRF4, leading to microglial pro-inflammatory responses and exacerbated stroke injury. Aged (17-20\\xa0months) Kdm6a/5c microglial conditional knockout (CKO) female mice (one allele of the gene) were subjected to a 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Gene floxed females (two alleles) and males (one allele) were included as controls. Infarct volume and behavioral deficits were quantified 3\\xa0days after stroke. Immune responses including microglial activation and infiltration of peripheral leukocytes in the ischemic brain were assessed by flow cytometry. Epigenetic modification of IRF5/4 by Kdm6a/5c was analyzed by CUT&RUN assay. The demethylation of H3K27Me3 by kdm6a increased IRF5 transcription; meanwhile, Kdm5c demethylated H3K4Me3 to repress IRF5. Both Kdm6afl/fl and Kdm5cfl/fl mice had worse stroke outcomes compared to fl/y and CKO mice. Gene floxed females showed more robust expression of CD68 in microglia and elevated brain and plasma levels of IL-1β or TNF-α, after stroke.

In this study, we sought to understand how the rodent EPN might be coding kinematic, reward, and difficulty parameters, particularly during locomotion. Furthermore, we aimed to understand the level of movement representation: whole-body or specific body parts. To this end, mice were trained in a freely moving two-alternative forced choice task with two periods of displacement (return and go trajectories) and performed electrophysiological recordings together with video-based tracking. We found (1) robust reward coding but not difficulty. (2) Spatio-temporal variables better explain EPN activity during movement compared to kinematic variables, while both types of variables were more robustly represented in reward-related movement. (3) Reward-sensitive units encode kinematics similarly to reward-insensitive ones. (4) Population dynamics that best account for differences between these two periods of movement can be explained by allocentric references like distance to reward port. (5) The representation of paw and licks is not mutually exclusive, discarding a somatotopic muscle-level representation of movement in the EPN. Our data suggest that EPN activity represents movements and reward in a complex way: highly multiplexed, influenced by the objective of the displacement, where trajectories that lead to reward better represent spatial and kinematic variables.

The synthesis of the proinflammatory proteins CD40 and NLRP3 depends on the canonical NF-κB cascade as the genes encoding CD40 and NLRP3 are transcribed by the phosphorylated NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer in LPS-induced microglia. Exosomes, which are nanosized vesicles (40–150 nm) involved in intercellular communication, are implicated in many pathophysiological processes. Human breast milk, which is rich in exosomes, plays a vital role in neonatal immune system maturation and adaptation. Activated microglia may cause brain-associated injuries or disorders; therefore, we hypothesize that human breast milk-derived exosomes (HBME) attenuate LPS-induced activation of CD40 and NLRP3 by decreasing p38 MAPK and NF-κB p50/p65 activation/phosphorylation downstream of TLR4 in murine microglia (BV2). Human microglia (HMC3) showed a significant decrease in p65 phosphorylation. We isolated purified HBME and characterized them using nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and western blots. Analysis of microglia exposed to LPS and HBME indicated that HBME modulated the expression of signaling molecules in the canonical NF-κB pathway, including MyD88, IκBα, p38 MAPK, NF-κB p65, and their products CD40, NLRP3, and cytokines IL-1β and IL-10.

However, realization of this potential has been limited by gaps in our knowledge of how ctACS affects cerebellar output on single cell and population levels. Previously, we showed that AC stimulation applied to the cerebellar surface produced a strong, frequency-dependent modulation of Purkinje cell (PC) and cerebellar nuclear (CN) cell activity. Here, to approximate more closely the ctACS conditions, we investigated how AC stimulation applied to the external skull surface overlying crus 1 altered PC and CN activity in anesthetized adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. PC and CN activity showed a frequency-dependent modulation in response to ctACS at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 80\\xa0Hz. A unimodal response was seen for most PCs across all frequencies, whereas most CN cells transitioned to bimodal patterns as stimulus frequency increased. The frequency-dependence of the phases of the local minima of the CN cell modulation were consistent with CN cells being driven synaptically by PC activity. Furthermore, comparison of responses with ipsilateral and contralateral placement of the stimulus electrode with respect to the recording site showed that the strength and pattern of the entrainment depended on the stimulus electrode location, suggesting that\\xa0ctACS electrode placement could be used to target specific cerebellar output channels. In sum, the results show that transcranial stimulation of the cerebellar cortex can modulate cerebellar output, which has potential implications for its use in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5147104/latest.pdf', 'authorName': 'Devry Mourra,Angela M.

Whereas mechanisms involved in vasodilation are well-documented, those controlling vasoconstriction remain overlooked. This study unravels the mechanisms by which pyramidal cells elicit arteriole vasoconstriction. Using patch-clamp recording, vascular and Ca2+ imaging in mouse cortical slices, we show that strong optogenetic activation of layer II/III pyramidal cells induces vasoconstriction, correlating with firing frequency and somatic Ca2+ increase. Ex vivo and in vivo pharmacological investigations indicate that this vasoconstriction predominantly recruits prostaglandin E2 through the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway, and activation of EP1 and EP3 receptors. We also present evidence that specific interneurons releasing neuropeptide Y, and astrocytes, through 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, contribute to this process. By revealing the mechanisms by which pyramidal cells lead to vasoconstriction, our findings shed light on the complex regulation of neurovascular coupling. Significance statement Cerebral blood flow is tightly controlled by neuronal activity, a process termed neurovascular coupling which serves as the physiological basis for functional brain imaging widely used to map neuronal activity in health and diseases. While the prevailing view links increased neuronal activity with enhanced blood perfusion, our data suggest that elevated neuronal activity can also reduce cerebral blood flow. By optically controlling the activity of pyramidal cells, we demonstrate that these excitatory neurons induce vasoconstriction when their action potential firing is increased by releasing glutamate and lipid messengers. These findings update the interpretation of functional brain imaging signals and help to better understand the etiopathogenesis of epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, in which hyperactivity, hypoperfusion and cognitive deficits overlap.', 'publicationYear': 2025, 'influentialCitationCount': 0.0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://hal.science/hal-04727642v1/file/2024.03.27.586974v3.full.pdf', 'authorName': 'Benjamin Le Gac,Marine Tournissac,Esther Belzic,Sandrine Picaud,Isabelle Dusart,H.

Previously, we developed an automated cell identification method called CRF_ID and demonstrated its high performance in Caenorhabditis elegans whole-brain images (Chaudhary et al., 2021). However, because the method was optimized for whole-brain imaging, comparable performance could not be guaranteed for application in commonly used C. elegans multi-cell images that display a subpopulation of cells. Here, we present an advancement, CRF_ID 2.0, that expands the generalizability of the method to multi-cell imaging beyond whole-brain imaging. To illustrate the application of the advance, we show the characterization of CRF_ID 2.0 in multi-cell imaging and cell-specific gene expression analysis in C. elegans.

This continuous inflammatory response culminates in neuroimmune-endocrine dysregulation responsible for the metabolic abnormalities and morbidities observed in individuals with MetS. Events such as the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue, increased plasma concentrations of free fatty acids, tissue hypoxia, and sympathetic hyperactivity in individuals with MetS may contribute to the activation of the innate immune response, which compromises cerebral microcirculation and the neurovascular unit, leading to the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effects of chronic treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (semaglutide) on cerebral microcirculation and neurovascular unit (NVU) integrity. Methods C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard normolipidic diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks and then treated for 4 weeks with semaglutide (HFD SEMA) or saline solution (HFD SAL). At the end of pharmacological treatment, biochemical analyses, immunohistochemistry analysis, and intravital microscopy of the brain microcirculation were carried out to quantify leukocyte–endothelium interactions and to assess structural capillary density, astrocyte coverage on cerebral vessels and microglial activation. Results We observed that SEMA attenuates high-fat diet-induced metabolic alterations in mice fed with HFD for 24 weeks. SEMA also reversed cerebral microcirculation effects of HFD by reducing capillary rarefaction and the interaction of leukocytes in postcapillary brain venules. The HFD-SEMA group exhibited improved astrocyte coverage on vessels. However, SEMA did not reverse microglial activation. Conclusions Semaglutide can reverse microvascular rarefaction in metabolic syndrome by restoring the integrity of the neurovascular unit. Adverse dietary stimuli can compromise microglial homeostasis that is not reversed by semaglutide.

Decoupled access/execute (DAE) is a common technique to tackle this problem. It relies on the compiler to separate memory address generation from the rest of the program, however, such a separation is not always possible due to control and data dependencies between the access and execute slices, resulting in a loss of decoupling. In this paper, we present compiler support for speculation in DAE architectures that preserves decoupling in the face of control dependencies. We speculate memory requests in the access slice and poison mis-speculations in the execute slice without the need for replays or synchronization. Our transformation works on arbitrary, reducible control flow and is proven to preserve sequential consistency. We show that our approach applies to a wide range of architectural work on CPU/GPU prefetchers, CGRAs, and accelerators, enabling DAE on a wider range of codes than before. CCS Concepts: • Hardware → Emerging languages and compilers; • Software and its engineering → Compilers. Keywords: decoupled access/execute; compiler speculation 1 Introduction Irregular codes are characterized by data-dependent memory accesses and control flow, for example: Figure 1. A decoupled access/execute architecture template. This code has unpredictable control flow that causes frequent branch mis-predictions on CPUs and thread divergence on GPUs. Because of these limitations, and challenges with Moore’s Law and Dennard performance scaling, computer architects are interested in adding CPU/GPU structures to accelerate such code patterns, or even to use accelerators specialized for a given algorithm [26]. Many of the proposed architectures follow the decades-old idea of a Decoupled Access/Execute (DAE) architecture shown in Figure 1. In DAE, memory accesses are decoupled from computation to avoid stalls resulting from unpredictable loads [51]. The address generation unit (AGU) sends load and store requests to the data unit (DU), while the DU sends load values to and receives store values from the compute unit (CU). All communication is FIFO based and ideally the AGU to DU communication is one-directional, allowing the Figure 2. Comparison of a decoupled and non-decoupled address generation. Non-decoupled address generation re- sults in a later arrival of the store address, which stalls the RAW check for the next load, lowering load throughput. address streams from the AGU to run ahead w.r.t the CU. Figure 1a shows an example of such a DAE architecture implementing the earlier code snippet. DAE is a general technique applicable to many computa- tional models: it is used in specialized FPGA accelerators gen- erated from High-Level Synthesis (HLS) [11–13, 15, 16, 21, 54, 55]; in Coarse Grain Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) [20, 27, 37, 39, 43, 45, 46, 61]; and in CPU/GPU prefetchers [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47, 59]. For example, NVIDIA introduced hardware-accelerated asynchronous memory copies [3]. The CUDA programmer can provide a “copy descriptor” of a ten- sor to copy and the hardware will run ahead and generate the corresponding addresses in a Tensor Memory Unit. The common denominator of all these works is that they rely on either the programmer or the compiler to decouple address-generating instructions from the rest of the program. However, it has long been recognized that such a decoupling is not always possible [9, 57]. If any of the address-generating instructions for array A depend on a value loaded from A, then there is a loss-of-decoupling (LoD) [25]. Access patterns such as A[f(A[i])] are rare, but control dependencies that involve loads from A are common. For example, consider replacing C[i] with A[i] in our running example: Here, there is a LoD, because the A store is control-dependent on a branch that loads from A. Whereas before the load from C could be prefetched, now the AGU/DU communication is synchronized, because the AGU waits for A values from the DU before deciding if a store address should be generated, as shown in Figure 1b. In turn, the load waits for the store address to ensure that there is no aliasing—the store address is needed for memory disambiguation. As a result, the AGU cannot run ahead of the CU anymore, resulting in decreased pipeline parallelism, which Figure 2 illustrates. One approach for restoring decoupling in this case is con- trol speculation. As shown in Figure 1c, we can hoist the store request out of the if -condition in the AGU (specula- tion), and later poison the store in the CU on mis-speculation (store invalidation). However, it is unclear how the compiler should coordinate the speculation and recovery transfor- mations across two distinct control-flow graphs. While the example from Figure 1c is trivial, the task quickly becomes complicated with more speculated stores and nested control flow, as we demonstrate in the next section. The key chal- lenge here is to guarantee that the order of store requests sent from the AGU matches the order of store values or kill signals sent from the CU on all control-flow paths. General compiler support for speculated stores in DAE architectures is an open question that we tackle in this paper, making the following contributions: • We give a formal description of the fundamental rea- sons why address generation cannot always be decou- pled from the rest of the program (§4). • We describe compiler support for speculative memory in DAE architectures, solving the LoD problem due to control dependencies. We propose two algorithms: one for speculating memory requests in the AGU, and one for poisoning mis-speculations in the CU (§5). • We prove that our speculation approach preserves the sequential consistency of the original program and does not introduce deadlocks (§6). • We show that our work enables DAE on a wider class of codes than before, with applications in CPU/GPU prefetchers, CGRAs, and FPGA accelerators. • We evaluate our DAE speculation approach on accel- erators generated from HLS implementing codes from the graph and data analytics domain. We achieve an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup over the baseline HLS implementations. We show that our approach has no mis-speculation penalty and minimal code size impact (average accelerator area increase < 5%) (§8). 2 Motivating Example In this brief section, we show why an obvious approach to speculation in DAE architectures is incorrect. The FIFO-based nature of DAE requires that the order of memory requests (speculative or not) generated in the AGU matches exactly the order of load/store values (poisoned or not) in the CU. The motivating example in Figure 1c contains just one speculative store and one path through the compute CFG where the speculation becomes unreachable, making the problem of ordering trivial in that case. Consider the more complex code in Figure 3a with three stores 𝑠0, 𝑠1, and 𝑠2. Speculating all store requests in the AGU might result in the store request order (𝑠2, 𝑠0, 𝑠1). In the CU, we need to guarantee the same order of corresponding store values (poisoned or not) on every possible control-flow path through the loop. Unfortunately, the obvious approach that worked for the trivial example in Figure 1c does not work Figure 3. Poisoning speculated stores immediately when they become unreachable results in an ordering mismatch between AGU store requests from and CU store values. here. If we poison values at points where the corresponding speculation becomes unreachable, as illustrated in Figure 3b, then we end up with three possible orderings of store values depending on the CFG path in the CU, but only one of the orderings is correct. This is why any previous implemen- tations of speculative stores in DAE architectures has only considered trivial triangle or diamond shaped CFGs [24], like the one in Figure 1c. Generalized compiler support for store speculation that guarantees the correct order of poisoning is the key challenge that we solve in this paper. 3 Background In this section, we describe the architectural support needed to enable speculative DAE and some compiler preliminaries. Our speculation technique requires architectural support for predicated stores and FIFOs. Store values are tagged with a poison bit that, when set, causes the corresponding store request to be dropped in the DU without committing a store. We say that a store request gets killed (or poisoned) if its corresponding store value has the poison bit set. This is a lightweight form of speculation that does not require replays in the CU and does not result in out-of-bounds stores, be- cause mis-speculated stores are never committed. Speculative loads can be supported by simply discarding the value of a mis-speculated load. Predicated stores are easy to support in hardware since the underlying memory protocol usually already uses a valid signal. For example, the commonly used AXI4 interface [4] has a strobe signal to indicate which bytes are valid. Architectural FIFOs (queues) are also commonly added in works on CPU/GPU microarchitecture or can be relatively cheaply implemented in software. For example, works on DAE CPU/GPU prefetchers add architectural FIFOs and ex- tend the ISA with instructions for producing load/store ad- dresses and consuming/producing store values [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47]. The prefetcher from [24] enables predicated stores with a store_inv instruction, but the authors support only simple triangle or diamond control flow patterns, calling for future work on general speculation support. We discuss concrete ex- amples of architectures that can benefit from our work in §7. We evaluate our work on accelerators generated from HLS, where we have complete control of the memory interfaces. We use an SSA-based compiler representation and associated analyses [49]. In particular, we use the control-flow graph and dominator tree to calculate control dependencies [40], and we use the SSA def-use chain for data dependencies. We use a canonical loop representation: loops have a sin- gle header block and a single loop backedge going from the loop latch to the loop header. Our transformation assumes re- ducible control flow—CFG edges can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, forward and back edges, such that the forward edges form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Irreducible con- trol flow can be made reducible with node splitting [7, 44]. For completeness, we briefly describe how our compiler implements a DAE architecture: 1. AGU: For each memory operation to be decoupled, we change it to a send_ld_addr or a send_st_addr function that sends the memory address to the DU. 2. CU: Dually, in the CU we change each decoupled mem- ory operation to a consume_val or produce_val func- tion that receives or sends values to or from the DU. 3. Dead Code Elimination: We run a standard DCE pass in the CU to remove the now unnecessary address generation code. In the AGU, we delete all side effect instructions that are not part of the address generation def-use chains, and then also run a standard DCE pass. We also use a control-flow simplification pass that removes empty blocks potentially created by DCE. The send_ld_addr, send_st_addr, consume_val, and produce_val functions are implementation dependent. For example, if we target CPU/GPU prefetchers, such as [17, 24], then these would translate to instructions. For accelerators, they would be translated to FIFO writes/reads. 4 Loss-of-Decoupling Analysis LoD events arise when the address generation for a given memory access depends on a load that cannot be trivially prefetched, causing the AGU, DU, and CU communication to be synchronized. By non-trivially prefetched we mean loads that have a RAW hazards, i.e., the DU needs to receive all previous store addresses in program order to perform memory disambiguation before executing the load. Given a set of address-generating instructions 𝐺, and a set of memory load instructions 𝐴 using addresses generated by instructions in 𝐺, there is a loss of decoupling if: Definition 4.1 (LoD Data Dependency). There exists a path in the def-use chain from 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 to 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺. While en- countering a 𝜙-node on the def-use chain leading to 𝑔, we also trace the def-use paths of the terminator instructions 𝑇 in the 𝜙-node incoming basic blocks to see if any terminator instruction in 𝑇 depends on any 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴. Definition 4.2 (LoD Control Dependency). There exists an instruction 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺 that is control-dependent on a branch instruction 𝑏, and there is a path in the def-use chain from 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 to 𝑏. We call the basic block that contains 𝑏 the LoD control dependency source. Note that the LoD control dependency source need not be the immediate control dependency of 𝑔, and that 𝑔 might have multiple LoD control dependencies. Depending on the hardware context, the definition of the 𝐴 set can be expanded or narrowed. For example, if the AGU is implemented in hardware with limited control flow support, then 𝐴 could include all branch instructions. On the other hand, given an address generating instruction, we could limit 𝐴 to only include loads from the same array for which the given address is generated—this could be useful if we only want to preserve decoupling for that array and do not care about losing decoupling for other arrays. Our speculation technique applies equally well to all these definitions. An example of a LoD data dependency is the A[f(A[i])] access. Our speculation approach does not recover decou- pling for such cases, but fortunately such accesses are rare. An example of a more common LoD data dependency is the code pattern if (A[i]) A[i++] = 1. In this case, the def-use chain leading to the definition of the store address contains a 𝜙-node (i) whose value depends on loading from 𝐴. Such a pattern is sometimes found in algorithms that operate on dy- namically growing data structures, e.g. queues or stacks. Our speculation technique does not work on such cases either, but this is not a large limitation, since performance oriented codes typically do not use dynamically growing structures, instead opting for implementations with bounded space re- quirements that can be allocated statically [62]. An example of LoD due to a control dependency is shown in Figure 1b. This case is much more common than a direct data dependency and is the focus of this paper. Algorithm 1 Control-flow hoisting of AGU requests 1: Input: 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 list of blocks that are the source of a LoD control dependency (defined in §4) 2: Output: 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 { basic block: list of hoisted re- quests to this block } 3: 4: for 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 do 5: 6: ⊲ traverse the DAG from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch for 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 (𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵) do if 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 contains memory requests then hoist 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 requests to the end of 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 add requests to 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 [𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵] 5 Compiler Support for Speculation We now describe our dual transformations that enable spec- ulation in the AGU and poison mis-speculations in the CU. Algorithm 1 describes our approach to introducing specu- lation in the AGU. Given a LoD control dependency source block 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 we hoist all memory requests that are control de- pendent on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the end of 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. There can be multiple blocks with memory requests that have a LoD control depen- dency on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵, which poses the question in which order should they be hoisted to 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. We use reverse post-order in Algorithm 1. Assuming reducible control flow, the CFG region from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch is a DAG. The reverse post-order of a DAG is its topological order. Topological ordering gives us the useful property that given two distinct basic blocks 𝐴 and 𝐵 in a given loop, if 𝐴 ≺ 𝐵 in any path through the loop then 𝐴 ≺ 𝐵 in the topological ordering. Note that there can be multiple topological orderings for a DAG, but it does not matter which one is chosen in our algorithm. Algorithm 1 traverses the CFG region from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the end of its loop (or to the end of the function if 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 is not in a loop). During the traversal, we ignore CFG edges leading to loop headers—we do not enter loops other than the innermost loop containing 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. 5.1.1 Example of Hoisting. Consider the CFG from Fig- ure 4a. There are three LoD control dependency source blocks (2, 3, 5) and five blocks with memory requests (blocks 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 with requests 𝑎, 𝑐, 𝑏, 𝑑, 𝑒, respectively). Assume that each block holds a single memory request—multiple memory requests within the same block are treated in the same way by our algorithms. Figure 4c shows the topological order of the loop (block 1 is omitted for brevity). Algorithm 1 will hoist 𝑏, 𝑒 to the end of block 2, and 𝑐, 𝑑, 𝑒 to the end of block 3—the result is presented in Figure 4b. Note that the requests 𝑏 and 𝑒 were hoisted to both block 2 and 3, because they are reachable from both blocks. Nothing is hoisted to block 1 since it is not a LoD control dependency source. Figure 4. An example of introducing speculative memory requests in the AGU (§5.1); and poisoned stores in the CU (§5.2). Block 6 in subfigure (d) kills stores c, b, then uses the allocation for store d, and then kills store e. 5.1.2 Nested LoD Control Dependencies. Block 5 in Figure 4b does not contain any speculative requests because it itself has a LoD control dependency on block 2 and 3. Algorithm 1 considers only LoD control dependency source blocks that are not themselves the destination of another LoD control dependency. Given a chain of nested LoD control dependencies, we only consider the chain head. For example, the Figure 4a CFG has two LoD control dependency chains: 2, 5 and 3, 5—Algorithm 1 considers only blocks 2 and 3. Algorithm 2 Mapping Poison Stores to CFG Edges in CU 1: Input: 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 { basic block: list of requests hoisted to this block in Algorithm 1 } for 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ ∈ 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑇𝑜𝐿𝑜𝑜𝑝𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵) do 2: 3: for 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵, 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 ∈ 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 do 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ← block where 𝑟 is true 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠.𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 (𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵) 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 ← ∅ for 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 do ⊲ set keeps insertion order 5.1.3 Why Topological Order in Algorithm 1? Topo- logical order is needed to make it possible to match the order of speculative requests made in the AGU with the order of values that will arrive from the CU on all its possible CFG paths. Consider, for example, the requests 𝑏 and 𝑐 in Fig- ure 4a. We first want to hoist 𝑐 to block 3 before hoisting 𝑏, because there exists a CFG path where 𝑐 comes before 𝑏, but not vice versa. If 𝑏 were hoisted before 𝑐, then the speculative requests order would be 𝑏 ≺ 𝑐, which would be impossible to match with values in the CU on the CFG path 3, 5, 7. for 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ∈ 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ do for 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 do if 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 then ⊲ to the next edge if 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 not reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 then ⊲ reachability ignores loop backedges poison 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 requests on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ⊲ Alg. 3 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠.𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒 (𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵) Our strategy for poisoning misspeculations in the CU is to first map a poison call to a CFG edge, and then to map that edge to a poison store call contained in an existing or newly created basic block. Algorithm 2 describes the first step. Given block 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 that contains speculative memory requests 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠, we consider each path in the DAG from the 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch (or function exit) in the CU. We call the block where a 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 becomes true the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 (for example, the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 for request 𝑏 in Figure 4a is block 5). For each CFG path, we use the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 list to keep track of which requests were already used or poisoned on the path—the list contains the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 for each 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠. Given an edge in the traversal, the edge is skipped if the next 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 is still reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . This guarantees that the order of speculative requests in the AGU matches the order of values in the CU, i.e., a speculative request for a given 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 block is not poisoned immedi- ately when 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 becomes unreachable if there is an earlier speculative request that can still be used. 5.2.1 Example of Mapping Poison Stores to CFG Edges. Figure 4c shows which CFG edges are poisoned given the original CFG in Figure 4a and the AGU CFG in Figure 4b. For Algorithm 3 Poisoning Stores on Edges in CU 1: Input: store request 𝑟 ; CFG 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒; block 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 where 𝑟 was speculated; block 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 where 𝑟 is true ⊲ preserve set across calls get from 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒 if exists 2: 3: 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒 ← ∅ 4: if 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 is reachable from 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 then 5: 6: 7: 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 ← create new block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 or append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the end of 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒.𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 (𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵) 8: 9: else if 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 does not dominate 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 then 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 ← create new block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 10: append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the end of 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 11: 12: 13: create 𝜙 (1, 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵) value in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 branch from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 on 𝜙 = 1 ⊲ create recursively on 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 → 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 paths append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the start of 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 example, the path 3 → 5 → 𝐿 will have: 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) on the 3 → 5 edge; and 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑑), 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑒) on the 5 → 𝐿 edge (4th path from block 3 in Figure 4c). 5.2.2 Mapping Poisoned Edges to Basic Blocks. Algo- rithm 3 shows how poisoned CFG edges are mapped to actual poison calls placed in a concrete basic block. Given a poi- soned request 𝑟 on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 (from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 block to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 block), the 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 block where 𝑟 was speculated in the AGU, and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 where r becomes true there are three cases: 1. There exists a path from 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . In this case, we cannot insert 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , because we would end up with a CFG path where the store is both true and poisoned. To avoid this, we create a new 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to it. 2. There exists a path from the loop header to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 that does not contain 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵. In this case, we cannot insert 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , because we would end up with a CFG path where 𝑟 was not speculated in the AGU, but was poisoned in the CU. To avoid this, we create a new block 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 on the edge and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to it. We also add steering instructions to the path from 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 that will branch from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 only if 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 was encountered on the current CFG path. 3. Otherwise, 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) can safely be prepended to the start of 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . Algorithm 3 is executed only once per (𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒, 𝑟 ) tuple—a given request is poisoned at most once on a given edge. Also, poison blocks created in case 1 in Algorithm 3 can be reused to poison other requests. Figure 5. Basic blocks with the same list of poison stores and the same immediate successor can be merged in the CU. 5.2.3 Example of Mapping Poison Edges to Blocks. Consider how the poisoned edges in Figure 4c are mapped to basic blocks in Figure 4d. Case 1: Store 𝑐 is poisoned on the 3 → 5 edge. Since there is a path from the true block of 𝑐 (block 4) to the edge destination block (block 5), we create a new block on the 3 → 5 edge and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) to it. Case 2: Store 𝑑 is poisoned on both the 5 → 7 and 5 → 𝐿 edges. The 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 for 𝑑 is block 3. Since there exists the path 𝐻 → 1 → 2 → 5 that does not contain block 3, we create a new block on the 5 → 7 edge with the 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑑) call. We add steering instructions to the 3 → 5 and 3 → 4 → 5 paths that will cause block 5 to branch to the new poison block on the 5 → 7 edge only if block 5 was reached from a path containing block 3. Case 3: Store 𝑐 is also poisoned on the 3 → 6 edge, but here it is safe to prepend 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) to the start of block 6. Case 1 and 2 of Algorithm 3 might create multiple poison blocks for the same store on different CFG edges. It is possible to merge two poison blocks into one if they contain the same list of poison stores and if they have the same list of immediate successors. When merging, we keep instructions from just one block. We apply such merging iteratively after Algorithms 2 and 3. For example, Figure 5 contains a CFG sub- region of our running example from Figure 4. Algorithm 3 inserted poison blocks 10, 11, 12, 13 to poison stores 𝑑 and 𝑒. Block pairs (11, 13) and (10, 12) can be merged. Speculative loads are relatively easy to support. To match the order of load_consume calls in the CU with the order of speculative send_load_addr calls in the AGU we can hoist the load_consume calls to the same block where the corresponding send_load_addr were hoisted in the AGU. Then, the CU can either use the load value or discard it. After hoisting, we need to update all 𝜙 instructions that use the load value, since the basic block containing the loaded value will have changed. Alternatively, we can transform 𝜙 instructions using the load value into select instructions. 6 Safety and Liveness We prove that our transformations preserve the sequential consistency of the original program and that they do not introduce deadlock. Deadlock freedom is a corollary of se- quential consistency, so we focus only on the latter. We show that on every CFG path the order of speculative store requests in the AGU matches the order of store values in the CU, and that the non-poisoned store value sequence in the CU matches the store sequence of the original code. In the following discussion, we assume blocks with a sin- gle store; the proof trivially extends to blocks with multi- ple stores since all speculative stores in the same block are treated the same. We also assume that all stores are specula- tive, since the relative order between non-speculative and speculative stores is guaranteed by definition: given a a non- speculative store 𝑠1 and a speculative store 𝑠2, Algorithm 1 will not change the relative program order of 𝑠1 and 𝑠2, i.e., if 𝑠1 ≺ 𝑠2 in the original program order, then it is not possible to hoist 𝑠2 such that 𝑠2 ≺ 𝑠1. This follows from the con- trol dependency definition (§4)—𝑠2 hoisting stops at its LoD control dependency source 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵, which must come after the block containing 𝑠1 in topological order. If 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 would come after 𝑠1 in topological order, then the block containing 𝑠1 would also have a LoD control dependency on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 and would have been hoisted, which is a contradiction since we assumed that 𝑠1 was non-speculative. A similar argument can be made if 𝑠2 ≺ 𝑠1 in the original program. Lemma 6.1 (Sequential Consistency). Given an ordered list of 𝑛 speculative store requests 𝐿𝑎 = {𝑎0, 𝑎1, ..., 𝑎𝑛−1} made in the AGU loop CFG on some fixed iteration 𝑘, Algorithms 2 and 3 transform the CU CFG such that every possible path through its loop CFG on iteration 𝑘 produces an or- dered list of 𝑛 tagged store values 𝐿𝑣 = {(𝑣0, 𝑝0), (𝑣1, 𝑝1), ..., (𝑣𝑛−1, 𝑝𝑛−1)}, such that each (𝑎𝑖, 𝑣𝑖, 𝑝𝑖 ), 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛 triple cor- responds to a 𝐴[𝑎𝑖 ] ← 𝑣𝑖 store in the original program CFG, and 𝑝𝑖 = 1 (poison bit) if that store is not executed on the path through the original loop CFG on iteration 𝑘. Proof. We use a proof by induction on the transformed CFG. Base case: 𝐿𝑎 = ∅ (no speculated requests in the AGU). Algorithm 2 does not change the CU CFG. Thus, the order of store addresses in the AGU and store values in the CU trivially matches, 𝐿𝑎 = 𝐿𝑣 = ∅. Inductive hypothesis: assume Lemma 6.1 holds at basic block 𝐵𝑖 in the current CFG path. All store requests 𝑎 𝑗 ∈ 𝐿𝑎 contained in blocks reached before 𝐵𝑖 in the path were matched with the correct store value call (𝑣 𝑗, 𝑝 𝑗 ) ∈ 𝐿𝑣, such that 𝑝 𝑗 = 1 if 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗 ] ← 𝑣 𝑗 was not executed on the path in the original loop CFG. Inductive step: The next store address in the AGU 𝐿𝑎 se- quence is 𝑎 𝑗+1 ∈ 𝐿𝑎. The next store value in the CU CFG path should be (𝑣 𝑗+1, 𝑝 𝑗+1) ∈ 𝐿𝑣, where 𝑝 𝑗+1 = 1 iff the store 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗+1] ← 𝑣 𝑗+1 is not reached on the current CFG path in the original program. Algorithm 2 considers the 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 → 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 next. There are three cases: 1. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵, where 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is the block contain- ing the store 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗+1] ← 𝑣 𝑗+1 in the original program CFG. In this case, Algorithm 2 will not poison this store on this path through the CU CFG, i.e., the next item in the 𝐿𝑣 sequence will be the correct (𝑣 𝑗, 0). 2. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 ≠ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is not reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , in which case Algorithm 2 will insert a poison store on this edge. Algorithm 3 will map this poison store to a basic block, with the effect that taking the 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 will result in the poison call being executed and control transferring to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . The next item in the 𝐿𝑣 sequence will be the correct (𝑣 𝑗, 1). 3. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 ≠ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is reachable from 𝐵𝑙 , in which case Algorithm 2 will traverse the path until Case 1 or 2 is matched. Since Lemma 6.1 holds for the base case, for basic blocks on the path up to 𝐵𝑖 , and for some successor block of 𝐵𝑖 , it must hold at any block on the path. If it holds at any block on the path, it holds for the whole path. Since a given store request 𝑟 is poisoned at most once on a given CFG edge and since, by definition of Algorithm 2, any given path will contain at most one edge where 𝑟 is poisoned, we conclude □ that Lemma 6.1 holds for all paths. 7 Applications In this section, we highlight three applications for our work: DAE-based prefetchers in CPUs/GPUs, CGRAs, and special- ized accelerators generated from HLS. In the next section, we choose HLS as an evaluation vehicle due to its simplicity compared to CPU/GPU prefetchers where the evaluation results can easily be polluted by other architectural factors like cache behavior, branch prediction, etc. However, we em- phasize that our speculation support in DAE does not rely on any HLS-specific features and can be applied wherever speculation is combined with the DAE technique. Most existing works on CPU/GPU prefetchers follow the DAE principle and rely on the compiler to decoupled address generation from compute [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47]. All of these works suffer from the control-dependency loss of decoupling (LoD) problem (§4). The work in [24] discusses adding spec- ulation and predicated stores to the CPU microarchitecture to mitigate LoD, but their compiler only supports simple diamond and triangle control flow shapes. In this paper, we have demonstrated generalized compiler support for specu- lation in DAE, making these works viable for general control flow and thus applicable to a broader set of codes. 7.1.1 Example. The CPU prefetcher proposed in [24] (on which most of the other work is based) separates address gen- eration from compute and extends the ISA with store_addr, load_produce, store_val, load_consume, and store_inv instructions that can be directly targeted by our compiler. A CGRA consists of an array of PEs, each with small memo- ries, connected by a network. A CGRA compiler is typically co-designed with the hardware, as the PEs are typically stat- ically scheduled. The job of the compiler is to map the Con- trol/Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to the PEs, and many works follow the DAE technique to tackle the memory wall prob- lem [20, 27, 37, 39, 43, 45, 46, 61]. Our work can help mitigate LoD events when mapping to CGRAs. 7.2.1 Example. The CGRA proposed in [39] is an example of a modern streaming dataflow CGRA. All communication in the CGRA is FIFO-based, and address generation is ex- plicitly decoupled at compile time into AGUs. The compiler generates commands to produce address streams, and to consume or produce values. Control flow is handled with predication and there is a SD_Clean_Port command to throw away a value from an output port that can be used to imple- ment predicated stores. In HLS, the CDFG of an algorithm is implemented directly in hardware following a spatial execution model with the freedom to customize the memory system. This makes de- coupling easier in HLS compared to the temporal CPU/GPU execution model. HLS-generated accelerators can directly benefit from our work today without any changes, and it is in this domain that we evaluate our implementation in the next section. Although existing HLS compilers are successful in build- ing non-trivial accelerators for regular code (e.g., [48]), their static scheduling techniques are sub-optimal for irregular codes (for the same reason why traditional VLIW compilers were sub-optimal for irregular codes). Many research works in academia and industry have exploited DAE in HLS to improve the efficiency of HLS-generated accelerators for ir- regular codes [11–13, 15, 16, 21, 53–55]. By adding compiler speculation support, DAE in HLS can be used on a broader set of codes, which we demonstrate in the next section. 8 Evaluation In this section, we answer the following questions: • What is the performance benefit of using a DAE ar- chitecture (enabled by our speculation approach) to accelerate codes with LoD control dependencies? • What is the cost of mis-speculation in our approach? • What is the impact on code size (accelerator area usage) of our speculation approach? • What is the scalability for nested control flow, which increases the number of poison stores and blocks? We make our work and evaluation publicly available [52]. Figure 6. Performance of DAE, SPEC and ORACLE normalized to STA. SPEC achieves an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup. We generate algorithm-specific accelerators using HLS tar- geting an Intel Arria 10 FPGA. The C codes are taken directly from benchmark suites without adding any HLS-specific an- notations (excluding dynamic structures, like queues, that were replaced with HLS-specific libraries). We use the LLVM-based Intel SYCL HLS compiler [29] and apply our standard DAE transformation (§3.2) and our proposed speculation transformation (§5) as LLVM passes. The codes use deterministic dual-ported on-chip SRAM ca- pable of 1 read and 1 write per cycle. To enable out-of-order loads, we use a load-store queue (LSQ) designed for HLS (load/store queue sizes of 4/32), which is commonly found on accelerators for irregular codes [1, 24, 31, 53]. We report cycle counts from ModelSim simulations. We do not report circuit frequency since our approach does not affect the critical path (see [52] for such details). Area usage is obtained after place and route using Quartus 19.2. 8.1.1 Baselines. For each benchmark, we synthesize the following architectures which represent current state-of-the- art approaches to HLS : • STA: the default, industry-grade approach using static scheduling [29]. Loads that cannot be disambiguated at compile time execute in order. • DAE: a DAE architecture without speculation. OoO loads are enabled by an LSQ. This is the state-of-the- art approach to irregular codes in academia [53], but it suffers from control-dependency LoDs. • SPEC: the same as DAE, but with our speculation tech- nique which mitigates control-dependency LoDs. • ORACLE: the same as DAE, but all LoD control depen- dencies are removed manually from the input code. The ORACLE results are wrong, but give a bound on the performance of SPEC and show its area overhead. 8.1.2 Benchmarks. DAE architectures optimize the la- tency between memory and compute and are most beneficial for memory-bound codes [24], especially codes with an irreg- ular memory access pattern that prevents static prefetching [18]. We evaluate nine such benchmarks from the graph and data analytics domain, using the GAP graph benchmark Table 1. Absolute performance and area usage of STA [29], DAE [53], SPEC, and ORACLE accelerators. (*bc uses two LSQs). bfs bc sssp hist thr mm fw sort spmv suite [8] and an HLS benchmark suite [14] of irregular pro- grams. We select only codes that can benefit from our SPEC approach, i.e., codes with LoD control dependencies: • bfs: breadth-first traversal through a graph. • bc: betweenness centrality of a single node in a graph. • sssp: single shortest path from a single node to all other nodes in a graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm. • hist: histogram, similar to Figure 1b (size 1000). • thr: zeroes RGB pixels above threshold (size 1000). • mm: maximal matching in a bipartite graph (2000 edges). • fw: Floyd-Warshall distance calculation of all node-to- node pairs in a dense graph (10×10 distance matrix). • sort: using bitonic mergesort (size 64). • spvm: sparse vector matrix multiply (20×20 matrix). For the graph codes (bfs, bc, sssp) we use a real-world graph email-Eu-core with 1005 nodes and 25,571 edges. Figure 6 reports normalized speedups of each technique over STA. Our SPEC approach gives on average a 1.9× (and up to 3×) speedup over STA. This is within 5% of the ORACLE performance. In contrast, DAE without speculation sees a dramatic performance degradation over STA, because the AGU, DU, CU communication is sequentialized. 8.2.1 Mis-speculation Cost. The SPEC and ORACLE per- formance gap is highest on the bfs and bc codes, because of its deep pipeline between the load and store that form a RAW hazard. The deep pipeline means that more store allocations need to be held by the LSQ to guarantee perfect pipelining [34]. This, together with a high mis-speculation rate in these benchmarks (Table 1), can cause the LSQ to fill with store addresses that are mis-speculated, potentially stalling later loads that have to wait for future store addresses to arrive. This problem can be solved by increasing the store queue size in the LSQ. The increased number of requests and the need for more buffering is one of the limitations of our approach. Codes with a shallower pipeline that do not need large LSQ sizes have no mis-speculation penalty. To prove this, we choose three benchmarks where we can instrument the input data so that we can vary the mis- speculation rate. Table 2 shows how the mis-speculation cost changes as the mis-speculation rate increases. As can be seen, there is no correlation between the mis-speculation rate and cost, with the slight variability in clock cycle counts attributable to the subtle difference in the number of true RAW hazards due to the varying data distribution. Table 2. SPEC cycle counts as mis-speculation rate changes. hist thr mm Mis-speculation rate Our speculation approach can increase the number of blocks in the CU, especially for codes with deeply nested control flow. In HLS, an increased number of blocks can result in a higher area usage due to larger scheduler complexity [50]. Table 1 shows the absolute area usage of all accelerators. We observe virtually no area overhead of SPEC over ORACLE on the evaluated benchmarks. This is because most of the codes have at most two control-flow nesting levels where new poison blocks are inserted, and sometimes it is possible to reduce the number of blocks using our merging technique (e.g., two poison blocks in mm merged into one). 8.3.1 Impact of Nested Control Flow on Area Usage. To give a more meaningful measure of how nested control flow impacts the area overhead of our SPEC approach, we create a synthetic benchmark template where we can tune the number of poison blocks generated by SPEC: for HLS with speculation support [23]. The speculation sup- port in this and other works requires costly recovery on mis-speculation [6, 22, 30, 35, 56, 60]. Efficiently squashing speculative computation on the wrong paths in a spatial dataflow architecture is hard, because the architectural state is distributed [10]. Our speculative DAE sidesteps this issue, not requiring any recovery: we speculate early (run ahead) in the AGU, and later handle mis-speculations in the CU by taking an appropriate path in its CFG. Control-flow handling in GPUs is usually implemented via predication. The algorithms used to calculate predicate masks and re-convergence points resemble our work [32]. The SIMT stack approach in GPUs pushes predicate masks onto a stack when entering a control-flow nesting level, and pops when exiting. Our Algorithm 1 implementing specula- tive requests can be seen as a pass through the CFG with only push operations, where the push is onto individual stacks of control-dependency sources. Dually, our inserting of poison calls in Algorithm 1 can be seen as a pass through the CFG with only pop operations where the placement of the pops follows a certain policy just like modern SIMT compilers fol- low different policies to prevent SIMT deadlock and livelock, or to improve performance [19], instead of popping at the immediate post-dominator. 10 Conclusion We have presented general compiler support for specula- tive memory operations in DAE architectures that tackles the LoD problem resulting from control dependencies. We have proposed CFG transformations implementing specula- tion in the address generation slice, and poisoning of mis- speculations in the compute slice, with a proof of correctness. We have presented three applications where our work im- proves support for the efficient execution of irregular codes: DAE-based CPU/GPU prefetchers that require compiler sup- port, CGRA architectures, and HLS-generated specialized accelerators. We have evaluated our work on HLS-generated accelerators, showing an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup over non-DAE accelerators on a set of irregular benchmarks where DAE is not possible without our speculation. Our ap- proach has no mis-speculation cost and a small code size footprint, scaling well to deeply nested control flow. Future work could investigate vector-parallelism support by filling a vector of speculative requests in the AGU and producing a store mask in the CU, similar to the recent work on decoupled vector runahead prefetching in CPUs [36].

Change in area and performance overhead of SPEC over ORACLE as the number of poison blocks and calls grows. if 𝑥 > 0 then 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒1 if 𝑥 > 1 then 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒2 if 𝑥 > 2 then ... poison calls. Each nesting level in this template will result in one poison block in the SPEC architecture. With 𝑛 stores, and assuming one store per nesting level, there will be 𝑛 poison blocks and 𝑛 𝑖=1 Figure 7 shows how the area and performance overhead of SPEC over ORACLE changes as more poison blocks are needed. The performance overhead is close to 0% and does not change with more poison blocks. The area overhead of the AGU unit is similarly close to 0%, because SPEC hoists stores out of the if -conditions, causing the blocks to be deleted. The area overhead of the CU unit grows by a few percent (< 5%) with each added poison block, but even for the pathological case of eight nested if -conditions the overhead is below 25%. In real codes, with more compute and lower control-flow nesting, the area overhead of SPEC should be minimal. 9 Related Work Program slicing is used beyond DAE architectures. Decoupled Software Pipelining (DSWP) [41] is a popular transforma- tion that decouples strongly connected components in the program dependence graph into separate pipeline stages mapped over multiple PEs communicating via FIFOs. The PEs can be CPU threads, or pipeline stages in an accelerator generated by HLS [33]. Control dependent pipeline stages in DSWP can also be executed speculatively, although stages with memory operations require versioned memory [58]. Control speculation has its roots in compilers for VLIW ma- chines. Instruction scheduling in HLS is very similar to VLIW scheduling (no hardware support for speculation, static map- ping to functional units, etc.), with many algorithms like modulo-scheduling and if -conversion originally developed for VLIW directly applicable to HLS [2, 42, 50]. Most recently, predicated execution in the form of gated SSA was proposed',\n",

E-mail(s): hhezju@zju.edu.cn; xinian.zuo@bnu.edu.cn; †These authors contributed equally to this work. The amygdala is indispensable for mood regulation, cognitive learning, and memory consolidation, and has been closely associated with behavioral pathologies, particularly during critical stages of socio-emotional maturation such as childhood and adoles- cence (Sammallahti et al, 2023; Chai et al, 2023; Par´e and Headley, 2023). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain tissue structures enables a detailed examination and volumetric analysis of the amygdala, facilitating the construction of developmental neuropsychiatric conditions (Song, 2023; Ben-Zion et al, 2023). Therefore, a volumetric analysis based on a precise segmentation of the amygdala is essential for these studies. Amygdala segmentation has relied on histological atlases and manual segmen- tation techniques utilizing in vivo neuroimaging data. However, while serving as a golden standard, these methods predominantly involve manual labeling, making them labor intensive and prone to errors. Given the necessity to process large datasets, this task becomes particularly cumbersome and requires the development of automatic segmentation methods. A frequently used technique in automatic methods involves probabilistic estimates derived from Markov random fields (Fischl et al, 2002) to assign voxel labels in anatomical MRI images. This approach has been widely implemented in popular software such as FreeSurfer (Fischl et al, 2002), achieving notable segmen- tation performance (Trombini et al, 2023). Other research has used Bayesian methods to delineate brain anatomical boundaries (Patenaude et al, 2011), based on the sig- nal intensity of MRI images and the structural configurations defined by established atlases, such as those used in FSL-FIRST and similar segmentation algorithms (Liu and Chou, 2023). In addition, multi-atlas label fusion segmentation techniques (Xie et al, 2023) integrate information from multiple atlases to reduce mislabeling errors resulting from inaccurate registrations and mitigate the inherent instability of MRI data. This methodology has proven particularly effective in scenarios involving high variability in Markov random fields covering individual disparities and pathological lesions, and has been incorporated into volBrain (Manj´on and Coup´e, 2016) and more recent algorithms (Xie et al, 2023; Liu et al, 2023b). Despite the plethora of available automated brain image segmentation tools, including FreeSurfer and volBrain, it is noteworthy that these toolkits were not developed exclusively for amygdala segmentation. Recent investigations have revealed significant discrepancies in the quantitative estimates of amygdala volume when using existing software algorithms, which can affect the validity of amygdala-centric research findings (Zhou et al, 2021). That is, inaccurate segmentation can introduce systematic biases, compromising the precision and reliability of volumetric measurements. In summary, the accurate segmentation of the human amygdala poses several chal- lenges. Firstly, the amygdala constitutes merely 0.05% of the entire brain, making it susceptible to false positive segmentations. Secondly, although there are distinct class differences between the amygdala and adjacent tissue structures, these differences are minimal, only about 12.6%, compared to surrounding tissues. The complexity of neighboring structures further complicates the segmentation task due to low contrast issues (Pruessner et al, 2000; Fischl et al, 2002; Manj´on and Coup´e, 2016). In this Methods paper, we propose an innovative algorithm to take advantage of manually traced large-scale amygdalae (Zhou et al, 2021) for the transformer model (Lee et al, 2022) that emphasizes boundary delineation to address the challenges mentioned above in automated amygdala segmentation. We delineate the amygdala segmentation into three critical phases: 1) robust global localization, 2) precise delineation and 3) generalizable segmentation. In examining the structure of the amygdala, the observer must first capture the entire cerebral image and subsequently estimate the approximate position of the amygdala. This estimate relies on prior knowledge of the anatomy of the limbic system, where the amygdala is located, and considers adjacent structures such as the hippocampus. Subsequent to this initial phase, the observer leverages a meticulous understanding of the amyg- dala’s internal morphology, gray matter intensities, and other pertinent information to execute a detailed regional delineation. To enhance the segmentation process, a transformer-based algorithm is employed to discern boundary contrasts. This approach aims to improve both the robustness of global amygdala localization and the precision following key elements. 1. To achieve comprehensive detection of amygdala positioning in T1-weighted (T1w) images, we employed a transformer-based network named BOLT3D. The BOLT3D model constructs a multigranularity adaptive collaboration (MGAC) architecture, integrating a global coarse-grained perceptual module to elucidate the global semantics of the amygdala structure and enhance positional sensitivity. Given that intricate details are often neglected in global representations, a local fine-grained enhancement module was developed to augment the perception and retention of detailed information. To harmonize coarse-grained global and fine-grained local data, a multi-granular adaptive fusion module is introduced. This allows the model to concurrently consider the differences between the entire amygdala and adjacent structures, as well as the similarities within the amygdala. This design facilitates the recognition of global positioning and local disparity features, thereby improving the localization accuracy and robustness of amygdala structures. The overarch- ing design objective is to accomplish a more precise and exhaustive detection of amygdala localization contours. 2. To address the challenge of dependency on manual segmentation boundaries and enhance the congruence between predicted and actual delineations, a novel learning strategy for boundary contrasts is introduced. This method enhances the discrim- inability of limbic structures from adjacent tissues by amplifying the characteristic differences between the amygdala and its surrounding tissues, while minimizing the intra-amygdala variations. Consequently, this refines the alignment between automated boundary segmentation and manual segmentation outcomes, thereby enabling a more precise demarcation of the amygdala boundaries. 3. To ensure the generalization efficacy of BOLT3D, a Segment Anything model (SAM) is devised for the refinement of coarse predictions. Specifically, the coarse outputs of the MAGC module are sampled as point cues for the SAM model, uti- lizing the coarse segmentation as a pre-segmentation step for further refinement. Concurrently, the original SAM model is adapted to the amygdala context, compris- ing three essential components: a lightweight volumetric feature encoder, a 3D cue encoder, and a volumetric mask decoder, thereby enhancing the model’s generalized segmentation performance. Initially, we derived global and local semantic features from the original MRI image data employing a multigranularity semantic generation module as depicted in Figure 1(b). Specifically, for T1w image data I, the multigranularity semantic gen- eration module exploits the local induction capability of convolution by employing two 3D convolutions to extract the primary local features Fl. This module facilitates the computation of the interrelationships among feature points, thereby enabling the extraction of global semantic information from regions that exhibit high response in the initial position features. Subsequently, we construct the preliminary global feature Fg. Given a feature map F of dimensions d × H × W , F is derived from the input image I via a single convolutional layer and subsequently projected onto a weight map and a mapping F through two convolutional layers. The channel count on the weight map is hw (h ≤ H, w ≤ W ), where h and w represent the dimensions of the predefined global semantic map. The weight map is then flattened for the Softmax computation, and the resulting weights are used to aggregate the semantic informa- tion within the F mapping by matrix multiplication, resulting in Fg. For succinctness in the illustration, dimensions are presented in abbreviated form. The MGAC module is composed of three components: a global module for coarse- grained perception, a local module for fine-grained enhancement, and an adaptive module for multigranularity fusion, as depicted in Figure 1(c). These components interactively to enhance the model’s performance. Figure 1(b) illustrates the position- ing of the adaptive MGAC module within the overall architecture, while Figure 1(c) Each MGAC module receives two inputs, specifically global coarse-grained seman- tic characteristics Fg and local fine-grained semantic features Fl. To mitigate the tics, BatchNorm3D is used to normalize the inputs. Furthermore, the linear position projection from previous work is mapped according to the positional relationships of the elements, ensuring that the arrangement of tokens within the transformer 2021). However, this approach neglects local structural information, which is vital for image data. Although integrating positional encoding can enable the transformer to extensive training data, which poses a challenge in the realm of medical image anal- layers, thereby incorporating the inductive bias inherent to convolutions. This substi- tution facilitates the preservation of local structural information intrinsic to the image The three-dimensional depth-wise convolutionary technique is employed to con- tant features, denoted Fg and Fl, are subsequently flattened into a one-dimensional sequence to facilitate Transformer processing. Upon this transformation, Fg is con- g and a global content vector F v g . Similarly, Fl, which encapsulates detailed information, is transformed into a local index vector F k l and a local content vector F v l through analogous operations. Regarding the global coarse-grained perception module and the local fine-grained enhancement module, their internal architectures remain consistent, as illustrated in Figure 1b. These modules primarily comprise two components: a multi-head self-attention mechanism, Zl replaces the input and is initially expanded to a one- dimensional sequence. A fully connected layer then serves as the transformation layer, converting the input into a query vector, an index vector, and a content vector. Subse- quently, the multi-head attention matrix is computed by formula 1. The feedforward layer further refines the interrelationships among voxel features, while integration with the residual mechanism augments data flow. This approach proficiently preserves the original features and mitigates gradient vanishing, as detailed in formula 2. l = M HSA (LN (Zl)) + Zl, l′ = F F N (LN (Z ′ In this context, M HSA(·) denotes the multi-head self-attention mechanism, LN (·) signifies layer normalization, and F F N (·) represents the feedforward neural network. The global coarse-grained perception module and the local fine-grained enhancement module employ the computational algorithms delineated in formulas 1 and 2, respec- tively, to transform the global content vector F v g and the local content vector F v inputs. Upon completion of the processing, the resulting updated global content vector g′ and the local content vector F v F v l′ are obtained. Within the context of the adaptive multigranularity fusion module, as illustrated in Figure 1, the correlation matrix Att is derived using F q g as the query vector and F k l as the index vector. The correlation is computed by applying the formula 3, as follows: Atti,j denotes the i-th voxel characteristic within the global query vector F q the corresponding i -th voxel characteristic in the local index vector F k l . The corre- lation score between the characteristics of the j th voxel is computed accordingly. To mitigate overly concentrated correlations in specific local regions and facilitate the model optimization process, a scaling factor of 1/ dk is implemented, where dk signi- fies the dimension of an individual attention head in terms of the number of channels Upon deriving the similarity matrix Att, it is necessary to remap it into the orig- inal value space, comprising both the global content vector space F v g and the local content vector space F v l . Specifically, given the similarity matrix Att, for the local fine-grained branch F v l , Att undergoes direct propagation into a Softmax function to produce a sparse feature distribution. This distribution is then subjected to matrix multiplication with F v l , followed by convolution operations to further refine the feature distribution. This operational sequence is encapsulated in Equation 4. In contrast, for the global coarse-grained branch F v g , the matrix Att requires transposition to deter- mine the similarity score between the individual feature points and the query feature. Subsequently, matrix multiplication with F v g is performed, and the resultant prod- uct is processed through deep separable convolutions to enhance the smoothness of the feature distribution. In addition, a residual technique is employed to preserve the integrity of the information and mitigate issues of vanishing gradients. Ultimately, this module yields the outputs F sof tmax(Att)F v l sof tmax(Att⊤)F v g A vast majority of existing 3D segmentation algorithms (C¸ i¸cek et al, 2016; Chen et al, 2019; Jiang et al, 2022) typically neglect explicit segmentation of structural bound- aries. However, certain algorithms strive to improve boundary delineation through attention mechanisms (Liu et al, 2023a; Cheng et al, 2019). Despite these efforts, there remains a paucity of comprehensive and targeted research focused on evaluating the influence of boundary regions on segmentation performance, resulting in subopti- mal overall model performance. To address this gap, we propose to meticulously align boundary information from manual annotations with model segmentation outputs and introduce an innovative boundary contrast learning framework. Previous contrastive learning methodologies have been predominantly applied at the image level. For example, positional (Tang et al, 2022) extends 3D images to 2D sequences and takes advantage of positional relationships within the 2D sequence to determine spatial relationships between positive and negative samples for contrastive learning. Mask Transfiner (Ke et al, 2022) adopts contrastive learning in image patches rather than at the image level, utilizing pseudolabels to derive patches with dis- tinct semantic categories to form positive and negative sample pairs. However, these approaches are inadequate for high-resolution segmentation, since accurate amygdala segmentation requires proximity of same-type pixels throughout the 3D image, separa- tion of different-type pixels, and clustering of pixels based on their labels. Therefore, in this study, the boundary pixels are used to construct positive and negative sample pairs to maximize the distinction between the boundary pixels and adjacent nonrelevant pixels, as illustrated in Figure 1(d). Specifically, we designate the local neighborhood around the boundary as a subset, creating the boundary contrast learning strategy from overlapping 3D patch areas distributed throughout the 3D space. For each sub- set, kernels adjacent to the boundary select a 3D patch space dimension. Manually segmented amygdala data serve as a basis for constructing positive and negative sam- ples. The InfoNCE information maximization algorithm (Radford et al, 2021) is then utilized to calculate the disparity between positive and negative samples in the lati- tude space on the hypersphere. Taking into account the anatomical dimensions of the amygdala, the size of the kernel is set to 5 × 5 × 5, and each subset forms positive and negative samples within this specified area. As illustrated in Figure 1, the formula 6 is specifically designed to focus on the boundary voxels by exclusively computing them. Initially, all boundary regions Bl in manual annotations are considered, and for each voxel xi in Bl, the sampling scope for positive and negative voxels is confined to its local neighborhood Ni. Under this constraint, the positive sample xj ∈ Ni ∧ li = lj for the boundary voxel xi is identified, while the remaining neighboring voxels are treated as negative samples xj ∈ Ni ∧ li ̸= lj. In this paper, j denotes the sample voxel within the neighborhood Ni corresponding to the voxel i, with li and lj representing the categories of differ- ent voxels xi and xj, respectively. Consequently, the boundary voxel contrast learning algorithm enhances the feature discernment of structurally organized boundary voxels, thus establishing the target for contrast optimization within boundary voxels, which is crucial for enhancing the segmentation of boundary regions. Specifically, for voxels xi within boundary regions Bl, learned representations are incentivized to be more congruent with voxel features of the same category while being less congruent with features of disparate categories. Similarly, there are: exp(−d(fi, fj)/τ ) exp(−d(fi, fk)/τ ) Here, fi denotes the representation of the characteristics of xi, d(·, ·) denotes the distance function, and τ represents the temperature coefficient in contrastive learn- while the denominator reflects the similarity between positive and negative instances. Consequently, a higher intraclass similarity coupled with a lower interclass similarity results in a reduced loss. The temperature coefficient is a predefined hyperparameter that governs the model’s sensitivity to negative samples. An increased temperature coefficient τ flattens the distribution of d(fi, fj), leading to a uniform treatment of all negative samples by contrastive loss, which diminishes the model’s learning efficacy. Conversely, setting the temperature coefficient too low directs the model’s focus toward particularly challenging negative samples, which might actually be potential posi- tive samples. This hampers the model’s convergence and degrades its generalization capability. Hence, the determination of the temperature coefficient is crucial. Consistency Module with SAM We use the SAM framework to develop a consistency strategy to mitigate the discrep- ancies that arise from the scanning of different subjects. This strategy comprises three integral components: the volume feature encoder, the 3D cue encoder, and the volume mask decoder. Specifically, the principal contributions can be delineated as follows. Firstly, we introduce an SAM model tailored for the amygdala segmentation task. Unlike existing approaches to improving SAM, the novelty of our model lies in its com- prehensive consideration of factors such as the volume, shape, and relative position of the amygdala. It eschews the conventional slice-by-slice feature extraction in favor of a holistic total volume approach. This method establishes inter-slice associations, rendering it exceptionally suited for structures with intricate core regions. In contrast to traditional algorithms, this model provides a more comprehensive representation of anatomical structures, particularly for smaller entities. Secondly, the incorporation of a 3D prompt encoder ensures the preservation of prior spatial position information and the 3D spatial features provided by the user. In contrast to the 2D prompt encoder, it furnishes more precise relative position cues in a multi-dimensional space. To facilitate the effective amalgamation of the 3D cue information with the embedding features derived from the volume feature encoder, we have devised a volume mask decoder. This decoder harnesses the interaction mechanism between a prior cue embedding and the MRI embedding, facilitating seamless integration. This fusion mechanism adeptly captures nuanced details within the feature space, offering a robust tool for the precise depiction of anatomical structures. SAM constitutes an interactive segmentation methodology predicated on iterative operations, enhancing the model’s representational capacity through the incorporation of positional cues and pre-segmentation data, thereby facilitating continuous optimiza- tion of segmentation accuracy via multiple interactive iterations. In particular, when existing SAM models are applied directly to medical imaging tasks, specifically the amygdala segmentation task, their accuracy is suboptimal. To address this issue, we have meticulously tailored the design of the 2D SAM model for the amygdala seg- mentation context and introduced an advanced SAM model, which comprises three integral encoders for the volume feature, the 3D cue and the volume mask. The function of the Volume Feature Encoder is to transform the input T1w struc- tural image into an MRI embedding vector. Compared to the 2D encoder in the traditional SAM, it allows simultaneous consideration of volume, shape, and relative position, thus offering a more comprehensive representation of anatomical structures and enhancing the processing of complex structures around the core area. To incor- porate interactive cues and existing amygdala segmentation results, a 3D cue encoder is used to encode this prior information. The 3D cue encoder comprises two com- ponents: the click-cue branch and the pre-segmentation cue branch. The click-cue branch converts user-provided cue points into learnable location embedding features to more precisely delineate the location of the amygdala. The pre-segmentation prompt encoder uses the last click of the model during interactive segmentation as input or feeds the pre-segmentation result into the model, thereby prompting the model to adjust and optimize the current segmentation result. To effectively integrate the cue encoder’s information with the feature embedding produced by the feature encoder, and to retrieve and refine the information pertaining to the amygdala, we devise a vol- ume mask detector to ensure the seamless alignment between cue feature information and the original feature encoder output. As the pivotal component, the volume mask decoder is principally designed to exhaustively explore key characteristics within the amygdala, thereby enhancing the model’s efficacy in intricate medical contexts. Its fundamental function is to amalga- mate the MRI embedding vector resulting from the volume feature encoder with the user-provided prompt inputs to ascertain the correlation between them, culminating in precise predictive results. The 3D mask decoder emits MRI embedding and cue embedding through a multi-layered fusion 3D feature encoder, facilitating multi-level and multi-perspective information extraction. This comprehensive fusion mechanism enables the model to assimilate MRI images more profoundly and improves the dis- cernment of medical structures, thus increasing predictive precision. In conclusion, the decoder produces precise predictions of specific structures or lesions within medical images, offering crucial support for clinicians to make accurate diagnoses and devise treatment strategies. We implement an advanced deep-supervised strategy for the formulation of the loss function. Specifically, this involves the integration of supervisory signals in each inter- mediate module and the terminal module, thereby facilitating enhanced gradient propagation and optimizing the efficiency of network training. For each supervisory signal, we incorporate two distinct loss functions, namely, the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss and the Dice loss. The overall loss function is constructed as follows. To address the issue of imbalance between positive (amygdala) and negative (other tissue) samples in the loss of BCE, an adapted version is employed. For simplicity, the l=0(gi,j = l)logP r(pi,j = l|Ψ) W where l ∈ (0, 1) denotes two categories of labels. The variables pi,j and gi,j represent the predicted and ground truth values, respectively, at the spatial coordinate (i, j) within a CT image characterized by a width of W and a height of H. The symbol Ψ encompasses all parameters of the model and P r(pi,j = l) signifies the predicted probability. The term αi,j ∈ [0, 1] stands for the pixel-specific weight. We define α as where Ai,j denotes the region adjacent to the pixel (i, j), and | · | signifies the calculation of the absolute value. Moreover, the Dice loss is defined as Our algorithm was implemented utilizing the PyTorch framework and utilizes the full capabilities of the Tesla A10 GPU to optimize computational efficiency. AdamW opti- mizer (Xu et al, 2022), a common choice within the transformer architecture domain, was used for routine updates of network parameters. The learning rate was meticu- lously set to 1e − 4 and the weight decay was equally adjusted to 1e − 4 to achieve an equilibrium between the stability of the training and the convergence speed of the model. To mitigate memory consumption, a batch size of 1 was designated, and the training process encompassed 100 iterations. This configuration ensures that the model undergoes sufficient training cycles to attain optimal performance and effectively dis- cern feature representations. During the testing phase, the input image dimensions were reduced to 48 × 64 × 80 to minimize computational demands. Subsequently, no post-processing optimization techniques were employed, thereby ensuring an objective assessment of model performance. In this study, neuroimaging data of human brain scans from three cohorts, includ- ing the Chongqing cohort of the Chinese Color Nest Cohort (CKG-CCNC) (Fan et al, 2023; Liu et al, 2021; Yang et al, 2017), the Beijing Normal University Childhood (Sun et al, 2022) and the Zhejiang University Mul- ticenter Traveler Cohort (ZJU-MTC) (Tong et al, 2020), were used. CKG-CCNC is part of the development component of CCNP (devCCNP), which was collected at Southwest University in Chongqing, China. The devCCNP aims to map normative brain development trajectories within the Chinese population during school years. The devCCNP-CKG dataset included data from 201 participants aged 6-17 years, who were invited to participate in three consecutive waves of data collection at intervals of approximately 1.25 years. At these time points, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1w) was performed and images were visually inspected to exclude those with significant head movement artifacts and structural abnormalities. After this ini- tial quality control, the final sample included 427 scans from 198 participants (105 girls and 93 boys). The distribution of participants with one, two and three scans was 48, 71, and 79, respectively, with an average of 2.16 scans per participant. BNU-CAC aims to investigate the impact of childhood adversity on brain development. It consists of 116 subjects (60 girls and 56 boys) aged 8-13 years who have been scanned once per individual and passed quality control protocols. ZJU-MTC includes three adult travelers (Tong et al, 2020) to evaluate image consistency between centers under iden- tical parameters with data collection performed across 10 scanning centers, ensuring comprehensive inter-center comparability. To rigorously assess the model’s performance, standard evaluation metrics for med- ical image segmentation have been incorporated, primarily encompassing similarity metrics and distance-based metrics. These include the Dice coefficient (Milletari et al, 2016) and the Jaccard coefficient (JS), the average surface distance (ASD) and the average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) (Berhane et al, 2020), and the relative volume difference (RVD) (Wang et al, 2008). In addition, precision and recall metrics derived from the confusion matrix are also utilized (Borji et al, 2015). Details of these Dice similarity coefficient (Dice) is used to measure the similarity between 2|VSeg ∩ VGT| |VSeg| + |VGT| where VSeg and VGT represent the voxel sets of the segmentation and GT, respectively. | · | denotes the operation of cardinality computation, which provides the number of elements in a set. Intersection over Union (IoU) is the area of intersection between the predicted segments and the labels divided by the area of union between the predicted segments and the labels. |VSeg ∩ VGT| |VSeg ∪ VGT| Average Surface Distance (ASSD) is a metric based on the surface distance defined as the average distance between the surface voxel S(VSeg) of the segmentation |S(VSeg)| + |S(VGT)| d sVSeg, S(VGT) + d (sVGT , S(VSeg)) where d(s, S(X)) is defined as the minimum Euclidean distance from the voxel s to the surface voxel of the volume X. Relative Volume Difference (RVD) is used to measure the difference between predicted lung infections and GT. We take the absolute value of RVD and report the corresponding results in this work. |VSeg| − |VGT| |VGT| Asymmetry index (AI) assesses the degree of lateralization of the left and right amygdala and is defined as Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) reflects the consistency of results across multiple centers and is defined as (M SB − M SW ) M SB + (k − 1) ∗ M SW M SB denotes the mean square between groups, M SW denotes the mean square within groups, and k is the number of raters. BOLT3D demonstrates unequivocal superiority within the test cohort, attaining exem- plary performance in critical metrics including Dice, JS and HD95 relative to other prevalent algorithms. A comprehensive analysis of these individual metrics and the pronounced performance benefits conferred by BOLT3D on various parameters is presented in Table 1. The Dice coefficient and the JS coefficient serve as imperative metrics for evaluating the extent of overlap in segmentation outcomes. BOLT3D achieves a Dice coefficient of (0.787), and ResU-Net3D (0.841). Analogously, the JS coefficient demonstrates a com- superior segmentation precision. The HD95 and the ASSD quantify the spatial discrep- highlighting the interval between the segmented boundary of the amygdala and the of 1.097 relative to other algorithms such as U-Net3D (1.565), U-Net3D++ (1.963), and ResU-Net3D (1.669). This shows that BOLT3D excels in preserving spatial con- and recall metrics are used to assess false positives. The precision metric quantifies the Table 1: Amygdala index results of 347 scans in the CKG-CCNC cohort proportion of true positive instances among those designated as positive by the model, whereas the recall metric evaluates the proportion of true positive instances correctly identified by the model from all positive instances in the dataset. BOLT3D’s precision and recall are 0.883 and 0.929, respectively, surpassing the performance of other algo- rithms. BOLT3D manifests an admirable balance between these metrics, resulting in an overall superior performance relative to other algorithms. Additionally, BOLT3D achieves a relative RVD of 0.056, significantly lower than that of other algorithms, thereby highlighting the algorithm’s exceptional accuracy in volume prediction. Figure 2 elucidates the comparative segmentation outcomes across multiple algo- rithms on a representative subject, illustrating the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with respect to volumetric and boundary concordance with man- Freesurfer deviates markedly from both the morphological and manual segmentation results. The presence of numerous spaces indicates an inability to accurately capture the structural integrity of the actual amygdala. A closer inspection of its periph- eries reveals that the Freesurfer exhibits numerous irregularities when juxtaposed with the gold standard. The amygdala delineated by Unet exhibits morphological char- acteristics comparable to those of the gold standard. However, an assessment of the superposition effect and edge segmentation results reveals that the volumetric delin- eation by Unet is substantially overestimated. In contrast, our BOLT3D results exhibit a morphological resemblance closer to the gold standard. The superposition effect in BOLT3D is similarly congruent with the gold standard, demonstrating no signifi- cant volumetric overestimation or underestimation, which is corroborated by the edge segmentation results. The superiority of BOLT3D is primarily attributable to the integration of Transformer technology with a boundary contrast learning algorithm, thus improving its ability to capture intricate structural details in the image while\n",
