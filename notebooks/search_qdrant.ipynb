       "    'main_text': \"Dorso-ventral hippocampal neural assemblies are preferentially reactivated during NREM sleep following an aversive experience 1Institut du Fer à Moulin, Inserm U1270, Sorbonne Université, Paris *corresponding author: gabrielle.girardeau@inserm.fr Sleep plays a crucial role in memory stabilization. In the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), fast oscillations (sharp-wave   ripples)   during   non-REM   sleep   consolidate   spatial   memories   through   place   cell reactivation. The hippocampal formation is heterogeneous; the dHPC processes mostly contextual information, while the ventral part (vHPC) encodes valence and anxiety. We propose that dorsal- ventral communication during sleep is involved in the consolidation of emotional memories, potentially integrating   or   segregating   contextual   and   valence   information.   To   test   this,   we   recorded   the electrophysiological  activity  in  the  dHPC  and  vHPC  in  rats  during  reward  and  aversion-motivated exploration of a linear track and subsequent sleep. We detected dorsal and ventral SWRs during NREM   sleep   as   well   as   neuronal   assemblies   during   each   exploration   type   and   identified   dorsal, ventral, and joint (dorso-ventral) assemblies. We found that dorso-ventral hippocampal coordination involves   coordinated   ripples   and   bursts   of   ripples.   Aversive   joint   assemblies   exhibited   higher reactivation during non-REM sleep than the joint assemblies from the reward condition. Interestingly, joint   aversive   assemblies   reactivated   selectively   during   dorso-ventral   coordinated   ripples. Furthermore, their reactivation strength positively correlated with their strength of activation during the task.  These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence. Episodic  memory is supported by the hippocampus,  a  heterogeneous brain structure with distinct functional   and   anatomical   properties   along   its   dorsoventral   axis  (Fanselow   and   Dong   2010; Bannerman   et   al.   2004;   Strange   et   al.   2014).   The   dorsal   hippocampus   (dHPC)   encodes   spatial representations of the environment through the activity of place cells, which code for specific locations called place fields  (O’Keefe 1976; M. a Wilson and McNaughton 1993). During NREM sleep (slow- wave   sleep),   these   spatial   representations   are   reactivated  (M.   A.   Wilson   and   McNaughton   1994; Skaggs and McNaughton 1996), preferentially during fast oscillatory hippocampal events known as “sharp-wave ripples” (SWRs) (Buzsáki 2015). Dorsal SWRs support spatial (Gabrielle Girardeau et al. 2009; Ego-Stengel and Wilson 2009) and contextual fear (Wang et al. 2015) memory consolidation. Interestingly,   dHPC   spatial   representations   can   be   modulated   by   the   emotional   valence   of   the environment, notably through remapping (Moita et al. 2004; D. V. Wang et al. 2015; Schuette et al. 2020; Hollup et al. 2001; Dupret et al. 2010). Moreover, dHPC sleep reactivations after an aversive experience   can   occur   conjointly   with   the   basolateral   amygdala   (BLA)  (G.   Girardeau,   Inema,   and Buzsáki 2017), which is involved in fear processing, and other emotion-processing structures (Lansink et al. 2008; 2009; Pennartz et al. 2009). However, the  dHPC has no direct anatomical connections with the BLA and only marginal ones with the rest of the emotional network, including the mPFC, nucleus Accumbens and VTA (Malik et al. 2022; Harvey et al. 2023). Compared to the dHPC, the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is understudied, particularly regarding its role in memory consolidation during sleep  (Pronier, n.d.). The vHPC displays poorer spatial coding properties than the dHPC (Jung, Wiener, and McNaughton 1994; Kjelstrup et al. 2008), but plays a stronger role in emotional processing, particularly in anxiety-like behaviors (Forro et al. 2022; Jimenez et  al.  2018;  Ciocchi  et  al.  2015)  and  fear  processing  (Jimenez  et   al.  2020;  Herbst,   Twining,  and Gilmartin 2022). Unlike the dHPC, the vHPC has reciprocal anatomical connections with the emotion- processing   network,   such   as   the   BLA  (Pitkänen   et   al.   2000;   Binder   et   al.   2019).   The   vHPC   is necessary for contextual fear memory consolidation during sleep, notably through its connections with the BLA (Huff et al. 2016; G.-W. Wang, Liu, and Wang 2017). Therefore, the vHPC could serve as a relay structure to integrate the contextual and spatial information being reactivated in the dHPC with the   emotional   valence   processed   in   the   vHPC   and   BLA.   To   date,   only   one   study   has   reported reactivations   implicating   the   vHPC   following   fear   conditioning  (Miyawaki   and   Mizuseki   2022), conjointly with the BLA, associated with SWR events. SWRs propagate along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus, and marginal coordination of those events between dorsal and ventral parts has been reported during sleep without prior learning or emotional experience (Patel et al. 2013). We hypothesize that changes in the coordination of dorsal and   ventral   hippocampal   ripples   could   foster   the   reactivation   of   joint   dorso-ventral   neuronal assemblies encoding the spatial and emotional components of an experience. To study the respective and   conjoint   roles   of   the   dHPC   and   the   vHPC   in   the   sleep-dependent   processing   of   emotionally valenced experiences, we recorded neuronal activity in both regions simultaneously in rats performing a new task specifically designed to elicit the same behavior in the same spatial environments, but with opposing valences. These rats were subjected to aversive or reward-motivated exploration on a linear track, preceded and followed by sleep periods. We identified dorsal, ventral, and dorsoventral joint cell assemblies in the hippocampus that represented the aversive and reward conditions of the task. We then investigated whether those assemblies were reactivated during subsequent NREM sleep, the extent   to   which   they   coincide   with   the   dorsoventral   coordination   of   SWRs,   and   how   these   were influenced by emotional valence. Rats   can   perform   the   same   exploratory   behavior   motivated   by   either   reward   or avoidance. To   study   dorsal-ventral   hippocampal   joint   reactivations,   we   developed   a   behavioral   task   where animals   have   to   perform   the   same   exploratory   behavior   on   a   linear   track   but   under   different motivational   contingencies   associated   with   opposite   valences.   In   the   reward-motivated,   positive contingency, the rats have to run back and forth on the linear track to obtain a drop of water at the end of each lap (Rewarded Run). The avoidance-motivated, aversive contingency was conducted on the same linear track and signaled by a single, constant light cue. During this session, animals were running back and forth to avoid an eyelid shock (Aversive Run) delivered after 20-30 seconds of immobility.   (Figure   1A-B).   During   pre-training,   the   animals   very   rapidly   learned   to   alternate   for rewards,   but   the   shock   condition   had   to   be   gradually   introduced   to   preserve   the   mobility   and alternation behavior (Figure S1A). The experiments started at plateau performance for the number of shocks. The beginning of the plateau performance was defined as a drop in the number of shocks by at least 50% (Figure 1B, lower panel, session 0).  The number of rewarded laps, but also the number of aversive laps and shocks remained stable across all subsequent recording sessions (Figure 1B, upper and middle panels). Each day, animals performed both the reward and aversive version of the task, preceded and followed by 2 to 3 hours of rest in their homecage. The order of the reward and aversive  runs  was  switched  every  day.  Despite  a  decrease  in  global  speed  during  aversive  runs compared to reward ones (Figure S1C), animals explore homogeneously the linear track in both, aversive   and   rewarded   runs   (Figure   S1B)   and   the   speed   distribution   patterns   across   space   are similar (Figure S2A). To pair the behavior across conditions, we selected moments in which animals were either active or quiet. We did not find significant differences in occupancy in either of these states across space (Figure S2B-C) or in total time between conditions (Figure S2C). Dorsal-ventral coordinated ripples occur in bursts. We   recorded   local   field   potentials   and   neuronal   ensembles   from   the   dorsal   and   ventral   CA1 hippocampal regions (Figure S3) in a total of 47 sessions (5 rats with simultaneous dHPC and vHPC recordings;   1   rat   vHPC).   Each   unit   was   categorized   as   putative   pyramidal   cells   (Pyr)   or   putative interneurons (Int) (see Methods). We identified a total of 1,615 units in both structures.  A total of 544 units were from the vHPC (pyr: 461; int: 83) and 1071 from the dHPC (pyr: 856; int: 215). The firing rate was higher in putative interneurons compared to putative pyramidal cells within both regions (Figure S4). Putative pyramidal cells in the dHPC exhibited a higher burst index, consistent with the existing literature (Connor & Gutnick, 1990). Sharp-wave ripple complexes (SWRs) in the dHPC and vHPC were detected by thresholding the normalized square root of the filtered local-field potential (Figure 2A, B). We found that dorsal ripple rates were significantly higher than ventral ones (Figure 2C). Dorsal ripple rate, but not ventral ripple rate increased during sleep following either the rewarded or the aversive session, compared to baseline sleep (Figure S6A). Moreover, we did not observe changes   in   the   autocorrelograms   of   dorsal   or   ventral   ripples,   even   when   separated   by   emotional Dorsal and ventral ripples were shown to be partially coordinated  (Patel et al. 2013)  during NREM sleep, but   it  is yet unknown how spatial  exploration or an emotional experience might affect this coordination during subsequent sleep. On the cross-correlation between dorsal and ventral ripples, the central peak was shifted to positive time bins, suggesting that ventral ripples tend to occur after dorsal ones (Figure 2D). The existence of 2 additional peaks within a +-100ms window suggests that dorso-ventral coordination occurs through bursts of ripples. Based on this temporal coordination, we defined coordinated events as events during which a dorsal ripple occurred within 100 ms of a ventral one. Both dorsal and ventral ripples showed a percentage of coordinated events significantly higher than   chance   (Figure   2E).   The   proportion   of   coordinated   events   was   not   increased   after   either valenced exploration compared to baseline (Figure S6D). The amplitude of coordinated dorsal and ventral ripples was higher than the amplitude of  uncoordinated ripples (Figure  S6E), as  reported previously (Patel et al. 2013).  This did not affect the recruitment of single units by dorsal or ventral ripples, which does not differ between coordinated and uncoordinated ripples (Figure S6F). Finally, we found that in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus, coordinated ripples tend to occur in bursts compared   to   uncoordinated   ripples,   as   indicated   by   the   different   peaks   on   the   coordinated   x uncoordinated cross-correlagrams and the burst index (Figure 2F,G). Dorsal bursts occur preferentially before ventral ones. We aimed to explore whether communication between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus could be mediated by coordinated ripple bursts, and if so, whether one region may lead to the coordination. Using cross-correlations between coordinated and uncoordinated ripples in the dorsal and ventral HPC,   we   found   that   in   the   dorsal   hippocampus,   uncoordinated   events   tend   to   occur   before coordinated ones, whereas in the ventral hippocampus,  this tendency was reversed (Figure  2H). These results suggest that dorsal-ventral coordination might occur at the end of a dorsal burst and the beginning of a ventral burst. To test this hypothesis, we detected ripple bursts in both regions by identifying sequences of ripples occurring within less than 100 milliseconds of each other (Figure S7A). We found that burst durations were not different between structures (Figure S7B), showing a temporal dorsal-ventral overlap of ≈100 ms (Figure S7C). Next, we aimed to determine if one of the two   structures   was   leading   the   burst   coordination.   We   first   constructed   a   histogram   of   the   time differences between the end of dorsal ripple bursts and the beginning of ventral ones. We observed a probability peak between 0-500 ms, suggesting that dorsal ripples tend to end after ventral ones have started (Figure 2I). Additionally, we constructed a peri-event histogram of the starting times of dorsal bursts aligned to the end of ventral bursts. Consistent with our previous analysis, we found that dorsal ripple bursts tend to start before the end of ventral ones (Figure 2J). Experience also modulates ripple burstiness, with both aversive and rewarded conditions leading to an increase in the proportion of ripples occurring in bursts in the dorsal, but not the ventral hippocampus (Figure S7D). Overall, these results show that dorso-ventral coordination occurs at the level of single ripples but also ripple bursts, with the dorsal hippocampus leading the ventral hippocampus. Experience might modulate coordination at both these scales. Dorsal-ventral   joint   assemblies   better   disambiguate   the   reward   and   aversive conditions Next, we examined the changes in dorso-ventral coordination at the level of neuronal assemblies. Neuronal assemblies were detected using a PCA-ICA method (Lopes-dos-Santos, Ribeiro, and Tort 2013)(Figure S8) either during the aversive or the rewarded condition on all simultaneously recorded pyramidal neurons in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. The detection was restricted to moments of behavioral activity (Figure S2C). For each of the 446 detected assemblies, we applied a threshold to the ICA weight vectors to determine the neurons that were significantly contributing to the assembly (Figure 3A). We differentiated 277  assemblies with only dorsal hippocampus contributing members (131   aversive   and   146   rewarded),   62   assemblies   with   only   ventral   hippocampus   members   (37 aversive and 25 rewarded), and 107 assemblies with contributing members from both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. We called these joint assemblies (54 aversive and 53 rewarded). We did not detect   differences   in   the   number   (Figure   S9A)   or   proportions   (Figure   S9B)   of   members   across assembly types (dorsal, ventral, or joint). Assemblies were separately detected on the same set of neurons   during   either   the   aversive   or   the   reward   conditions.   Comparing   the   overlap   between assemblies detected in the aversive vs. the reward condition is indicative of the difference in the neural representation of similar environments with different contextual valences. We computed the similarity   index   across   pairs   of   dorsal,   ventral,   or   joint   assemblies   detected   in   different   valence conditions   and   detected   significantly   similar   pairs   (Figure   3B).   Joint   assemblies   showed   less overlapping   between   the   aversive   and   rewarded   conditions   compared   to   the   other   two   types   of assemblies (Figure 3C). This result suggests that the contextual valence is better disambiguated by representations involving both the dorsal and ventral neurons. Aversive joint assemblies reactivate more during the following NREM sleep than joint reward assemblies During sleep after an experience, neuronal assemblies formed and activated during the exploration show an increased reactivation pattern in the dorsal hippocampus  (M. A. Wilson and McNaughton 1994; van de Ven et al. 2016) and also between the dorsal hippocampus and basolateral amygdala (G. Girardeau, Inema, and Buzsáki 2017).  However, it remains unclear if those patterns of assembly reactivation   occur   along   the   dorsal-ventral   hippocampal   axis   and   if   a   potential   modulation   exists based on the emotional valence of the awake experience. To address this, we calculated the strength of activation for each joint assembly detected during the aversive or reward experience during the rest of the recording session, including REM and NREM sleep in the homecage (Figure 3D). Then we calculated the rate of peaks of activation (see Methods) in 60-second bins during NREM sleep before and   after   the   rewarded   or   aversive   exploration   (Figure   4A).   Both   aversive   and   reward   joint assemblies exhibited higher activation rates during post-sleep compared to pre-sleep periods. This difference diminishes over the course of the sleep session (0-20 minutes vs 20-40 minutes of NREM sleep;  Figure 4B), consistent with previous observations that reactivations rapidly decline over the first hour of NREM sleep (G. Girardeau, Inema, and Buzsáki 2017; Miyawaki and Mizuseki 2022). The same result was observed for dorsal and ventral assemblies (Figure S10). Interestingly, the activation rates of the joint assemblies during sleep following the aversive experience were also significantly higher than  following the rewarded experience (0-20min: pKS=9,97x10-6;  20-40min: pKS=0.83). This increased reactivation after the aversive cognition was not observed for dorsal or ventral assemblies only. To confirm this observation, we computed the peak reactivation strength (see Methods), which reflects the magnitude of the detected peaks during post-sleep controlled for the magnitude observed during   pre-sleep.   Again,   we   observed   a   significantly   higher   reactivation   for   the   joint   aversive assemblies compared to the reward joint assemblies (Figure 4C). Then we wanted to test whether this   increased   reactivation   was   initiated   during   the   exploration   of   the   track.   We   found   that   the reactivation strength positively correlated with the strength of the assemblies during the exploration of the aversive, but not the rewarded condition (Figure 4C-D). This correlation was selective for joint aversive assemblies, and not present for either joint reward assemblies or dHPC/vHPC assemblies in either condition (Figure S11). No differences in activation rates nor reactivation strength were found for   any   of   the   assembly   types   during   REM   sleep   (Figure   S12  ).   These   results   indicate   that   the exploration of a given environment under aversive conditions selectively recruits assemblies spanning both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus that will be later reactivated during sleep. The   reactivation   strength   of   joint   aversive   assemblies   is   increased   during   dorsal- ventral coordinated ripples. Assembly pattern reactivations have consistently been found to co-occur with ripple oscillations (Diba and   Buzsáki   2007;   Foster   and   Wilson   2006),   and   later   on   in   ripple   burst   events  (Davidson, Kloosterman, and Wilson 2009). Since ripple oscillations have been shown to synchronize the activity of long-distance structures, they might represent a time window instrumental for the hippocampus to transfer information coded during wakefulness. We thus tested whether the observed reactivations of the joint assemblies were specifically occurring during coordinated ripple events. We calculated the Peak Reactivation Strength, during dorsal-ventral coordinated and uncoordinated ripple events. We found   that   only   joint   aversive,   but   not   reward,   assemblies   showed   a   significant   increase   in   peak reactivation strength during dorsal-ventral coordinated  events (Figure 5,  left).  This result was not observed   for   dorsal   or   ventral   aversive   assemblies   (Figure   S13A).   Although   there   was   a   slight increase in joint aversive assembly reactivation during uncoordinated ventral ripples, the increase in Peak   Reactivation   Strength   for   joint   aversive   assemblies   was   mostly   selective   for   dorsal-ventral coordinated ripples (Figure 5, middle, right). Dorsal or ventral assemblies did not show any increase relative to uncoordinated or coordinated ripples (Figure S13B-C). These results indicate that dorso- ventral   coordinated   ripples   constitute   a   permissive   time   window   for   the   reinstatement   of   the representation   of   an   aversive   environment   by   the   joint   neural   activity   of   the   dorsal   and   ventral hippocampus. This study examined dorsal-ventral hippocampal coordination at both population and single-unit levels during awake experiences of reward and aversive spatial navigation, as well as during subsequent sleep processing. We found that temporally coordinated dorsal and ventral ripples tended to occur in bursts,   with   dorsal   ripples   leading   ventral   ripples.   We   identified   dorsal   and   ventral   hippocampal assemblies as well as dorsoventral joint assemblies during both types of emotional experiences, with joint   assemblies   showing   less   similarity   overlap   between   emotional   conditions.   Reactivation   of assemblies during NREM sleep was observed for all assembly types, with higher intensity for joint aversive assemblies, particularly during coordinated dorsal and ventral ripples. Ripple occurrences in the dorsal hippocampus have been previously shown to be up-modulated by previous exposition to a learning task (O’Neill et al. 2010). Similarly, we found that both aversive and rewarded run sessions trigger the increase of ripple rate compared to baseline sleep in the dorsal hippocampus   (Figure   S6A).   However,   in   the   ventral   hippocampus,   we   found   that   neither   the rewarded nor aversive experience triggered an increase in ripple rate during subsequent NREM sleep compared to baseline. In addition to rate changes, the aversive or rewarded experiences also trigger an increase in burstiness, i.e. the tendency for ripples to occur in groups of 2 or more, in the dHPC, but not in the vHPC. Bursts of SWRs in the dHPC have been previously reported to promote extended replay sequences of experiences in large environments (Davidson, Kloosterman, and Wilson 2009). This suggests that the synchronized activity between dHPC and vHPC for the processing of complex contextual-emotional experiences could be facilitated by coordinated bursts of SWRs. A subset of ripples are coordinated across the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus in baseline conditions (Patel et al. 2013). Here, we show that this coordination also exists during sleep following spatial navigation under different valences. Indeed, a subset of ripples are coordinated, thanks to an overlap in bursts of ripples initiated in the dorsal hippocampus and finishing in the vHPC. Previously published studies on cross-structure reactivations similarly showed that the dHPC tends to lead the reactivations (Lansink et al. 2008; 2009; Pennartz et al. 2009). This sequential activation may reflect a process where spatial information from the dHPC is processed first, followed by emotional and   contextual   information   from   the   vHPC.     Surprisingly,   and   despite   an   increase   in   rate   and burstiness in the dHPC, neither an aversive nor positive experience triggers a change in dorso-ventral ripple coordination (Figure S2D). This suggests the existence of more subtle modifications at the level of neuronal assemblies. Cell assemblies with synchronously active neurons from both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus neurons were shown to develop during the exposition to contextual fear conditioning (Pompili, Hamou, and   Wiener   2024).   Here,   we   detected   dorsal,   ventral,   and   dorso-ventral   joint   assemblies   during aversive-motivated and rewarded-motivated exploration using the same set of neurons (Figure 3A- B). When examining the overlap between the different types of assemblies between the reward and aversive   conditions,   we   found   that   the   joint   assemblies   were   the   most   different   between   the   two valence conditions (Figure 3C). This suggests that synchronous neuronal activation spanning both dHPC and vHPC provides finer contextual-emotional neural representations, potentially facilitating the discrimination between two differentially valenced experiences. Multiple   studies   already   reported   reactivations   implicating   the   dHPC    (G.   Girardeau,   Inema,   and Buzsáki 2017; Lansink et al. 2008; 2009; Pennartz et al. 2009)  or vHPC  (Miyawaki and Mizuseki 2022)  in coordination with valence-related structures during sleep. Here we show that dorso-ventral joint neuronal assemblies formed during an aversive exploratory behavior are selectively reactivated during the following NREM sleep epoch. These reactivations do not occur for purely ventral or dorsal assemblies following any of the two valence conditions. Why did only the joint aversive assemblies show   an   increase   in   reactivation   strength?   One   possible   explanation   is   that,   since   the   spatial information between the two emotional run sessions is the same, the valence gains influence their differentiation.   Given   the   smaller   overlap   between   condition   representations   in   joint   assemblies compared to dorsal and ventral assemblies (Figure 3A-B), joint assemblies might be preferentially reactivated to promote the discrimination between two differentially valenced experiences. Since the vHPC has been mostly linked to the negative side of the valence spectrum (fear, anxiety, stress; Ghasemi et al. 2022), the joint assemblies might be biased towards processing aversive-valenced environments compared to reward-valenced environments during sleep. The   decay   of   reactivations   along   post-sleep   time   was   not   affected   by   the   type   of   assemblies   or condition   valence   of   the   preceding   exploration   (Figure   4B;   Figure   S10).   All   assemblies   tend   to reactivate   during   the   first   20   minutes   of   post-sleep   and   then   gradually   decrease   in   activity. Interestingly, this window of time for joint reactivations was previously reported in studies implicating the vHPC  (Miyawaki and Mizuseki 2022)  and the dHPC  (G. Girardeau, Inema, and Buzsáki 2017). Reactivations in the dHPC and vHPC were shown to preferentially occur during respectively, dorsal SWR and ventral SWR. Here, we found that joint dorsoventral aversive assemblies reactivate after aversive experiences (Figure 4), and so selectively during dorsoventral coordinated SWRs (Figure In summary, we detected joint dorsoventral cell assemblies in the hippocampus that are reactivated strongly during NREM sleep following aversive-motivated exploration, and to a lesser extent following rewarded-motivated exploration. Compared to dorsal or ventral assemblies, joint assemblies showed minor activity overlapping between the two emotional conditions suggesting that they might facilitate the discrimination between two differentially-valenced environments. Joint assemblies reactivations were   stronger   during   dorsoventral   coordinated   SWRs   after   aversive   and   not   after   the   reward condition. Coordinated dorsoventral events are composed of bursts of SWRs and the proportion of SWRs occurring in bursts increases particularly following aversive-condition. These findings suggest that SWRs bursts and their dorsoventral coordination provide a physiological mechanism to integrate context-emotion representations spanning dHPC and vHPC during sleep. We hypothesize that joint reactivations of dHPC and vHPC during dorsoventral coordinated SWRs bursts are responsible for sleep-dependent emotional processing. This is influenced by the preceding emotional valence, with a stronger processing for aversive experiences than rewarded experiences. Further experiments are required to deepen this hypothesis, such as using behavioral tasks that involve reward- or aversive- driven learning to correlate dorsoventral sleep coordination with memory performance, or dynamically perturbate this coordination to investigate its implication in emotional memory consolidation.

All   experimental   procedures   were   performed   following   the   official   European guidelines   for   the   care   and   use   of   laboratory   animals   (86/609/EEC),   the   Policies   of   the   French Committee of Ethics (Decrees n° 87-848 and n° 2001–464), and after approval by ethical committee Subjects and electrode implantation. This project included six individually housed female Long- Evans (Rats id: 103, 126, 127, 128, 132, 165) and maintained on a 12h:12h light-dark cycle during experiments. For the surgery animals (300g 3 months old at the time of the surgery) were injected with buprenorphine (Vetergesic® - 0.3mg/ml, dose: 0.05mg/kg) before anesthesia induction. For the whole surgery time animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane.  Following the loss of reflex we subcutaneously injected the local anesthetic Lidocaine (Lidor®- 20mg/mL, dose: 4mg/kg)on the scalp, after 15 minutes of the Lidocaíne injection an incision was performed to open access to the skull. Corporal temperature was monitored throughout the surgery and maintained at 37°C using a heating pad. Small metal screws were placed at different points in the skull as anchors for the implant. Two or three   electrodes   mounted   on   individual   movable   nano-drives   (Cambridge   nano-drives, size(2x5x11mm)) were implanted above the vHPC unilaterally (initial position, AP: -5.50mm, LAT: 4.10mm, DV: -6.5mm, angle: 10°) and in the dHPC either unilaterally or bilaterally (initial position, AP: -3.50mm, LAT: 2.50mm, DV: -1.7mm). Dental cement was used to anchor the microdrives. To target the vHPC we used an 8-shank silicon probe (NeuroNexus Buzsaki64L), while for the dHPC we used either   a   4-shank   silicon   probe   (NeuroNexus   Buzsaki32)   or   a   customized   array   constituted   of   8 tetrodes   (20   μm   insulated   tungsten   wire)   arranged   in   a   straight   line.   Two   screws   located   on   the occipital   bone   were   used   as   ground   and   reference.   The   drives   and   probes   were   protected   by   a cement-covered   copper-mesh   Faraday   cage   on   which   the   probe   connectors   were   attached.   We implanted a bipolar electrode in the eyelid to administer electric shocks during aversive runs. This involved introducing two 140 μm silver wires between the skin and the muscle surrounding the eyelid. The external tips of the wires were then soldered to connectors fixed to the copper mesh.  During the two   first   days   following   the   surgery,   animals   were   injected   with   a   combination   of   Buprenorphine (Vetergesic® - 0.3mg/ml, dose: 0.05mg/kg), and Meloxicam (Metacam®- 5mg/mL, dose: 1mg/kg). Animals were allowed to recover for at least 5 days with ad libitum food and water. In Rat 126, the dHPC probe failed reaching to the pyramidal layer during the experiment. Thus, only vHPC data was used from this animal. Recordings and Behavior. All animals were free from prior manipulation before being included in the study. After at least 5 days of daily handling, animals were water-deprived and trained to run back and forth on a linear track for water rewards. All experiments were performed during the light cycle. After 7 days of training, animals regained access to ad libitum water and were exposed to the electrode implantation surgery 3 days later. After the recovery period, animals were water-deprived again and re-exposed to the rewarded linear track task for at least 2 days. Subsequently, animals were exposed to   three   daily   training   sessions   composed   of   a   rewarded   and   an   aversive-motivated   linear   track exploration. Before and after each run condition, animals were allowed to sleep for at least 2 hours. During  aversive run sessions, animals were provided water at the end of each lap for a specific period, while the remainder of the time, they received an electric shock to the eyelid if they remained motionless for at least 20 seconds. The reward time was progressively reduced during aversive runs across training days until only shocks were delivered if the animal remained quiet. Task sessions were composed of pure reward and pure aversive run sessions, preceded and followed by sleep sessions (Figure 1A-B). At the end of each recording day, animals were reintroduced to ad libitum water for 5 to 20 minutes to ensure the animals remained>80% of their normal weight. The probes were   slowly   lowered   in   the   brain   to   reach   dorsal   and   ventral   pyramidal   layers   after   finishing   the training   sessions.   Probes   were   adjusted   daily   to   optimize   ripple   and   unit   recording.   We   tried   to maximize the chances of getting usable data once the animal reached a plateau performance in the aversive   condition.   Signals   were   recorded   at   20   kHz   using   an   Intan   recording   system   (Intan Technologies, California, United States of America). The videos, captured at 30 fps with a Basler camera   (ace   Basler   106754),   were   synchronized   with   the   Intan   system   via   the   digital   input   for retrospective matching of animal behavior with electrophysiological data. Instantaneous speed was calculated using the neck position extracted from the videos using DeepLab Cut (DeepLabCut2.0 Toolbox, Mathis, A., et. all 2018). Preprocessing.   Electrophysiological   data   was   sampled   at   20   kHz   and   resampled   at   1250Hz   to extract   LFP   data.   Spikes   were   extracted   by   high-pass   filtering   and   thresholding   the   signal,   then clustered using Kilosort 2.5 (Steinmetz, et. al. 2019b) followed by manual curation using Phy (Rossant et al., 2016). Sleep stages were manually scored through visual inspection of the dorsal and ventral hippocampal spectrograms and accelerometer signals using TheStateEditor, a custom program from the   FMA   toolbox   (http://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net/).   We   defined   NREM   epochs   as   periods characterized   by   immobility   and   low   theta/delta   ratio,   while   REM   sleep   was   characterized   by immobility and regular theta waves (Figure S5). Ripple detection was performed by band-pass filtering (~100–200 Hz), squaring and z-scoring, and thresholding the field potential recorded in the dorsal and ventral CA1 pyramidal layer. SWRs were defined as events starting at 2 or 3 standard deviations (s.d.) and peaking at greater than 5 or 7 s.d. for dorsal or ventral SWRs, respectively. Ripple events in both regions could last less than 100 ms and more than 20 ms around the peak. Statistical   analysis.   Statistical   analyses   were   performed   using   Matlab   R2020a.   For   comparisons between the two groups, we used a two-tailed unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test. When analyzing more than two groups, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test for unpaired data and the Friedman test for paired, followed by the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test. If the data met the criteria for normality, we used Student's t-tests for two-group comparisons and one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer post- hoc test for multiple-group comparisons. Data presented in cumulative graphs were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Correlations between continuous variables were examined by linear regression.  A significance level of p<0.05  was  considered statistically significant unless otherwise stated. The specific tests used for each analysis are described in the figure legends or the text. Data distribution was visualized using scatter plots, with the mean plotted or box plots showing the median and quintiles. Analysis. All analyses were performed using customized toolboxes (Chronux, FMA toolbox), built-in functions, and custom-written scripts in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Dorsal-ventral ripples coordination. First, We constructed a peri-event histogram of ventral SWR peaks locked to dorsal ones using the ccg function from FMAtoolbox and normalized it to the total amount of ventral SWRs (10-msec bins). By visually inspecting the CCG, we defined coordinated events to those dorsal-ventral ripple pairs occurring +/-100ms from each other. To ascertain whether the percentage of coordinated dorsal and ventral ripples exceeded the chance level, we shuffled the referenced ripple peaks 100 times and calculated the percentage of coordinated reference ripples. This process yielded a surrogate average percentage value compared with the value obtained in each session. For autocorrelograms and crosscorrelograms in Figure 4, we used 10-msec bins. Ripple   bursts   analyses.   We   defined   a   ripple   burst   to   all   subsequent   ripple   peaks   with   <100ms between each other. The beginning and end of each burst were determined as the beginning of the first ripple and the end of the last one from the burst. To construct the cross-correlograms between dorsal and ventral ripple bursts, we also calculated the central time point of each event. Single-units analyses. We detected 1071 single units in the dHPC and 544in the vHPC. Units were classified   into   putative   pyramidal   cells   and   putative   interneurons   based   on   waveform   shape   as described previously (Bartho et al.,2004; Figure S3). Briefly, duration at 50% from baseline to peak (distance A) and peak-to-trough time (distance B) were utilized for clustering with k-means into 2 clusters, interneurons, and pyramidal cells. The gain firing rate locked to ripple peaks was calculated in 10-msec bin by dividing the firing rate in each bin by the baseline firing rate outside SPW-Rs (inter- ripple NREM intervals). To define if a unit was ripple-modulated, we performed a Poisson test with P < Assembly patterns detection. To do so, we constructed a spike train of each putative-pyr single unit using 25-ms, pooling dorsal and ventral units. Time bin was defined as it was proposed that at this time scale detection of assembly, expression is optimal (Harris et al., 2003; van de ven et al 2016), and after corroborating that different time bins (5, 10, 25, 50, 100 ms, data not shown) were not drastically   increasing   the   ratio   made   by   the   number   of   detected   assemblies   over   the   number   of significantly similar patterns. To avoid a bias due to a higher firing rate, spike trains were z-scored. Assembly patterns were identified using  a two-step process (Figure S6) described by Lopes-dos- Santos   et   al,   2013.   Briefly,   the   first   step   was   determining   the   number   of   significant   co-activation patterns present in each recording session. To do so, the algorithm counted the principal component variances that exceeded a threshold determined by an analytical probability function for uncorrelated data (Marčenko-Pastur distribution). Secondly, independent component analysis (ICA) was employed to   extract   the   assembly   patterns   from   the   data   projection   within   the   subspace   defined   by   initially detected significant principal components. As templates, we used mobility periods (>7 cm/sec during more than 2 seconds) in the Aversive or the Rewarded run sessions. After detecting the assembly patterns, those units whose weights exceeded the threshold defined as abs(1/√N)were defined as assembly   members.   If   members   were   coming   from   the   dorsal   or   ventral   hippocampal   units,   the assemblies were defined as dHPC or vHPC respectively. If they were coming from both regions, we named those as joint assemblies. To track assembly pattern expression over time (Figure S6), a projection matrix was created for each pattern using its weight vector's outer product, with the main diagonal set to zero. To maximize the role   of   members   in   assembly   activations,   we   set   to   zero   the   weight   of   non-member   units.   Each neuron's spike train was convolved with a Gaussian kernel and z-scored for high temporal resolution. The expression strength of a pattern at any time was defined by the quadratic form of its projection matrix with the smoothed and z-scored firing rate vector. Peaks in expression strength above 5 were identified   and   used   for   subsequent   analyses.   For   reactivation   rate   calculation,   we   counted   the reactivation peaks in 60-second bins during Pre- and Post-sleep. To minimize the overlap between the Post-sleep of the first emotional condition and the Pre-sleep of the second one, we restricted NREM   or   REM   epochs   to   those   occurring   1   hour   before   or   after   each   run   session.   For   Peak Reactivation   Strength   calculation,   we   averaged   the   reactivation   values   of   peaks   occurring   during Post-sleep and subtracted the average of the peak values in Pre-sleep. Finally, we divided by the average value of all peaks detected during both sleep sessions. Note that if this metric is positive and significantly different from zero, it means that the average reactivation peak values were higher in the Post-sleep   period.   We   also   measured   the   Reactivation   Strength   during   coordinated   and uncoordinated dorsal-ventral ripples.\",\n",

       "    'best_chunks': ['These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence. Episodic memory is supported by the hippocampus, a heterogeneous brain structure with distinct functional and anatomical properties along its dorsoventral axis (Fanselow and Dong 2010; Bannerman et al. 2004; Strange et al. 2014). The dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) encodes spatial representations of the environment through the activity of place cells, which code for specific locations called place fields (O’Keefe 1976; M. a Wilson and McNaughton 1993). During NREM sleep (slow- wave sleep), these spatial representations are reactivated (M. Wilson and McNaughton 1994; Skaggs and McNaughton 1996), preferentially during fast oscillatory hippocampal events known as “sharp-wave ripples” (SWRs) (Buzsáki 2015). Dorsal SWRs support spatial (Gabrielle Girardeau et al. 2009; Ego-Stengel and Wilson 2009) and contextual fear (Wang et al. 2015) memory consolidation. Interestingly, dHPC spatial representations can be modulated by the emotional valence of the environment, notably through remapping (Moita et al. 2004; D. Wang et al. 2015; Schuette et al. 2020; Hollup et al. 2001; Dupret et al. 2010). Moreover, dHPC sleep reactivations after an aversive experience can occur conjointly with the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (G. Girardeau, Inema, and Buzsáki 2017), which is involved in fear processing, and other emotion-processing structures (Lansink et al. 2008; 2009; Pennartz et al. 2009).',\n",

However, the dHPC has no direct anatomical connections with the BLA and only marginal ones with the rest of the emotional network, including the mPFC, nucleus Accumbens and VTA (Malik et al. 2022; Harvey et al. 2023). Compared to the dHPC, the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is understudied, particularly regarding its role in memory consolidation during sleep (Pronier, n.d.).',\n",
       "     'To study the respective and conjoint roles of the dHPC and the vHPC in the sleep-dependent processing of emotionally valenced experiences, we recorded neuronal activity in both regions simultaneously in rats performing a new task specifically designed to elicit the same behavior in the same spatial environments, but with opposing valences. These rats were subjected to aversive or reward-motivated exploration on a linear track, preceded and followed by sleep periods. We identified dorsal, ventral, and dorsoventral joint cell assemblies in the hippocampus that represented the aversive and reward conditions of the task. We then investigated whether those assemblies were reactivated during subsequent NREM sleep, the extent to which they coincide with the dorsoventral coordination of SWRs, and how these were influenced by emotional valence. Rats can perform the same exploratory behavior motivated by either reward or avoidance. To study dorsal-ventral hippocampal joint reactivations, we developed a behavioral task where animals have to perform the same exploratory behavior on a linear track but under different motivational contingencies associated with opposite valences. In the reward-motivated, positive contingency, the rats have to run back and forth on the linear track to obtain a drop of water at the end of each lap (Rewarded Run). The avoidance-motivated, aversive contingency was conducted on the same linear track and signaled by a single, constant light cue. During this session, animals were running back and forth to avoid an eyelid shock (Aversive Run) delivered after 20-30 seconds of immobility. (Figure 1A-B). During pre-training, the animals very rapidly learned to alternate for rewards, but the shock condition had to be gradually introduced to preserve the mobility and alternation behavior (Figure S1A). The experiments started at plateau performance for the number of shocks.',\n",
       "     'We detected dorsal and ventral SWRs during NREM sleep as well as neuronal assemblies during each exploration type and identified dorsal, ventral, and joint (dorso-ventral) assemblies. We found that dorso-ventral hippocampal coordination involves coordinated ripples and bursts of ripples. Aversive joint assemblies exhibited higher reactivation during non-REM sleep than the joint assemblies from the reward condition. Interestingly, joint aversive assemblies reactivated selectively during dorso-ventral coordinated ripples. Furthermore, their reactivation strength positively correlated with their strength of activation during the task. These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence.

       "     'SWRs propagate along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus, and marginal coordination of those events between dorsal and ventral parts has been reported during sleep without prior learning or emotional experience (Patel et al. 2013). We hypothesize that changes in the coordination of dorsal and ventral hippocampal ripples could foster the reactivation of joint dorso-ventral neuronal assemblies encoding the spatial and emotional components of an experience. To study the respective and conjoint roles of the dHPC and the vHPC in the sleep-dependent processing of emotionally valenced experiences, we recorded neuronal activity in both regions simultaneously in rats performing a new task specifically designed to elicit the same behavior in the same spatial environments, but with opposing valences.

A decoupled access/execute architecture template. This code has unpredictable control flow that causes frequent branch mis-predictions on CPUs and thread divergence on GPUs. Because of these limitations, and challenges with Moore’s Law and Dennard performance scaling, computer architects are interested in adding CPU/GPU structures to accelerate such code patterns, or even to use accelerators specialized for a given algorithm [26]. Many of the proposed architectures follow the decades-old idea of a Decoupled Access/Execute (DAE) architecture shown in Figure 1. In DAE, memory accesses are decoupled from computation to avoid stalls resulting from unpredictable loads [51]. The address generation unit (AGU) sends load and store requests to the data unit (DU), while the DU sends load values to and receives store values from the compute unit (CU). All communication is FIFO based and ideally the AGU to DU communication is one-directional, allowing the Figure 2. Comparison of a decoupled and non-decoupled address generation. Non-decoupled address generation re- sults in a later arrival of the store address, which stalls the RAW check for the next load, lowering load throughput. address streams from the AGU to run ahead w.r.t the CU. Figure 1a shows an example of such a DAE architecture implementing the earlier code snippet. DAE is a general technique applicable to many computa- tional models: it is used in specialized FPGA accelerators gen- erated from High-Level Synthesis (HLS) [11–13, 15, 16, 21, 54, 55]; in Coarse Grain Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) [20, 27, 37, 39, 43, 45, 46, 61]; and in CPU/GPU prefetchers [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47, 59]. For example, NVIDIA introduced hardware-accelerated asynchronous memory copies [3]. The CUDA programmer can provide a “copy descriptor” of a ten- sor to copy and the hardware will run ahead and generate the corresponding addresses in a Tensor Memory Unit. The common denominator of all these works is that they rely on either the programmer or the compiler to decouple address-generating instructions from the rest of the program. However, it has long been recognized that such a decoupling is not always possible [9, 57]. If any of the address-generating instructions for array A depend on a value loaded from A, then there is a loss-of-decoupling (LoD) [25]. Access patterns such as A[f(A[i])] are rare, but control dependencies that involve loads from A are common. For example, consider replacing C[i] with A[i] in our running example: Here, there is a LoD, because the A store is control-dependent on a branch that loads from A. Whereas before the load from C could be prefetched, now the AGU/DU communication is synchronized, because the AGU waits for A values from the DU before deciding if a store address should be generated, as shown in Figure 1b. In turn, the load waits for the store address to ensure that there is no aliasing—the store address is needed for memory disambiguation. As a result, the AGU cannot run ahead of the CU anymore, resulting in decreased pipeline parallelism, which Figure 2 illustrates. One approach for restoring decoupling in this case is con- trol speculation. As shown in Figure 1c, we can hoist the store request out of the if -condition in the AGU (specula- tion), and later poison the store in the CU on mis-speculation (store invalidation). However, it is unclear how the compiler should coordinate the speculation and recovery transfor- mations across two distinct control-flow graphs. While the example from Figure 1c is trivial, the task quickly becomes complicated with more speculated stores and nested control flow, as we demonstrate in the next section. The key chal- lenge here is to guarantee that the order of store requests sent from the AGU matches the order of store values or kill signals sent from the CU on all control-flow paths. General compiler support for speculated stores in DAE architectures is an open question that we tackle in this paper, making the following contributions: • We give a formal description of the fundamental rea- sons why address generation cannot always be decou- pled from the rest of the program (§4). • We describe compiler support for speculative memory in DAE architectures, solving the LoD problem due to control dependencies. We propose two algorithms: one for speculating memory requests in the AGU, and one for poisoning mis-speculations in the CU (§5). • We prove that our speculation approach preserves the sequential consistency of the original program and does not introduce deadlocks (§6). • We show that our work enables DAE on a wider class of codes than before, with applications in CPU/GPU prefetchers, CGRAs, and FPGA accelerators. • We evaluate our DAE speculation approach on accel- erators generated from HLS implementing codes from the graph and data analytics domain. We achieve an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup over the baseline HLS implementations. We show that our approach has no mis-speculation penalty and minimal code size impact (average accelerator area increase < 5%) (§8). 2 Motivating Example In this brief section, we show why an obvious approach to speculation in DAE architectures is incorrect. The FIFO-based nature of DAE requires that the order of memory requests (speculative or not) generated in the AGU matches exactly the order of load/store values (poisoned or not) in the CU. The motivating example in Figure 1c contains just one speculative store and one path through the compute CFG where the speculation becomes unreachable, making the problem of ordering trivial in that case. Consider the more complex code in Figure 3a with three stores 𝑠0, 𝑠1, and 𝑠2. Speculating all store requests in the AGU might result in the store request order (𝑠2, 𝑠0, 𝑠1). In the CU, we need to guarantee the same order of corresponding store values (poisoned or not) on every possible control-flow path through the loop. Unfortunately, the obvious approach that worked for the trivial example in Figure 1c does not work Figure 3. Poisoning speculated stores immediately when they become unreachable results in an ordering mismatch between AGU store requests from and CU store values. here. If we poison values at points where the corresponding speculation becomes unreachable, as illustrated in Figure 3b, then we end up with three possible orderings of store values depending on the CFG path in the CU, but only one of the orderings is correct. This is why any previous implemen- tations of speculative stores in DAE architectures has only considered trivial triangle or diamond shaped CFGs [24], like the one in Figure 1c. Generalized compiler support for store speculation that guarantees the correct order of poisoning is the key challenge that we solve in this paper. 3 Background In this section, we describe the architectural support needed to enable speculative DAE and some compiler preliminaries. Our speculation technique requires architectural support for predicated stores and FIFOs. Store values are tagged with a poison bit that, when set, causes the corresponding store request to be dropped in the DU without committing a store. We say that a store request gets killed (or poisoned) if its corresponding store value has the poison bit set. This is a lightweight form of speculation that does not require replays in the CU and does not result in out-of-bounds stores, be- cause mis-speculated stores are never committed. Speculative loads can be supported by simply discarding the value of a mis-speculated load. Predicated stores are easy to support in hardware since the underlying memory protocol usually already uses a valid signal. For example, the commonly used AXI4 interface [4] has a strobe signal to indicate which bytes are valid. Architectural FIFOs (queues) are also commonly added in works on CPU/GPU microarchitecture or can be relatively cheaply implemented in software. For example, works on DAE CPU/GPU prefetchers add architectural FIFOs and ex- tend the ISA with instructions for producing load/store ad- dresses and consuming/producing store values [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47]. The prefetcher from [24] enables predicated stores with a store_inv instruction, but the authors support only simple triangle or diamond control flow patterns, calling for future work on general speculation support. We discuss concrete ex- amples of architectures that can benefit from our work in §7. We evaluate our work on accelerators generated from HLS, where we have complete control of the memory interfaces. We use an SSA-based compiler representation and associated analyses [49]. In particular, we use the control-flow graph and dominator tree to calculate control dependencies [40], and we use the SSA def-use chain for data dependencies. We use a canonical loop representation: loops have a sin- gle header block and a single loop backedge going from the loop latch to the loop header. Our transformation assumes re- ducible control flow—CFG edges can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, forward and back edges, such that the forward edges form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Irreducible con- trol flow can be made reducible with node splitting [7, 44]. For completeness, we briefly describe how our compiler implements a DAE architecture: 1. AGU: For each memory operation to be decoupled, we change it to a send_ld_addr or a send_st_addr function that sends the memory address to the DU. 2. CU: Dually, in the CU we change each decoupled mem- ory operation to a consume_val or produce_val func- tion that receives or sends values to or from the DU. 3. Dead Code Elimination: We run a standard DCE pass in the CU to remove the now unnecessary address generation code. In the AGU, we delete all side effect instructions that are not part of the address generation def-use chains, and then also run a standard DCE pass. We also use a control-flow simplification pass that removes empty blocks potentially created by DCE. The send_ld_addr, send_st_addr, consume_val, and produce_val functions are implementation dependent. For example, if we target CPU/GPU prefetchers, such as [17, 24], then these would translate to instructions. For accelerators, they would be translated to FIFO writes/reads. 4 Loss-of-Decoupling Analysis LoD events arise when the address generation for a given memory access depends on a load that cannot be trivially prefetched, causing the AGU, DU, and CU communication to be synchronized. By non-trivially prefetched we mean loads that have a RAW hazards, i.e., the DU needs to receive all previous store addresses in program order to perform memory disambiguation before executing the load. Given a set of address-generating instructions 𝐺, and a set of memory load instructions 𝐴 using addresses generated by instructions in 𝐺, there is a loss of decoupling if: Definition 4.1 (LoD Data Dependency). There exists a path in the def-use chain from 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 to 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺. While en- countering a 𝜙-node on the def-use chain leading to 𝑔, we also trace the def-use paths of the terminator instructions 𝑇 in the 𝜙-node incoming basic blocks to see if any terminator instruction in 𝑇 depends on any 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴. Definition 4.2 (LoD Control Dependency). There exists an instruction 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺 that is control-dependent on a branch instruction 𝑏, and there is a path in the def-use chain from 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 to 𝑏. We call the basic block that contains 𝑏 the LoD control dependency source. Note that the LoD control dependency source need not be the immediate control dependency of 𝑔, and that 𝑔 might have multiple LoD control dependencies. Depending on the hardware context, the definition of the 𝐴 set can be expanded or narrowed. For example, if the AGU is implemented in hardware with limited control flow support, then 𝐴 could include all branch instructions. On the other hand, given an address generating instruction, we could limit 𝐴 to only include loads from the same array for which the given address is generated—this could be useful if we only want to preserve decoupling for that array and do not care about losing decoupling for other arrays. Our speculation technique applies equally well to all these definitions. An example of a LoD data dependency is the A[f(A[i])] access. Our speculation approach does not recover decou- pling for such cases, but fortunately such accesses are rare. An example of a more common LoD data dependency is the code pattern if (A[i]) A[i++] = 1. In this case, the def-use chain leading to the definition of the store address contains a 𝜙-node (i) whose value depends on loading from 𝐴. Such a pattern is sometimes found in algorithms that operate on dy- namically growing data structures, e.g. queues or stacks. Our speculation technique does not work on such cases either, but this is not a large limitation, since performance oriented codes typically do not use dynamically growing structures, instead opting for implementations with bounded space re- quirements that can be allocated statically [62]. An example of LoD due to a control dependency is shown in Figure 1b. This case is much more common than a direct data dependency and is the focus of this paper. Algorithm 1 Control-flow hoisting of AGU requests 1: Input: 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 list of blocks that are the source of a LoD control dependency (defined in §4) 2: Output: 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 { basic block: list of hoisted re- quests to this block } 3: 4: for 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 do 5: 6: ⊲ traverse the DAG from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch for 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 (𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵) do if 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 contains memory requests then hoist 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚𝐵𝐵 requests to the end of 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 add requests to 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 [𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵] 5 Compiler Support for Speculation We now describe our dual transformations that enable spec- ulation in the AGU and poison mis-speculations in the CU. Algorithm 1 describes our approach to introducing specu- lation in the AGU. Given a LoD control dependency source block 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 we hoist all memory requests that are control de- pendent on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the end of 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. There can be multiple blocks with memory requests that have a LoD control depen- dency on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵, which poses the question in which order should they be hoisted to 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. We use reverse post-order in Algorithm 1. Assuming reducible control flow, the CFG region from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch is a DAG. The reverse post-order of a DAG is its topological order. Topological ordering gives us the useful property that given two distinct basic blocks 𝐴 and 𝐵 in a given loop, if 𝐴 ≺ 𝐵 in any path through the loop then 𝐴 ≺ 𝐵 in the topological ordering. Note that there can be multiple topological orderings for a DAG, but it does not matter which one is chosen in our algorithm. Algorithm 1 traverses the CFG region from 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the end of its loop (or to the end of the function if 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 is not in a loop). During the traversal, we ignore CFG edges leading to loop headers—we do not enter loops other than the innermost loop containing 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵. 5.1.1 Example of Hoisting. Consider the CFG from Fig- ure 4a. There are three LoD control dependency source blocks (2, 3, 5) and five blocks with memory requests (blocks 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 with requests 𝑎, 𝑐, 𝑏, 𝑑, 𝑒, respectively). Assume that each block holds a single memory request—multiple memory requests within the same block are treated in the same way by our algorithms. Figure 4c shows the topological order of the loop (block 1 is omitted for brevity). Algorithm 1 will hoist 𝑏, 𝑒 to the end of block 2, and 𝑐, 𝑑, 𝑒 to the end of block 3—the result is presented in Figure 4b. Note that the requests 𝑏 and 𝑒 were hoisted to both block 2 and 3, because they are reachable from both blocks. Nothing is hoisted to block 1 since it is not a LoD control dependency source. Figure 4. An example of introducing speculative memory requests in the AGU (§5.1); and poisoned stores in the CU (§5.2). Block 6 in subfigure (d) kills stores c, b, then uses the allocation for store d, and then kills store e. 5.1.2 Nested LoD Control Dependencies. Block 5 in Figure 4b does not contain any speculative requests because it itself has a LoD control dependency on block 2 and 3. Algorithm 1 considers only LoD control dependency source blocks that are not themselves the destination of another LoD control dependency. Given a chain of nested LoD control dependencies, we only consider the chain head. For example, the Figure 4a CFG has two LoD control dependency chains: 2, 5 and 3, 5—Algorithm 1 considers only blocks 2 and 3. Algorithm 2 Mapping Poison Stores to CFG Edges in CU 1: Input: 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 { basic block: list of requests hoisted to this block in Algorithm 1 } for 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ ∈ 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑇𝑜𝐿𝑜𝑜𝑝𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵) do 2: 3: for 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵, 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 ∈ 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑀𝑎𝑝 do 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ← block where 𝑟 is true 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠.𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 (𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵) 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 ← ∅ for 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 do ⊲ set keeps insertion order 5.1.3 Why Topological Order in Algorithm 1? Topo- logical order is needed to make it possible to match the order of speculative requests made in the AGU with the order of values that will arrive from the CU on all its possible CFG paths. Consider, for example, the requests 𝑏 and 𝑐 in Fig- ure 4a. We first want to hoist 𝑐 to block 3 before hoisting 𝑏, because there exists a CFG path where 𝑐 comes before 𝑏, but not vice versa. If 𝑏 were hoisted before 𝑐, then the speculative requests order would be 𝑏 ≺ 𝑐, which would be impossible to match with values in the CU on the CFG path 3, 5, 7. for 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ∈ 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ do for 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 do if 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 then ⊲ to the next edge if 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 not reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 then ⊲ reachability ignores loop backedges poison 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 requests on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ⊲ Alg. 3 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠.𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒 (𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵) Our strategy for poisoning misspeculations in the CU is to first map a poison call to a CFG edge, and then to map that edge to a poison store call contained in an existing or newly created basic block. Algorithm 2 describes the first step. Given block 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 that contains speculative memory requests 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠, we consider each path in the DAG from the 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 to the loop latch (or function exit) in the CU. We call the block where a 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 becomes true the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 (for example, the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 for request 𝑏 in Figure 4a is block 5). For each CFG path, we use the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 list to keep track of which requests were already used or poisoned on the path—the list contains the 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 for each 𝑟 ∈ 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠. Given an edge in the traversal, the edge is skipped if the next 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 ∈ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 is still reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . This guarantees that the order of speculative requests in the AGU matches the order of values in the CU, i.e., a speculative request for a given 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 block is not poisoned immedi- ately when 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 becomes unreachable if there is an earlier speculative request that can still be used. 5.2.1 Example of Mapping Poison Stores to CFG Edges. Figure 4c shows which CFG edges are poisoned given the original CFG in Figure 4a and the AGU CFG in Figure 4b. For Algorithm 3 Poisoning Stores on Edges in CU 1: Input: store request 𝑟 ; CFG 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒; block 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 where 𝑟 was speculated; block 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 where 𝑟 is true ⊲ preserve set across calls get from 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒 if exists 2: 3: 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒 ← ∅ 4: if 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 is reachable from 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 then 5: 6: 7: 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 ← create new block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 or append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the end of 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒.𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 (𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵) 8: 9: else if 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 does not dominate 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 then 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 ← create new block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 10: append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the end of 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 11: 12: 13: create 𝜙 (1, 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵) value in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 branch from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 on 𝜙 = 1 ⊲ create recursively on 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 → 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 paths append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to the start of 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 example, the path 3 → 5 → 𝐿 will have: 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) on the 3 → 5 edge; and 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑑), 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑒) on the 5 → 𝐿 edge (4th path from block 3 in Figure 4c). 5.2.2 Mapping Poisoned Edges to Basic Blocks. Algo- rithm 3 shows how poisoned CFG edges are mapped to actual poison calls placed in a concrete basic block. Given a poi- soned request 𝑟 on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 (from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 block to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 block), the 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 block where 𝑟 was speculated in the AGU, and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 where r becomes true there are three cases: 1. There exists a path from 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . In this case, we cannot insert 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , because we would end up with a CFG path where the store is both true and poisoned. To avoid this, we create a new 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 block on 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to it. 2. There exists a path from the loop header to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 that does not contain 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵. In this case, we cannot insert 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) in 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , because we would end up with a CFG path where 𝑟 was not speculated in the AGU, but was poisoned in the CU. To avoid this, we create a new block 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 on the edge and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) to it. We also add steering instructions to the path from 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 that will branch from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 to 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛𝐵𝐵 only if 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 was encountered on the current CFG path. 3. Otherwise, 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑟 ) can safely be prepended to the start of 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . Algorithm 3 is executed only once per (𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒, 𝑟 ) tuple—a given request is poisoned at most once on a given edge. Also, poison blocks created in case 1 in Algorithm 3 can be reused to poison other requests. Figure 5. Basic blocks with the same list of poison stores and the same immediate successor can be merged in the CU. 5.2.3 Example of Mapping Poison Edges to Blocks. Consider how the poisoned edges in Figure 4c are mapped to basic blocks in Figure 4d. Case 1: Store 𝑐 is poisoned on the 3 → 5 edge. Since there is a path from the true block of 𝑐 (block 4) to the edge destination block (block 5), we create a new block on the 3 → 5 edge and append 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) to it. Case 2: Store 𝑑 is poisoned on both the 5 → 7 and 5 → 𝐿 edges. The 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝐵𝐵 for 𝑑 is block 3. Since there exists the path 𝐻 → 1 → 2 → 5 that does not contain block 3, we create a new block on the 5 → 7 edge with the 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑑) call. We add steering instructions to the 3 → 5 and 3 → 4 → 5 paths that will cause block 5 to branch to the new poison block on the 5 → 7 edge only if block 5 was reached from a path containing block 3. Case 3: Store 𝑐 is also poisoned on the 3 → 6 edge, but here it is safe to prepend 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑐) to the start of block 6. Case 1 and 2 of Algorithm 3 might create multiple poison blocks for the same store on different CFG edges. It is possible to merge two poison blocks into one if they contain the same list of poison stores and if they have the same list of immediate successors. When merging, we keep instructions from just one block. We apply such merging iteratively after Algorithms 2 and 3. For example, Figure 5 contains a CFG sub- region of our running example from Figure 4. Algorithm 3 inserted poison blocks 10, 11, 12, 13 to poison stores 𝑑 and 𝑒. Block pairs (11, 13) and (10, 12) can be merged. Speculative loads are relatively easy to support. To match the order of load_consume calls in the CU with the order of speculative send_load_addr calls in the AGU we can hoist the load_consume calls to the same block where the corresponding send_load_addr were hoisted in the AGU. Then, the CU can either use the load value or discard it. After hoisting, we need to update all 𝜙 instructions that use the load value, since the basic block containing the loaded value will have changed. Alternatively, we can transform 𝜙 instructions using the load value into select instructions. 6 Safety and Liveness We prove that our transformations preserve the sequential consistency of the original program and that they do not introduce deadlock. Deadlock freedom is a corollary of se- quential consistency, so we focus only on the latter. We show that on every CFG path the order of speculative store requests in the AGU matches the order of store values in the CU, and that the non-poisoned store value sequence in the CU matches the store sequence of the original code. In the following discussion, we assume blocks with a sin- gle store; the proof trivially extends to blocks with multi- ple stores since all speculative stores in the same block are treated the same. We also assume that all stores are specula- tive, since the relative order between non-speculative and speculative stores is guaranteed by definition: given a a non- speculative store 𝑠1 and a speculative store 𝑠2, Algorithm 1 will not change the relative program order of 𝑠1 and 𝑠2, i.e., if 𝑠1 ≺ 𝑠2 in the original program order, then it is not possible to hoist 𝑠2 such that 𝑠2 ≺ 𝑠1. This follows from the con- trol dependency definition (§4)—𝑠2 hoisting stops at its LoD control dependency source 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵, which must come after the block containing 𝑠1 in topological order. If 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 would come after 𝑠1 in topological order, then the block containing 𝑠1 would also have a LoD control dependency on 𝑠𝑟𝑐𝐵𝐵 and would have been hoisted, which is a contradiction since we assumed that 𝑠1 was non-speculative. A similar argument can be made if 𝑠2 ≺ 𝑠1 in the original program. Lemma 6.1 (Sequential Consistency). Given an ordered list of 𝑛 speculative store requests 𝐿𝑎 = {𝑎0, 𝑎1, ..., 𝑎𝑛−1} made in the AGU loop CFG on some fixed iteration 𝑘, Algorithms 2 and 3 transform the CU CFG such that every possible path through its loop CFG on iteration 𝑘 produces an or- dered list of 𝑛 tagged store values 𝐿𝑣 = {(𝑣0, 𝑝0), (𝑣1, 𝑝1), ..., (𝑣𝑛−1, 𝑝𝑛−1)}, such that each (𝑎𝑖, 𝑣𝑖, 𝑝𝑖 ), 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛 triple cor- responds to a 𝐴[𝑎𝑖 ] ← 𝑣𝑖 store in the original program CFG, and 𝑝𝑖 = 1 (poison bit) if that store is not executed on the path through the original loop CFG on iteration 𝑘. Proof. We use a proof by induction on the transformed CFG. Base case: 𝐿𝑎 = ∅ (no speculated requests in the AGU). Algorithm 2 does not change the CU CFG. Thus, the order of store addresses in the AGU and store values in the CU trivially matches, 𝐿𝑎 = 𝐿𝑣 = ∅. Inductive hypothesis: assume Lemma 6.1 holds at basic block 𝐵𝑖 in the current CFG path. All store requests 𝑎 𝑗 ∈ 𝐿𝑎 contained in blocks reached before 𝐵𝑖 in the path were matched with the correct store value call (𝑣 𝑗, 𝑝 𝑗 ) ∈ 𝐿𝑣, such that 𝑝 𝑗 = 1 if 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗 ] ← 𝑣 𝑗 was not executed on the path in the original loop CFG. Inductive step: The next store address in the AGU 𝐿𝑎 se- quence is 𝑎 𝑗+1 ∈ 𝐿𝑎. The next store value in the CU CFG path should be (𝑣 𝑗+1, 𝑝 𝑗+1) ∈ 𝐿𝑣, where 𝑝 𝑗+1 = 1 iff the store 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗+1] ← 𝑣 𝑗+1 is not reached on the current CFG path in the original program. Algorithm 2 considers the 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑟𝑐 → 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 next. There are three cases: 1. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵, where 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is the block contain- ing the store 𝐴[𝑎 𝑗+1] ← 𝑣 𝑗+1 in the original program CFG. In this case, Algorithm 2 will not poison this store on this path through the CU CFG, i.e., the next item in the 𝐿𝑣 sequence will be the correct (𝑣 𝑗, 0). 2. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 ≠ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is not reachable from 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 , in which case Algorithm 2 will insert a poison store on this edge. Algorithm 3 will map this poison store to a basic block, with the effect that taking the 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 will result in the poison call being executed and control transferring to 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 . The next item in the 𝐿𝑣 sequence will be the correct (𝑣 𝑗, 1). 3. 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑡 ≠ 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 and 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝐵𝐵 is reachable from 𝐵𝑙 , in which case Algorithm 2 will traverse the path until Case 1 or 2 is matched. Since Lemma 6.1 holds for the base case, for basic blocks on the path up to 𝐵𝑖 , and for some successor block of 𝐵𝑖 , it must hold at any block on the path. If it holds at any block on the path, it holds for the whole path. Since a given store request 𝑟 is poisoned at most once on a given CFG edge and since, by definition of Algorithm 2, any given path will contain at most one edge where 𝑟 is poisoned, we conclude □ that Lemma 6.1 holds for all paths. 7 Applications In this section, we highlight three applications for our work: DAE-based prefetchers in CPUs/GPUs, CGRAs, and special- ized accelerators generated from HLS. In the next section, we choose HLS as an evaluation vehicle due to its simplicity compared to CPU/GPU prefetchers where the evaluation results can easily be polluted by other architectural factors like cache behavior, branch prediction, etc. However, we em- phasize that our speculation support in DAE does not rely on any HLS-specific features and can be applied wherever speculation is combined with the DAE technique. Most existing works on CPU/GPU prefetchers follow the DAE principle and rely on the compiler to decoupled address generation from compute [3, 5, 17, 18, 24, 38, 47]. All of these works suffer from the control-dependency loss of decoupling (LoD) problem (§4). The work in [24] discusses adding spec- ulation and predicated stores to the CPU microarchitecture to mitigate LoD, but their compiler only supports simple diamond and triangle control flow shapes. In this paper, we have demonstrated generalized compiler support for specu- lation in DAE, making these works viable for general control flow and thus applicable to a broader set of codes. 7.1.1 Example. The CPU prefetcher proposed in [24] (on which most of the other work is based) separates address gen- eration from compute and extends the ISA with store_addr, load_produce, store_val, load_consume, and store_inv instructions that can be directly targeted by our compiler. A CGRA consists of an array of PEs, each with small memo- ries, connected by a network. A CGRA compiler is typically co-designed with the hardware, as the PEs are typically stat- ically scheduled. The job of the compiler is to map the Con- trol/Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to the PEs, and many works follow the DAE technique to tackle the memory wall prob- lem [20, 27, 37, 39, 43, 45, 46, 61]. Our work can help mitigate LoD events when mapping to CGRAs. 7.2.1 Example. The CGRA proposed in [39] is an example of a modern streaming dataflow CGRA. All communication in the CGRA is FIFO-based, and address generation is ex- plicitly decoupled at compile time into AGUs. The compiler generates commands to produce address streams, and to consume or produce values. Control flow is handled with predication and there is a SD_Clean_Port command to throw away a value from an output port that can be used to imple- ment predicated stores. In HLS, the CDFG of an algorithm is implemented directly in hardware following a spatial execution model with the freedom to customize the memory system. This makes de- coupling easier in HLS compared to the temporal CPU/GPU execution model. HLS-generated accelerators can directly benefit from our work today without any changes, and it is in this domain that we evaluate our implementation in the next section. Although existing HLS compilers are successful in build- ing non-trivial accelerators for regular code (e.g., [48]), their static scheduling techniques are sub-optimal for irregular codes (for the same reason why traditional VLIW compilers were sub-optimal for irregular codes). Many research works in academia and industry have exploited DAE in HLS to improve the efficiency of HLS-generated accelerators for ir- regular codes [11–13, 15, 16, 21, 53–55]. By adding compiler speculation support, DAE in HLS can be used on a broader set of codes, which we demonstrate in the next section. 8 Evaluation In this section, we answer the following questions: • What is the performance benefit of using a DAE ar- chitecture (enabled by our speculation approach) to accelerate codes with LoD control dependencies? • What is the cost of mis-speculation in our approach? • What is the impact on code size (accelerator area usage) of our speculation approach? • What is the scalability for nested control flow, which increases the number of poison stores and blocks? We make our work and evaluation publicly available [52]. Figure 6. Performance of DAE, SPEC and ORACLE normalized to STA. SPEC achieves an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup. We generate algorithm-specific accelerators using HLS tar- geting an Intel Arria 10 FPGA. The C codes are taken directly from benchmark suites without adding any HLS-specific an- notations (excluding dynamic structures, like queues, that were replaced with HLS-specific libraries). We use the LLVM-based Intel SYCL HLS compiler [29] and apply our standard DAE transformation (§3.2) and our proposed speculation transformation (§5) as LLVM passes. The codes use deterministic dual-ported on-chip SRAM ca- pable of 1 read and 1 write per cycle. To enable out-of-order loads, we use a load-store queue (LSQ) designed for HLS (load/store queue sizes of 4/32), which is commonly found on accelerators for irregular codes [1, 24, 31, 53]. We report cycle counts from ModelSim simulations. We do not report circuit frequency since our approach does not affect the critical path (see [52] for such details). Area usage is obtained after place and route using Quartus 19.2. 8.1.1 Baselines. For each benchmark, we synthesize the following architectures which represent current state-of-the- art approaches to HLS : • STA: the default, industry-grade approach using static scheduling [29]. Loads that cannot be disambiguated at compile time execute in order. • DAE: a DAE architecture without speculation. OoO loads are enabled by an LSQ. This is the state-of-the- art approach to irregular codes in academia [53], but it suffers from control-dependency LoDs. • SPEC: the same as DAE, but with our speculation tech- nique which mitigates control-dependency LoDs. • ORACLE: the same as DAE, but all LoD control depen- dencies are removed manually from the input code. The ORACLE results are wrong, but give a bound on the performance of SPEC and show its area overhead. 8.1.2 Benchmarks. DAE architectures optimize the la- tency between memory and compute and are most beneficial for memory-bound codes [24], especially codes with an irreg- ular memory access pattern that prevents static prefetching [18]. We evaluate nine such benchmarks from the graph and data analytics domain, using the GAP graph benchmark Table 1. Absolute performance and area usage of STA [29], DAE [53], SPEC, and ORACLE accelerators. (*bc uses two LSQs). bfs bc sssp hist thr mm fw sort spmv suite [8] and an HLS benchmark suite [14] of irregular pro- grams. We select only codes that can benefit from our SPEC approach, i.e., codes with LoD control dependencies: • bfs: breadth-first traversal through a graph. • bc: betweenness centrality of a single node in a graph. • sssp: single shortest path from a single node to all other nodes in a graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm. • hist: histogram, similar to Figure 1b (size 1000). • thr: zeroes RGB pixels above threshold (size 1000). • mm: maximal matching in a bipartite graph (2000 edges). • fw: Floyd-Warshall distance calculation of all node-to- node pairs in a dense graph (10×10 distance matrix). • sort: using bitonic mergesort (size 64). • spvm: sparse vector matrix multiply (20×20 matrix). For the graph codes (bfs, bc, sssp) we use a real-world graph email-Eu-core with 1005 nodes and 25,571 edges. Figure 6 reports normalized speedups of each technique over STA. Our SPEC approach gives on average a 1.9× (and up to 3×) speedup over STA. This is within 5% of the ORACLE performance. In contrast, DAE without speculation sees a dramatic performance degradation over STA, because the AGU, DU, CU communication is sequentialized. 8.2.1 Mis-speculation Cost. The SPEC and ORACLE per- formance gap is highest on the bfs and bc codes, because of its deep pipeline between the load and store that form a RAW hazard. The deep pipeline means that more store allocations need to be held by the LSQ to guarantee perfect pipelining [34]. This, together with a high mis-speculation rate in these benchmarks (Table 1), can cause the LSQ to fill with store addresses that are mis-speculated, potentially stalling later loads that have to wait for future store addresses to arrive. This problem can be solved by increasing the store queue size in the LSQ. The increased number of requests and the need for more buffering is one of the limitations of our approach. Codes with a shallower pipeline that do not need large LSQ sizes have no mis-speculation penalty. To prove this, we choose three benchmarks where we can instrument the input data so that we can vary the mis- speculation rate. Table 2 shows how the mis-speculation cost changes as the mis-speculation rate increases. As can be seen, there is no correlation between the mis-speculation rate and cost, with the slight variability in clock cycle counts attributable to the subtle difference in the number of true RAW hazards due to the varying data distribution. Table 2. SPEC cycle counts as mis-speculation rate changes. hist thr mm Mis-speculation rate Our speculation approach can increase the number of blocks in the CU, especially for codes with deeply nested control flow. In HLS, an increased number of blocks can result in a higher area usage due to larger scheduler complexity [50]. Table 1 shows the absolute area usage of all accelerators. We observe virtually no area overhead of SPEC over ORACLE on the evaluated benchmarks. This is because most of the codes have at most two control-flow nesting levels where new poison blocks are inserted, and sometimes it is possible to reduce the number of blocks using our merging technique (e.g., two poison blocks in mm merged into one). 8.3.1 Impact of Nested Control Flow on Area Usage. To give a more meaningful measure of how nested control flow impacts the area overhead of our SPEC approach, we create a synthetic benchmark template where we can tune the number of poison blocks generated by SPEC: for HLS with speculation support [23]. The speculation sup- port in this and other works requires costly recovery on mis-speculation [6, 22, 30, 35, 56, 60]. Efficiently squashing speculative computation on the wrong paths in a spatial dataflow architecture is hard, because the architectural state is distributed [10]. Our speculative DAE sidesteps this issue, not requiring any recovery: we speculate early (run ahead) in the AGU, and later handle mis-speculations in the CU by taking an appropriate path in its CFG. Control-flow handling in GPUs is usually implemented via predication. The algorithms used to calculate predicate masks and re-convergence points resemble our work [32]. The SIMT stack approach in GPUs pushes predicate masks onto a stack when entering a control-flow nesting level, and pops when exiting. Our Algorithm 1 implementing specula- tive requests can be seen as a pass through the CFG with only push operations, where the push is onto individual stacks of control-dependency sources. Dually, our inserting of poison calls in Algorithm 1 can be seen as a pass through the CFG with only pop operations where the placement of the pops follows a certain policy just like modern SIMT compilers fol- low different policies to prevent SIMT deadlock and livelock, or to improve performance [19], instead of popping at the immediate post-dominator. 10 Conclusion We have presented general compiler support for specula- tive memory operations in DAE architectures that tackles the LoD problem resulting from control dependencies. We have proposed CFG transformations implementing specula- tion in the address generation slice, and poisoning of mis- speculations in the compute slice, with a proof of correctness. We have presented three applications where our work im- proves support for the efficient execution of irregular codes: DAE-based CPU/GPU prefetchers that require compiler sup- port, CGRA architectures, and HLS-generated specialized accelerators. We have evaluated our work on HLS-generated accelerators, showing an average 1.9× (up to 3×) speedup over non-DAE accelerators on a set of irregular benchmarks where DAE is not possible without our speculation. Our ap- proach has no mis-speculation cost and a small code size footprint, scaling well to deeply nested control flow. Future work could investigate vector-parallelism support by filling a vector of speculative requests in the AGU and producing a store mask in the CU, similar to the recent work on decoupled vector runahead prefetching in CPUs [36].

Change in area and performance overhead of SPEC over ORACLE as the number of poison blocks and calls grows. if 𝑥 > 0 then 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒1 if 𝑥 > 1 then 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒2 if 𝑥 > 2 then ... poison calls. Each nesting level in this template will result in one poison block in the SPEC architecture. With 𝑛 stores, and assuming one store per nesting level, there will be 𝑛 poison blocks and 𝑛 𝑖=1 Figure 7 shows how the area and performance overhead of SPEC over ORACLE changes as more poison blocks are needed. The performance overhead is close to 0% and does not change with more poison blocks. The area overhead of the AGU unit is similarly close to 0%, because SPEC hoists stores out of the if -conditions, causing the blocks to be deleted. The area overhead of the CU unit grows by a few percent (< 5%) with each added poison block, but even for the pathological case of eight nested if -conditions the overhead is below 25%. In real codes, with more compute and lower control-flow nesting, the area overhead of SPEC should be minimal. 9 Related Work Program slicing is used beyond DAE architectures. Decoupled Software Pipelining (DSWP) [41] is a popular transforma- tion that decouples strongly connected components in the program dependence graph into separate pipeline stages mapped over multiple PEs communicating via FIFOs. The PEs can be CPU threads, or pipeline stages in an accelerator generated by HLS [33]. Control dependent pipeline stages in DSWP can also be executed speculatively, although stages with memory operations require versioned memory [58]. Control speculation has its roots in compilers for VLIW ma- chines. Instruction scheduling in HLS is very similar to VLIW scheduling (no hardware support for speculation, static map- ping to functional units, etc.), with many algorithms like modulo-scheduling and if -conversion originally developed for VLIW directly applicable to HLS [2, 42, 50]. Most recently, predicated execution in the form of gated SSA was proposed',\n",

E-mail(s): hhezju@zju.edu.cn; xinian.zuo@bnu.edu.cn; †These authors contributed equally to this work. The amygdala is indispensable for mood regulation, cognitive learning, and memory consolidation, and has been closely associated with behavioral pathologies, particularly during critical stages of socio-emotional maturation such as childhood and adoles- cence (Sammallahti et al, 2023; Chai et al, 2023; Par´e and Headley, 2023). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain tissue structures enables a detailed examination and volumetric analysis of the amygdala, facilitating the construction of developmental neuropsychiatric conditions (Song, 2023; Ben-Zion et al, 2023). Therefore, a volumetric analysis based on a precise segmentation of the amygdala is essential for these studies. Amygdala segmentation has relied on histological atlases and manual segmen- tation techniques utilizing in vivo neuroimaging data. However, while serving as a golden standard, these methods predominantly involve manual labeling, making them labor intensive and prone to errors. Given the necessity to process large datasets, this task becomes particularly cumbersome and requires the development of automatic segmentation methods. A frequently used technique in automatic methods involves probabilistic estimates derived from Markov random fields (Fischl et al, 2002) to assign voxel labels in anatomical MRI images. This approach has been widely implemented in popular software such as FreeSurfer (Fischl et al, 2002), achieving notable segmen- tation performance (Trombini et al, 2023). Other research has used Bayesian methods to delineate brain anatomical boundaries (Patenaude et al, 2011), based on the sig- nal intensity of MRI images and the structural configurations defined by established atlases, such as those used in FSL-FIRST and similar segmentation algorithms (Liu and Chou, 2023). In addition, multi-atlas label fusion segmentation techniques (Xie et al, 2023) integrate information from multiple atlases to reduce mislabeling errors resulting from inaccurate registrations and mitigate the inherent instability of MRI data. This methodology has proven particularly effective in scenarios involving high variability in Markov random fields covering individual disparities and pathological lesions, and has been incorporated into volBrain (Manj´on and Coup´e, 2016) and more recent algorithms (Xie et al, 2023; Liu et al, 2023b). Despite the plethora of available automated brain image segmentation tools, including FreeSurfer and volBrain, it is noteworthy that these toolkits were not developed exclusively for amygdala segmentation. Recent investigations have revealed significant discrepancies in the quantitative estimates of amygdala volume when using existing software algorithms, which can affect the validity of amygdala-centric research findings (Zhou et al, 2021). That is, inaccurate segmentation can introduce systematic biases, compromising the precision and reliability of volumetric measurements. In summary, the accurate segmentation of the human amygdala poses several chal- lenges. Firstly, the amygdala constitutes merely 0.05% of the entire brain, making it susceptible to false positive segmentations. Secondly, although there are distinct class differences between the amygdala and adjacent tissue structures, these differences are minimal, only about 12.6%, compared to surrounding tissues. The complexity of neighboring structures further complicates the segmentation task due to low contrast issues (Pruessner et al, 2000; Fischl et al, 2002; Manj´on and Coup´e, 2016). In this Methods paper, we propose an innovative algorithm to take advantage of manually traced large-scale amygdalae (Zhou et al, 2021) for the transformer model (Lee et al, 2022) that emphasizes boundary delineation to address the challenges mentioned above in automated amygdala segmentation. We delineate the amygdala segmentation into three critical phases: 1) robust global localization, 2) precise delineation and 3) generalizable segmentation. In examining the structure of the amygdala, the observer must first capture the entire cerebral image and subsequently estimate the approximate position of the amygdala. This estimate relies on prior knowledge of the anatomy of the limbic system, where the amygdala is located, and considers adjacent structures such as the hippocampus. Subsequent to this initial phase, the observer leverages a meticulous understanding of the amyg- dala’s internal morphology, gray matter intensities, and other pertinent information to execute a detailed regional delineation. To enhance the segmentation process, a transformer-based algorithm is employed to discern boundary contrasts. This approach aims to improve both the robustness of global amygdala localization and the precision following key elements. 1. To achieve comprehensive detection of amygdala positioning in T1-weighted (T1w) images, we employed a transformer-based network named BOLT3D. The BOLT3D model constructs a multigranularity adaptive collaboration (MGAC) architecture, integrating a global coarse-grained perceptual module to elucidate the global semantics of the amygdala structure and enhance positional sensitivity. Given that intricate details are often neglected in global representations, a local fine-grained enhancement module was developed to augment the perception and retention of detailed information. To harmonize coarse-grained global and fine-grained local data, a multi-granular adaptive fusion module is introduced. This allows the model to concurrently consider the differences between the entire amygdala and adjacent structures, as well as the similarities within the amygdala. This design facilitates the recognition of global positioning and local disparity features, thereby improving the localization accuracy and robustness of amygdala structures. The overarch- ing design objective is to accomplish a more precise and exhaustive detection of amygdala localization contours. 2. To address the challenge of dependency on manual segmentation boundaries and enhance the congruence between predicted and actual delineations, a novel learning strategy for boundary contrasts is introduced. This method enhances the discrim- inability of limbic structures from adjacent tissues by amplifying the characteristic differences between the amygdala and its surrounding tissues, while minimizing the intra-amygdala variations. Consequently, this refines the alignment between automated boundary segmentation and manual segmentation outcomes, thereby enabling a more precise demarcation of the amygdala boundaries. 3. To ensure the generalization efficacy of BOLT3D, a Segment Anything model (SAM) is devised for the refinement of coarse predictions. Specifically, the coarse outputs of the MAGC module are sampled as point cues for the SAM model, uti- lizing the coarse segmentation as a pre-segmentation step for further refinement. Concurrently, the original SAM model is adapted to the amygdala context, compris- ing three essential components: a lightweight volumetric feature encoder, a 3D cue encoder, and a volumetric mask decoder, thereby enhancing the model’s generalized segmentation performance. Initially, we derived global and local semantic features from the original MRI image data employing a multigranularity semantic generation module as depicted in Figure 1(b). Specifically, for T1w image data I, the multigranularity semantic gen- eration module exploits the local induction capability of convolution by employing two 3D convolutions to extract the primary local features Fl. This module facilitates the computation of the interrelationships among feature points, thereby enabling the extraction of global semantic information from regions that exhibit high response in the initial position features. Subsequently, we construct the preliminary global feature Fg. Given a feature map F of dimensions d × H × W , F is derived from the input image I via a single convolutional layer and subsequently projected onto a weight map and a mapping F through two convolutional layers. The channel count on the weight map is hw (h ≤ H, w ≤ W ), where h and w represent the dimensions of the predefined global semantic map. The weight map is then flattened for the Softmax computation, and the resulting weights are used to aggregate the semantic informa- tion within the F mapping by matrix multiplication, resulting in Fg. For succinctness in the illustration, dimensions are presented in abbreviated form. The MGAC module is composed of three components: a global module for coarse- grained perception, a local module for fine-grained enhancement, and an adaptive module for multigranularity fusion, as depicted in Figure 1(c). These components interactively to enhance the model’s performance. Figure 1(b) illustrates the position- ing of the adaptive MGAC module within the overall architecture, while Figure 1(c) Each MGAC module receives two inputs, specifically global coarse-grained seman- tic characteristics Fg and local fine-grained semantic features Fl. To mitigate the tics, BatchNorm3D is used to normalize the inputs. Furthermore, the linear position projection from previous work is mapped according to the positional relationships of the elements, ensuring that the arrangement of tokens within the transformer 2021). However, this approach neglects local structural information, which is vital for image data. Although integrating positional encoding can enable the transformer to extensive training data, which poses a challenge in the realm of medical image anal- layers, thereby incorporating the inductive bias inherent to convolutions. This substi- tution facilitates the preservation of local structural information intrinsic to the image The three-dimensional depth-wise convolutionary technique is employed to con- tant features, denoted Fg and Fl, are subsequently flattened into a one-dimensional sequence to facilitate Transformer processing. Upon this transformation, Fg is con- g and a global content vector F v g . Similarly, Fl, which encapsulates detailed information, is transformed into a local index vector F k l and a local content vector F v l through analogous operations. Regarding the global coarse-grained perception module and the local fine-grained enhancement module, their internal architectures remain consistent, as illustrated in Figure 1b. These modules primarily comprise two components: a multi-head self-attention mechanism, Zl replaces the input and is initially expanded to a one- dimensional sequence. A fully connected layer then serves as the transformation layer, converting the input into a query vector, an index vector, and a content vector. Subse- quently, the multi-head attention matrix is computed by formula 1. The feedforward layer further refines the interrelationships among voxel features, while integration with the residual mechanism augments data flow. This approach proficiently preserves the original features and mitigates gradient vanishing, as detailed in formula 2. l = M HSA (LN (Zl)) + Zl, l′ = F F N (LN (Z ′ In this context, M HSA(·) denotes the multi-head self-attention mechanism, LN (·) signifies layer normalization, and F F N (·) represents the feedforward neural network. The global coarse-grained perception module and the local fine-grained enhancement module employ the computational algorithms delineated in formulas 1 and 2, respec- tively, to transform the global content vector F v g and the local content vector F v inputs. Upon completion of the processing, the resulting updated global content vector g′ and the local content vector F v F v l′ are obtained. Within the context of the adaptive multigranularity fusion module, as illustrated in Figure 1, the correlation matrix Att is derived using F q g as the query vector and F k l as the index vector. The correlation is computed by applying the formula 3, as follows: Atti,j denotes the i-th voxel characteristic within the global query vector F q the corresponding i -th voxel characteristic in the local index vector F k l . The corre- lation score between the characteristics of the j th voxel is computed accordingly. To mitigate overly concentrated correlations in specific local regions and facilitate the model optimization process, a scaling factor of 1/ dk is implemented, where dk signi- fies the dimension of an individual attention head in terms of the number of channels Upon deriving the similarity matrix Att, it is necessary to remap it into the orig- inal value space, comprising both the global content vector space F v g and the local content vector space F v l . Specifically, given the similarity matrix Att, for the local fine-grained branch F v l , Att undergoes direct propagation into a Softmax function to produce a sparse feature distribution. This distribution is then subjected to matrix multiplication with F v l , followed by convolution operations to further refine the feature distribution. This operational sequence is encapsulated in Equation 4. In contrast, for the global coarse-grained branch F v g , the matrix Att requires transposition to deter- mine the similarity score between the individual feature points and the query feature. Subsequently, matrix multiplication with F v g is performed, and the resultant prod- uct is processed through deep separable convolutions to enhance the smoothness of the feature distribution. In addition, a residual technique is employed to preserve the integrity of the information and mitigate issues of vanishing gradients. Ultimately, this module yields the outputs F sof tmax(Att)F v l sof tmax(Att⊤)F v g A vast majority of existing 3D segmentation algorithms (C¸ i¸cek et al, 2016; Chen et al, 2019; Jiang et al, 2022) typically neglect explicit segmentation of structural bound- aries. However, certain algorithms strive to improve boundary delineation through attention mechanisms (Liu et al, 2023a; Cheng et al, 2019). Despite these efforts, there remains a paucity of comprehensive and targeted research focused on evaluating the influence of boundary regions on segmentation performance, resulting in subopti- mal overall model performance. To address this gap, we propose to meticulously align boundary information from manual annotations with model segmentation outputs and introduce an innovative boundary contrast learning framework. Previous contrastive learning methodologies have been predominantly applied at the image level. For example, positional (Tang et al, 2022) extends 3D images to 2D sequences and takes advantage of positional relationships within the 2D sequence to determine spatial relationships between positive and negative samples for contrastive learning. Mask Transfiner (Ke et al, 2022) adopts contrastive learning in image patches rather than at the image level, utilizing pseudolabels to derive patches with dis- tinct semantic categories to form positive and negative sample pairs. However, these approaches are inadequate for high-resolution segmentation, since accurate amygdala segmentation requires proximity of same-type pixels throughout the 3D image, separa- tion of different-type pixels, and clustering of pixels based on their labels. Therefore, in this study, the boundary pixels are used to construct positive and negative sample pairs to maximize the distinction between the boundary pixels and adjacent nonrelevant pixels, as illustrated in Figure 1(d). Specifically, we designate the local neighborhood around the boundary as a subset, creating the boundary contrast learning strategy from overlapping 3D patch areas distributed throughout the 3D space. For each sub- set, kernels adjacent to the boundary select a 3D patch space dimension. Manually segmented amygdala data serve as a basis for constructing positive and negative sam- ples. The InfoNCE information maximization algorithm (Radford et al, 2021) is then utilized to calculate the disparity between positive and negative samples in the lati- tude space on the hypersphere. Taking into account the anatomical dimensions of the amygdala, the size of the kernel is set to 5 × 5 × 5, and each subset forms positive and negative samples within this specified area. As illustrated in Figure 1, the formula 6 is specifically designed to focus on the boundary voxels by exclusively computing them. Initially, all boundary regions Bl in manual annotations are considered, and for each voxel xi in Bl, the sampling scope for positive and negative voxels is confined to its local neighborhood Ni. Under this constraint, the positive sample xj ∈ Ni ∧ li = lj for the boundary voxel xi is identified, while the remaining neighboring voxels are treated as negative samples xj ∈ Ni ∧ li ̸= lj. In this paper, j denotes the sample voxel within the neighborhood Ni corresponding to the voxel i, with li and lj representing the categories of differ- ent voxels xi and xj, respectively. Consequently, the boundary voxel contrast learning algorithm enhances the feature discernment of structurally organized boundary voxels, thus establishing the target for contrast optimization within boundary voxels, which is crucial for enhancing the segmentation of boundary regions. Specifically, for voxels xi within boundary regions Bl, learned representations are incentivized to be more congruent with voxel features of the same category while being less congruent with features of disparate categories. Similarly, there are: exp(−d(fi, fj)/τ ) exp(−d(fi, fk)/τ ) Here, fi denotes the representation of the characteristics of xi, d(·, ·) denotes the distance function, and τ represents the temperature coefficient in contrastive learn- while the denominator reflects the similarity between positive and negative instances. Consequently, a higher intraclass similarity coupled with a lower interclass similarity results in a reduced loss. The temperature coefficient is a predefined hyperparameter that governs the model’s sensitivity to negative samples. An increased temperature coefficient τ flattens the distribution of d(fi, fj), leading to a uniform treatment of all negative samples by contrastive loss, which diminishes the model’s learning efficacy. Conversely, setting the temperature coefficient too low directs the model’s focus toward particularly challenging negative samples, which might actually be potential posi- tive samples. This hampers the model’s convergence and degrades its generalization capability. Hence, the determination of the temperature coefficient is crucial. Consistency Module with SAM We use the SAM framework to develop a consistency strategy to mitigate the discrep- ancies that arise from the scanning of different subjects. This strategy comprises three integral components: the volume feature encoder, the 3D cue encoder, and the volume mask decoder. Specifically, the principal contributions can be delineated as follows. Firstly, we introduce an SAM model tailored for the amygdala segmentation task. Unlike existing approaches to improving SAM, the novelty of our model lies in its com- prehensive consideration of factors such as the volume, shape, and relative position of the amygdala. It eschews the conventional slice-by-slice feature extraction in favor of a holistic total volume approach. This method establishes inter-slice associations, rendering it exceptionally suited for structures with intricate core regions. In contrast to traditional algorithms, this model provides a more comprehensive representation of anatomical structures, particularly for smaller entities. Secondly, the incorporation of a 3D prompt encoder ensures the preservation of prior spatial position information and the 3D spatial features provided by the user. In contrast to the 2D prompt encoder, it furnishes more precise relative position cues in a multi-dimensional space. To facilitate the effective amalgamation of the 3D cue information with the embedding features derived from the volume feature encoder, we have devised a volume mask decoder. This decoder harnesses the interaction mechanism between a prior cue embedding and the MRI embedding, facilitating seamless integration. This fusion mechanism adeptly captures nuanced details within the feature space, offering a robust tool for the precise depiction of anatomical structures. SAM constitutes an interactive segmentation methodology predicated on iterative operations, enhancing the model’s representational capacity through the incorporation of positional cues and pre-segmentation data, thereby facilitating continuous optimiza- tion of segmentation accuracy via multiple interactive iterations. In particular, when existing SAM models are applied directly to medical imaging tasks, specifically the amygdala segmentation task, their accuracy is suboptimal. To address this issue, we have meticulously tailored the design of the 2D SAM model for the amygdala seg- mentation context and introduced an advanced SAM model, which comprises three integral encoders for the volume feature, the 3D cue and the volume mask. The function of the Volume Feature Encoder is to transform the input T1w struc- tural image into an MRI embedding vector. Compared to the 2D encoder in the traditional SAM, it allows simultaneous consideration of volume, shape, and relative position, thus offering a more comprehensive representation of anatomical structures and enhancing the processing of complex structures around the core area. To incor- porate interactive cues and existing amygdala segmentation results, a 3D cue encoder is used to encode this prior information. The 3D cue encoder comprises two com- ponents: the click-cue branch and the pre-segmentation cue branch. The click-cue branch converts user-provided cue points into learnable location embedding features to more precisely delineate the location of the amygdala. The pre-segmentation prompt encoder uses the last click of the model during interactive segmentation as input or feeds the pre-segmentation result into the model, thereby prompting the model to adjust and optimize the current segmentation result. To effectively integrate the cue encoder’s information with the feature embedding produced by the feature encoder, and to retrieve and refine the information pertaining to the amygdala, we devise a vol- ume mask detector to ensure the seamless alignment between cue feature information and the original feature encoder output. As the pivotal component, the volume mask decoder is principally designed to exhaustively explore key characteristics within the amygdala, thereby enhancing the model’s efficacy in intricate medical contexts. Its fundamental function is to amalga- mate the MRI embedding vector resulting from the volume feature encoder with the user-provided prompt inputs to ascertain the correlation between them, culminating in precise predictive results. The 3D mask decoder emits MRI embedding and cue embedding through a multi-layered fusion 3D feature encoder, facilitating multi-level and multi-perspective information extraction. This comprehensive fusion mechanism enables the model to assimilate MRI images more profoundly and improves the dis- cernment of medical structures, thus increasing predictive precision. In conclusion, the decoder produces precise predictions of specific structures or lesions within medical images, offering crucial support for clinicians to make accurate diagnoses and devise treatment strategies. We implement an advanced deep-supervised strategy for the formulation of the loss function. Specifically, this involves the integration of supervisory signals in each inter- mediate module and the terminal module, thereby facilitating enhanced gradient propagation and optimizing the efficiency of network training. For each supervisory signal, we incorporate two distinct loss functions, namely, the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss and the Dice loss. The overall loss function is constructed as follows. To address the issue of imbalance between positive (amygdala) and negative (other tissue) samples in the loss of BCE, an adapted version is employed. For simplicity, the l=0(gi,j = l)logP r(pi,j = l|Ψ) W where l ∈ (0, 1) denotes two categories of labels. The variables pi,j and gi,j represent the predicted and ground truth values, respectively, at the spatial coordinate (i, j) within a CT image characterized by a width of W and a height of H. The symbol Ψ encompasses all parameters of the model and P r(pi,j = l) signifies the predicted probability. The term αi,j ∈ [0, 1] stands for the pixel-specific weight. We define α as where Ai,j denotes the region adjacent to the pixel (i, j), and | · | signifies the calculation of the absolute value. Moreover, the Dice loss is defined as Our algorithm was implemented utilizing the PyTorch framework and utilizes the full capabilities of the Tesla A10 GPU to optimize computational efficiency. AdamW opti- mizer (Xu et al, 2022), a common choice within the transformer architecture domain, was used for routine updates of network parameters. The learning rate was meticu- lously set to 1e − 4 and the weight decay was equally adjusted to 1e − 4 to achieve an equilibrium between the stability of the training and the convergence speed of the model. To mitigate memory consumption, a batch size of 1 was designated, and the training process encompassed 100 iterations. This configuration ensures that the model undergoes sufficient training cycles to attain optimal performance and effectively dis- cern feature representations. During the testing phase, the input image dimensions were reduced to 48 × 64 × 80 to minimize computational demands. Subsequently, no post-processing optimization techniques were employed, thereby ensuring an objective assessment of model performance. In this study, neuroimaging data of human brain scans from three cohorts, includ- ing the Chongqing cohort of the Chinese Color Nest Cohort (CKG-CCNC) (Fan et al, 2023; Liu et al, 2021; Yang et al, 2017), the Beijing Normal University Childhood (Sun et al, 2022) and the Zhejiang University Mul- ticenter Traveler Cohort (ZJU-MTC) (Tong et al, 2020), were used. CKG-CCNC is part of the development component of CCNP (devCCNP), which was collected at Southwest University in Chongqing, China. The devCCNP aims to map normative brain development trajectories within the Chinese population during school years. The devCCNP-CKG dataset included data from 201 participants aged 6-17 years, who were invited to participate in three consecutive waves of data collection at intervals of approximately 1.25 years. At these time points, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1w) was performed and images were visually inspected to exclude those with significant head movement artifacts and structural abnormalities. After this ini- tial quality control, the final sample included 427 scans from 198 participants (105 girls and 93 boys). The distribution of participants with one, two and three scans was 48, 71, and 79, respectively, with an average of 2.16 scans per participant. BNU-CAC aims to investigate the impact of childhood adversity on brain development. It consists of 116 subjects (60 girls and 56 boys) aged 8-13 years who have been scanned once per individual and passed quality control protocols. ZJU-MTC includes three adult travelers (Tong et al, 2020) to evaluate image consistency between centers under iden- tical parameters with data collection performed across 10 scanning centers, ensuring comprehensive inter-center comparability. To rigorously assess the model’s performance, standard evaluation metrics for med- ical image segmentation have been incorporated, primarily encompassing similarity metrics and distance-based metrics. These include the Dice coefficient (Milletari et al, 2016) and the Jaccard coefficient (JS), the average surface distance (ASD) and the average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) (Berhane et al, 2020), and the relative volume difference (RVD) (Wang et al, 2008). In addition, precision and recall metrics derived from the confusion matrix are also utilized (Borji et al, 2015). Details of these Dice similarity coefficient (Dice) is used to measure the similarity between 2|VSeg ∩ VGT| |VSeg| + |VGT| where VSeg and VGT represent the voxel sets of the segmentation and GT, respectively. | · | denotes the operation of cardinality computation, which provides the number of elements in a set. Intersection over Union (IoU) is the area of intersection between the predicted segments and the labels divided by the area of union between the predicted segments and the labels. |VSeg ∩ VGT| |VSeg ∪ VGT| Average Surface Distance (ASSD) is a metric based on the surface distance defined as the average distance between the surface voxel S(VSeg) of the segmentation |S(VSeg)| + |S(VGT)| d sVSeg, S(VGT) + d (sVGT , S(VSeg)) where d(s, S(X)) is defined as the minimum Euclidean distance from the voxel s to the surface voxel of the volume X. Relative Volume Difference (RVD) is used to measure the difference between predicted lung infections and GT. We take the absolute value of RVD and report the corresponding results in this work. |VSeg| − |VGT| |VGT| Asymmetry index (AI) assesses the degree of lateralization of the left and right amygdala and is defined as Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) reflects the consistency of results across multiple centers and is defined as (M SB − M SW ) M SB + (k − 1) ∗ M SW M SB denotes the mean square between groups, M SW denotes the mean square within groups, and k is the number of raters. BOLT3D demonstrates unequivocal superiority within the test cohort, attaining exem- plary performance in critical metrics including Dice, JS and HD95 relative to other prevalent algorithms. A comprehensive analysis of these individual metrics and the pronounced performance benefits conferred by BOLT3D on various parameters is presented in Table 1. The Dice coefficient and the JS coefficient serve as imperative metrics for evaluating the extent of overlap in segmentation outcomes. BOLT3D achieves a Dice coefficient of (0.787), and ResU-Net3D (0.841). Analogously, the JS coefficient demonstrates a com- superior segmentation precision. The HD95 and the ASSD quantify the spatial discrep- highlighting the interval between the segmented boundary of the amygdala and the of 1.097 relative to other algorithms such as U-Net3D (1.565), U-Net3D++ (1.963), and ResU-Net3D (1.669). This shows that BOLT3D excels in preserving spatial con- and recall metrics are used to assess false positives. The precision metric quantifies the Table 1: Amygdala index results of 347 scans in the CKG-CCNC cohort proportion of true positive instances among those designated as positive by the model, whereas the recall metric evaluates the proportion of true positive instances correctly identified by the model from all positive instances in the dataset. BOLT3D’s precision and recall are 0.883 and 0.929, respectively, surpassing the performance of other algo- rithms. BOLT3D manifests an admirable balance between these metrics, resulting in an overall superior performance relative to other algorithms. Additionally, BOLT3D achieves a relative RVD of 0.056, significantly lower than that of other algorithms, thereby highlighting the algorithm’s exceptional accuracy in volume prediction. Figure 2 elucidates the comparative segmentation outcomes across multiple algo- rithms on a representative subject, illustrating the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with respect to volumetric and boundary concordance with man- Freesurfer deviates markedly from both the morphological and manual segmentation results. The presence of numerous spaces indicates an inability to accurately capture the structural integrity of the actual amygdala. A closer inspection of its periph- eries reveals that the Freesurfer exhibits numerous irregularities when juxtaposed with the gold standard. The amygdala delineated by Unet exhibits morphological char- acteristics comparable to those of the gold standard. However, an assessment of the superposition effect and edge segmentation results reveals that the volumetric delin- eation by Unet is substantially overestimated. In contrast, our BOLT3D results exhibit a morphological resemblance closer to the gold standard. The superposition effect in BOLT3D is similarly congruent with the gold standard, demonstrating no signifi- cant volumetric overestimation or underestimation, which is corroborated by the edge segmentation results. The superiority of BOLT3D is primarily attributable to the integration of Transformer technology with a boundary contrast learning algorithm, thus improving its ability to capture intricate structural details in the image while\n",
