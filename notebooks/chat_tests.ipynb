      "Most relevant chunks: 'Early lesion studies showed that regions such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (39) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) (40), which are involved in shock conditioning, are also required for predator odor-induced fear learning. Additionally, the medial amygdala (MeA) (41), which is not involved in shock conditioning, was identified as a novel component of the fear learning in this context. Recent research using muscimol inactivation indicates that the posterior insular cortex (pIC) is crucial for both the formation and recall of predator odor-induced contextual fear memories (42) The insular cortex has been associated with processing negative emotions and cognitive information related to fear, anxiety, and disgust (11, 43). Animal studies have demonstrated that optogenetic activation of pIC induces an aversive state in mice (44) and insular cortex activity is crucial for the maintenance of learned fear (45). In humans, the affective and social pain correlates with activity in the ACC and insular (11, 46, 47). Also, in a fear learning using aversive pictures as US, the insular cortex shows increased activation when exposed to both the aversive picture and the CS (48, 49). Moreover, lesions in the insular cortex can result in pain asymbolia (50), where pain sensation is present but the unpleasantness is not perceived. These findings suggest that the insular cortex plays a crucial role in representing negative emotions and affect rather than processing somatosensory information related to nociception. Notably, the insular cortex has substantial reciprocal connections with the PBN (51, 52). The insular cortex may convey affective information to the PBN.'\n",

      "Most relevant chunks: 'We found that neurons in the ventral CA1 region (vCA1) of the mouse hippocampus encoded the identities and social properties, specifically sex and strain, of familiar conspecifics by using both rate and theta-based temporal coding. Optogenetic reactivation of social memories of females, but not males, induced place preference. Ablation of the upstream medial amygdala (MeA) or the hippocampal dorsal CA2 region (dCA2) disrupted the representation of sex and the sexual dimorphism of social memory valence. Selective reactivation of overlapping neural populations of distinct female social memories representing the female sex was sufficient to induce preference. Thus, vCA1 neurons employ dual coding schemes to represent the identities and social properties of familiar conspecifics as a cohesive memory. Social memory in the mouse ventral hippocampus maps the identities and social properties of familiar conspecifics. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the integration of multimodal information into a conceptualized cognitive map, which is fundamental for recalling specific experiences and guiding behaviors (1). Social memory is a key component of episodic or declarative memory, which enables the recognition of familiar individuals. Extensive animal studies, particularly using rodent models, have underscored the crucial role of the hippocampus in processing social memory. Located along the hippocampal septotemporal axis, the dorsal CA2 region (dCA2) specializes in encoding social stimuli (2, 3), whereas the ventral CA1 region (vCA1), which receives projections from the dCA2 (4), is responsible for storing memories of familiar conspecifics (5) through the temporal coordination of neuronal population activities (6). Notably, a recent study of rats revealed that neuronal responses in the vCA1 to familiar conspecifics showed greater variability among individual females than the responses among males (7), and this suggested a potential sexually dimorphic component in hippocampal social memory.'\n",

Traditionally, neuroimaging research on affective processes in humans has relied on experimental paradigms employing isolated and sparsely presented stimuli in a single modality (e.g., affective pictures) and analytic approaches that aim at localizing brain regions that show the highest increase in activity by conducting numerous tests across individual ‘voxels’ or regions – strategies characterized by a low ecological validity for dynamic emotional processes in everyday life29 and low to moderate effect sizes30 and reliability31 in terms of characterizing affective mental processes12,14,16,32. Recent advances have successfully leveraged neuroimaging combined with machine learning algorithms (i.e., multivariate pattern analysis, MVPA) to develop predictive and more precise and comprehensive neural signatures for subjective affective experiences characterized by a specific emotional state and high negative affective arousal, including general negative affect12,32, pain33, disgust13, fear14,15 and anxious anticipation16. The advances allowed to predict the specific subjective affective state with greater effect sizes and robustness compared to traditional local region-based approaches34,35 and to demonstrate that the specific emotional states are characterized by common and distinct brain-wide neural representations between subjective emotional states or high affective arousal, respectively15,16. This holds the potential to improve the description of mental processes at the brain level36. This approach has refined our understanding of affective experiences by demonstrating that they are encoded in distributed brain systems, which is aligned with meta-analytic evidence indicating that affective experiences are linked to activations across a wide array of brain regions37.'\n",

Our aim was to investigate whether maternal pre- and postnatal depressive symptoms associate with 5- year-olds’ local connectivity across the whole brain as assessed by regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure derived from task-free fMRI while the participants were watching Inscapes movie (Vanderwal et al., 2015). Second, replicating the analyses in prior work (Soe et al., 2018), we mapped the association of maternal depressive symptoms to bilateral amygdala seed-based connectivity. Third, multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between maternal depressive symptoms and bilateral amygdala ReHo values. This was an exploratory study and thus no explicit hypotheses were placed regarding the direction or strength of the associations.

      "Most relevant chunks: 'These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence. Episodic memory is supported by the hippocampus, a heterogeneous brain structure with distinct functional and anatomical properties along its dorsoventral axis (Fanselow and Dong 2010; Bannerman et al. 2004; Strange et al. 2014). The dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) encodes spatial representations of the environment through the activity of place cells, which code for specific locations called place fields (O’Keefe 1976; M. a Wilson and McNaughton 1993). During NREM sleep (slow- wave sleep), these spatial representations are reactivated (M. Wilson and McNaughton 1994; Skaggs and McNaughton 1996), preferentially during fast oscillatory hippocampal events known as “sharp-wave ripples” (SWRs) (Buzsáki 2015). Dorsal SWRs support spatial (Gabrielle Girardeau et al. 2009; Ego-Stengel and Wilson 2009) and contextual fear (Wang et al. 2015) memory consolidation. Interestingly, dHPC spatial representations can be modulated by the emotional valence of the environment, notably through remapping (Moita et al. 2004; D. Wang et al. 2015; Schuette et al. 2020; Hollup et al. 2001; Dupret et al. 2010). Moreover, dHPC sleep reactivations after an aversive experience can occur conjointly with the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (G. Girardeau, Inema, and Buzsáki 2017), which is involved in fear processing, and other emotion-processing structures (Lansink et al. 2008; 2009; Pennartz et al. 2009).'\n",

      "  Authors Names: Haoming Qi,Dongcheng He\n",
      "Most relevant chunks: 'Deception, inherently a type of social behavior, often involves emotions as a critical medium in these interactions. The role of frontal activities in emotion has been investigated for decades. Early studies on people with cortical lesions have suggested the asymmetrical involvement of prefrontal regions to positive and negative emotions (Goldstein, 1944), which has been confirmed by subsequent studies (Gainotti, 1972; Robinson and Price, 1982). In the context of social interaction like deception, the roles of frontal cortex on social modulation involve various of functions (Harmon-Jones et al., 2009). Particularly, previous studies have demonstrated the relation between the left frontal electrical activities and the emotion states of facial expression, with increased activation during joyful expressions (Ekman and Davidson, 1993; Graham and Cabeza; 2001). Similar asymmetrical frontal activities were also found to reflect the emotional motivation directions. For example, promotion was found to be related to higher asymmetrical bilateral frontal activations than prevention (Amodio et al., 2004). The dynamics of such emotional motivation may play an active role during deception. For example, guilt, an important emotional component in deception (Battigalli et al., 2013; Seiter and Bruschke, 2007), has been linked to both increased and reduced motivation varying over time (Amodio et al., To sort out the frontal activities during deception at a social interaction aspect, this study analyzed an EEG dataset collected from a player and an observer simultaneously during a task designed to encourage deception. At each time, the player decided to relay either the true or a false information to the observer, who watched the player’s facial expression before choosing to trust or doubt the player.'\n",

      "Most relevant chunks: 'A dynorphin-expressing subpopulation within the central amygdala (CeADyn) has been implicated in excessive alcohol drinking across both acute and chronic alcohol exposure models (for review: Walker et al 2021). Yet, how cellular activity of CeADyn neurons is impacted by active alcohol drinking is not well-understood. Thus, it is pivotal to better understand specific brain mechanisms underlying the behavioral and physiological responses to alcohol that promote alcohol misuse. The amygdala complex itself is a complex structure of five major subdivisions and up to 13 different sub-nuclei. The central amygdala (CeA) has three sub-nuclei comprised of heterogeneous GABAergic neurons that express different neuropeptides. Of the diverse neuropeptide populations in the CeA, dynorphin-expressing CeA neurons (CeADyn) are known to regulate both binge alcohol drinking and stress-enhanced drinking in alcohol dependence (Anderson et al 2019, Haun et al 2022, Bloodgood et al 2020). CeADyn signaling disruption influences alcohol drinking in a sex-dependent manner and, similarly, prolonged alcohol exposure increases excitability of CeADyn neurons in male, but not female mice (Bloodgood et al 2020). How real-time activity of CeADyn neurons relates to alcohol drinking is not well explored, nor is it clear why alcohol exposure would differentially affect male and female CeADyn activity. The current studies were designed to investigate CeADyn neuron activity dynamics relative to alcohol drinking, whether these effects differ depending on biological sex, and whether consumption of other solutions also similarly engage CeADyn neurons. To capture real-time activity of CeADyn neurons during voluntary consumption of alcohol, water, and sucrose, we used in vivo fiber photometry in freely behaving male and female (pro)Dyn-Cre mice.'\n",

      "Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it is made up of different colors of light, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n",
      "2. **Light interacts with gas molecules**: As the sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are randomly moving around due to thermal energy.\n",
      "3. **Scattering occurs**: When light hits these gas molecules, it scatters in all directions. This scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths of light, which correspond to blue and violet colors.\n",
      "4. **Blue light is scattered more**: Since blue light has a shorter wavelength (around 450-495 nanometers), it is scattered more than other colors by the tiny gas molecules. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described this phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n",
      "5. **Our eyes perceive the scattered blue light**: As a result of this scattering, we see the sky appear blue during the daytime. The blue color we perceive is actually a combination of all the scattered blue light from the sun that reaches our eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink. This is because the sunlight has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach our eyes at these times, which scatters the shorter wavelengths (like blue) even more, leaving mainly longer wavelengths like red and orange visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, the sky appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by tiny gas molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, which favors shorter wavelengths like blue light.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question about the amygdala's role. First, I remember that the amygdala is part of the brain, specifically in the almond-shaped area at the base of the skull. It's often called the \"little brain.\" But what exactly does it do?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's mainly involved with emotions like fear and anger. Maybe it processes things like sounds or sights that could be dangerous? I've heard terms like conditioned reflexes related to amygdala function. Also, during stress, the amygdala might get more active.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, isn't there something about the prefrontal cortex interacting with the amygdala? Oh right, the amygdala helps regulate emotions and behaviors that prepare the body for action in case of danger. So when it detects a threat, it triggers fear responses. But how does it do that exactly?\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that the amygdala is linked to memory, maybe storing past experiences with trauma or scary situations. That could explain why people are more fearful after traumatic events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, during sleep stages like REM, the amygdala becomes active again, which might be related to REM Dreams and emotional processing during sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together: the amygdala is crucial for detecting threats, regulating fear responses, preparing the body, associating with memories of danger, and even playing a role in emotional experiences during sleep.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The amygdala plays a vital role as a part of the brain located at the base of the skull. Primarily known for its involvement in processing emotions such as fear and anger, it acts as a detector for potential threats or dangers. The amygdala's activation can lead to conditioned reflexes and stress responses. It interacts with other brain regions like the prefrontal cortex to regulate fear responses and prepare the body for action. Additionally, it is linked to memory formation, particularly storing experiences of trauma or danger. Furthermore, during REM sleep, the amygdala becomes active again, contributing to emotional processing during sleep stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The amygdala functions as a critical region in the brain responsible for detecting potential threats and regulating fear responses. It activates conditioned reflexes and prepares the body for action, often under stress. The amygdala also links with memory formation, particularly for trauma-related experiences, and plays a role in emotional processing during REM sleep.\n"
